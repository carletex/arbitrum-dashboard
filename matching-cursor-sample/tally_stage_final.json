    "description": "# AIP: ArbOS Version 11\n# AIP: ArbOS Version 11\n\n# Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP introduces a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including support for the EVM Shanghai upgrade and the PUSH0 opcode, along with miscellaneous bug fixes. These improvements are now audited and ready for adoption, including by Arbitrum Orbit chains, Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal concerns the latter two, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum's equivalent of a hardfork - more can be read about the subject over in https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695\n\n## Changes Included\n\n### 1. EVM Shanghai support (including the PUSH0 opcode)\n\nRecent versions of go-ethereum already includes support for the changes to the EVM made in the Shanghai L1 upgrade, but we need to enable them for Arbitrum chains. Instead of using a time based activation, it\u2019s better to activate support based on the ArbOS version, which makes sure that even if the upgrade is delayed, Shanghai support will take effect uniformly and without causing divergences with out of date node software.\n\nPRs:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1583>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1664>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1712>\n\n### 2. Retryable fixes\n\nRetryable fees previously always used the network fee account, instead of also using the infrastructure fee account. The infrastructure fee account should be paid fees from the basefee, and the network fee account should be paid any surplus fees when the gas price is elevated. That was correctly implemented for normal transactions, but retryables only dealt with the network fee account. Retryable redemption also reported an incorrect gas usage in the block header. This matters to Arbitrum Nova, where the infrastructure fee account pays out some fees to the Data Availability Committee members, but the network fee account does not.\n\nPRs:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1789>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1980>\n\n### 3. Fix the chain owner list returned by precompile\n\nThis change doesn\u2019t affect the actual chain owner set, but the list being returned by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile was incorrect for Arbitrum Nova due to an internal ArbOS issue. To be clear, this does not affect who was able to make chain owner actions. As intended, only the DAO is able to make chain owner actions on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This change only affects the list of chain owners presented by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile.\n\nPRs:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1525>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1768>\n\n### 4. Fix some precompile methods taking up all gas when reverting\n\nSome precompile methods such as ArbSys\u2019s arbBlockHash method took up all gas when reverting. That meant that if a transaction called arbBlockHash with an out-of-range block number, it\u2019d use up all the gas when reverting.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1490>\n\n### 5. Create missing precompile methods to view some L1 pricing parameters\n\nThe L1RewardReceipient and L1RewardRate were previously not exposed via precompiles. This change adds methods to get them to ArbGasInfo so that the current chain configuration can be easily checked.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1775>\n\n### 6. Fix the possibility of a staticcall from the owner to ArbOwner emitting a log\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t matter in practice, but it was theoretically for a staticcall from the chain owner to the ArbOwner precompile to emit a log. In the EVM, staticcalls should never be able to emit logs. This PR fixes the Arbitrum precompile logic to disallow emitting logs in staticcall contexts.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1562>\n\n### 7. Fix default L1 pricing params\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t matter for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, because these parameters were already corrected in [AIP-7](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-7-arbitrum-one-governance-parameter-fixes/15920). However, it\u2019s included in ArbOS version 11 so that any Arbitrum Orbit chains automatically get the correct parameters.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1549>\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe canonical version of ArbOS 11 this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash  `df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d`\n\nThat commit builds a WASM module root of `0xf4389b835497a910d7ba3ebfb77aa93da985634f3c052de1290360635be40c4a`, which is a hash of the code that\u2019s put on-chain for fraud proofs. You can verify this WASM module root on a x86\\_64 computer (i.e. not on ARM which builds slightly different symbol names) with Docker setup by checking out the previously mentioned commit of the nitro repository, running `git submodule update --init --recursive`, and then running `docker build . --target module-root-calc --tag wavm-machine && docker run --rm wavm-machine cat /workspace/target/machines/latest/module-root.txt` This uses Docker to perform a reproducible build of the WebAssembly code used in fraud proofs, and outputs its hash.\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwA1PK3AB9ggHMqaw91mubu5WHcEp398/view?usp=sharing>\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in\n\n<https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/170>\n\nAction contract addresses:\n[SetArbOneArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3b70f2da6f3b01f9a53dcbcb3e59ad3ad8bed924#code)\n[SetNovaArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x54c2c372943572ac2a8e84d502ebc13f14b62246#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF6c7Dc6eaE78aBF2f32df899654ca425Dfa99481#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x5357f4d3e8f8250a77bcddd5e58886ad1358220c#code)\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N3197Z7DuqBpu9qdt-GWPewe8HQakfLY/view?usp=sharing>\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference\n\nThe current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 10, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v10` git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x6b94a7fc388fd8ef3def759297828dc311761e88d8179c7ee8d3887dc554f3c3`, which is what the rollup contract\u2019s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo audit the code difference from ArbOS 10 to ArbOS 11, you could simple generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn\u2019t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 10 or ArbOS 11 with bash:\n\n`#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\nmkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output`\n\n`# this script should be run in the nitro repository`\n\n`git checkout df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '[]' | sed 's/ /\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '_test\\.go`\n\nNow, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 10 or 11. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\n`git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)`\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 10 and 11 used:\n\n`$ git ls-tree consensus-v10 go-ethereum                                                                                                                                                                                           128 \u21b5\n160000 commit 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298  go-ethereum\n$ git ls-tree df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d go-ethereum\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum`\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n`git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)`\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.10.25 and v1.11.6, as ArbOS 10 used the former and ArbOS 11 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: <https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf>\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 11\u2019s go-ethereum against ArbOS 10\u2019s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 11\u2019s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.11.6:\n\n`git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff\ngit diff v1.11.6 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff`\n\nIn addition, you can pass the following arguments to `diff-intersection.py` to ignore files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`\n\nNote that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag."

    "description": "# Entropy Advisors: Exclusively Working with the Arbitrum DAO, Y2-Y3\n## Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nEntropy Advisors was started by Matt Fiebach and Sam Martin with the vision of turning DAOs into sustainable and efficient organizations, and was bootstrapped via an Arbitrum Foundation grant. As the first two employees at Blockworks Research, we felt the vision of what DAOs could deliver versus what they actually resembled in reality warranted more dedicated attention from a team passionate about the potential impact DAOs could have on an ecosystem. It has now been 14 months since Entropy Advisors was incorporated, and while we have accomplished a lot, there is a vast amount of work that remains.\n\nAs this term comes to a close on August 31st, we want to take the opportunity to say thank you to those in the Arbitrum community who have supported our team and given us a path to make an impact on such a large stage by funding us through our first DAO\u00a0[proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22562217031893796518849144396978331510254494883851105730012486117405397295942). Without the Arbitrum DAO, Entropy Advisors would not have been possible.\n\nThis proposal is to extend our partnership with the DAO for two additional years. If passed, our second official engagement would go into effect on September 1, 2025, immediately following the conclusion of our first mandate. Entropy Advisors\u2019 exclusive focus over the next two years is transforming Arbitrum into the most effective capital allocating DAO in crypto, leveraging treasury strategy, incentives design, data, and special projects to drive compounding, sustainable ecosystem growth\n\n# Motivation and Rationale\n\n## Year 1 Retrospective\n\nWe invite everyone to review our initial\u00a0[proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-exclusively-working-with-arbitrum-dao/25246)\u00a0and reflect on our successes and failures, and to provide candid feedback to our team as we begin the process towards a second term.\n\n> ### Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)* Neutral Proposal Broker\n> * Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO. Facilitate introductions between delegates, contributors, DAO leaders, and key strategic partners.\n> * Assist with drafting and delivering proposals from select third parties to the DAO.\n> * Proposal Incubation\n> * Facilitate the oversight and creation of neutral DAO frameworks and initiatives that do not benefit Entropy and only have the DAO\u2019s best interests in mind.\n> * The idea behind Entropy is to assemble a team composed of highly capable DAO contributors with differing perspectives and expertises\u2014we will use our collective brain power to create proposals that benefit Arbitrum over the long term and are aligned with community priorities.\n> * Enable the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.### Strategy and Ecosystem Alignment* Serve as the liaison between Arbitrum\u2019s key stakeholders\n> * Host meetings with key stakeholders and report needs and updates between the relevant parties. Report notes to DAO when able.\n> * Turn conversations and takeaways into an actionable plan and begin executing.\n> * Product and Strategy\n> * Regularly discuss with application developers within the Arbitrum ecosystem, relay this information to development teams/the Foundation, and use the insights to create discussions with clear goals on the Arbitrum governance forum.\n> * Assist the key stakeholders on partnerships/integrations as needed. We will serve as an extra set of eyes to highlight emerging technologies and trends within crypto, aiding Arbitrum parties when we can be helpful.\n> * Generally speaking, ensure that the Arbitrum DAO is on track to becoming a sustainable entity with sensible spending and a focus on profit generation.\n\n**Full-time Arbitrum DAO:**\u00a0We grew the team from just Sam and Matt to 8 full-time and 1 intern, and we remain laser-focused on attracting the highest quality talent in the space to commit themselves exclusively to Arbitrum. While we believe that we have formed a very strong team thus far, the composition of our team will always be a top priority to ensure we have the tools at our disposal to serve the ecosystem with high-quality execution. In the coming year, we would like to continue growing as needs arise: more data analytics help, applied researchers, TradFi converts, and those with early-stage experience are at the top of mind, with a goal of scaling beyond 10 members on our team.\n\n\n[<img height=\"388\" width=\"690\" alt=\"TeamSlide\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/88e216931be7c9d4d55aff245cc551c383f6cca6_2_690x388.jpeg\" />TeamSlide3200\u00d71800 824 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/88e216931be7c9d4d55aff245cc551c383f6cca6.jpeg \"TeamSlide\")\n\n\n\n**Beyond Proposals:**\u00a0Over the past year, Entropy has evolved beyond just a proposals shop and become a recognizable, consistent face of the Arbitrum DAO in the broader crypto community. From press to partnerships, conferences to committees, we\u2019ve built a strong reputation for professionalism, reliability, and alignment. Our ability to foster trust across stakeholders from Offchain Labs and the Foundation to top investors, asset managers, and builders has been one of our most important assets, and something we intend to amplify in years 2 and 3. We recognize that this is where we have produced the most value throughout our first year and aim to continue to grow into our strengths. On countless occasions, we have joined Offchain Labs and Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s partnerships teams in helping outline strategy and closing deals. With some blue-chip ecosystem partners, Entropy works as their main point of contact in Arbitrum. We have grown into a trusted tool augmenting existing AAEs.\n\n**Syncing Stakeholders:**\u00a0We are happy with our output over the past ~year in regards to the first two deliverables we outlined (see above). We hosted three (a fourth is planned for EthCC) \u201cDelegate Days\u201d in Brussels, Bangkok, and Denver over the past year, where we gathered large delegates, members from Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation, and other stakeholders to align on key objectives over the subsequent quarter(s). We also hosted key stakeholder calls with the same groups once per month in an effort to align on high-importance topics that require attention in the near term. Entropy has also been speaking with OCL, the AF, and key delegates and ecosystem contributors every two weeks to streamline communications across the ecosystem. These efforts are quite time-consuming, but have proven to lead to some of our most impactful work over the past year.\n\n**Strategic Proposals:**\u00a0We successfully passed a plethora of proposals authored internally, as well as assisted third parties in drafting proposals to the DAO or submitting applications to DAO-led programs. Some examples here include Govhack Brussels, the MSS, The Ethereum Attackathon Sponsorship, leading the ARB staking working group and bolstering the quality of contributors to the research (bringing in Vending Machine and ASXN to assist), the Delegate Code of Conduct, establishing an events budget, getting treasury management moving forward after a long stagnation through the v1.2 proposal, leading the STEP II committee, moving forward with the MVP exercise to align stakeholders, our DRIP proposal to reignite incentives/support for builders and users, the Stylus Sprint, assisting Max Lomu with his chain abstraction proposal, etc. We can\u2019t touch on all of them here, but please refer to our forum\u00a0[profile](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/entropy/summary)\u00a0for more information.\n\nImportantly, in many cases, we evaluated whether supporting external contributors/committees or internalizing portions of execution made the most sense for the DAO. In some instances, we chose to execute internally, not because we wanted less external contribution, but because we deemed it the most efficient, high-context, and cost-effective way to get things done. Our north star has always been to make DAO execution smoother, more strategic, and resource-efficient. Sometimes that meant helping third parties structure their ideas, but other times it meant owning the process ourselves to ensure tighter execution, lower overhead, and greater accountability.\n\n**OpCo Groundwork:**\u00a0We also laid the groundwork for a more expedited proposal process by helping mold the new direction for the Arbitrum DAO, which was recently\u00a0[posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-vision-for-the-future-of-arbitrum/28962)\u00a0by the AF, and we also created the\u00a0[OpCo proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4)\u00a0that should make working with the DAO a much smoother process from the perspective of service providers.\n\nWe expect OpCo to pick up the portion of the aforementioned work that relates to key stakeholder alignment and coordination once it is fully operational. Aligning all the largest stakeholders in the ecosystem in order to allow for more effective operations was a massive undertaking and took a large amount of our bandwidth over the course of our first year. Despite the large investment of time and resources, we believe the groundwork has been laid for a more fruitful future for the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Learning from Mistakes:**\u00a0While we feel as though we did a great job on setting the DAO\u2019s future, more efficient path, we certainly fell short on numerous occasions. For example, there were some instances in which we poorly communicated with certain ecosystem participants during application processes. As members of the GMC, many protocols that have sunk significant resources into the ecosystem felt overlooked and undercommunicated with. Our team has since shifted focus to improving our relationships with Arbitrum builders and to being more mindful in providing feedback to applicants by overcommunicating. We also realize that our scope of work was extremely wide in our first proposal, and our deliverables have evolved quite a lot since our engagement started, which might have led to some confusion in the wider community around what Entropy\u2019s role actually is. Our wins have taught us a lot, but our mistakes even more, and we are committed to making corrections based on our learnings throughout our first year in our second engagement.\n\n> Data and Brand Building* Build up a high-value brand through various mediums, such as X/Twitter with educational content and research, YouTube/Apple/Spotify through a podcast, and email through weekly newsletters.\n> * Bring visibility into DAO initiatives and RFPs.\n> * Represent the DAO professionally and with a demeanor that the community can be proud of.\n> * Aid DAO-funded organizations like the ARDC and OBL in conducting research and analytics to inform proposal development.\n> * Utilize data analytics to help the DAO with accountability and transparency around its initiatives.\n\n**Arbitrum Analytics:**\u00a0In terms of data and brand building, we are very happy with our output over our first ~year. Our data team has created the go-to\u00a0[Dune catalog](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors)\u00a0for those looking for greater insight into the Arbitrum ecosystem. It is worth noting that our data team did not begin work until around the end of December, so we have accomplished a lot here in very little time. We have had numerous investors not currently involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem reach out in admiration, which we believe will have a positive downstream impact that is not easily quantifiable. We have also seen our charts shared across dozens of large accounts on X, featured in blogs and news articles, and referred to during big moments for the ecosystem, such as the rollout of\u00a0[Timeboost](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-timeboost). We have created a\u00a0[DAO financials](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-financials)\u00a0dashboard to give delegates better insight into how the DAO spends/earns money, a\u00a0[dashboard](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-governance-proposals)\u00a0that enables delegates to dissect various proposals at a granular level, an\u00a0[RWA case](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-rwa-case-study)\u00a0study, a\u00a0[DAO treasury](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-treasury)\u00a0dashboard showing all the assets it owns, and\u00a0[more](https://dune.com/discover/content/relevant?q=author:entropy_advisors\\&resource-type=dashboards).\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"351\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0557b4e63a43a6937af37c009f506b1c4bd271e3_2_624x351.jpeg\" />1600\u00d7900 290 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0557b4e63a43a6937af37c009f506b1c4bd271e3.jpeg)\n\n\n\n**Data as a Growth Support Mechanism:**\u00a0We also learned that data transparency can serve as a great tool for both increasing our reach across various crypto communities as well as improving relationships on the BD front with builders. This complements the goal stated in the previous section of helping to onboard 3rd parties into the ecosystem. For example, we created the most comprehensive data overview of Ethena, which caught the team\u2019s attention. Members of Entropy then worked with OCL to coordinate a trip to the UK at the end of 2024 to meet the Ethena team as they were deciding which tech stack to deploy Converge on. In April 2025, we saw these efforts pay off with Ethena and Securitize\u00a0[choosing the Arbitrum stack](https://x.com/convergeonchain/status/1912853619038461967).\n\nWe have ambitions to aid more builders within the Arbitrum ecosystem as a support mechanism, and to continue building resources that serve as both marketing material and a BD tool. Where we fell short on brand relative to our original proposal was podcast content/weekly newsletters. While we view this content as valuable, we simply did not have the bandwidth to prioritize these types of initiatives when considering the high-importance items we needed to facilitate. Additionally, we see room for growth as we expand our content outside of solely Arbitrum core and into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over the next 2 years, we will create more dashboards that cover apps and infra that are well-positioned to support the expansion of the Arbitrum tech stack, with the goal of encouraging more partners to consider an Arbitrum deployment/support.\n\n**Recognition by News Outlets:**\u00a0We regularly post threads on X and LinkedIn that highlight important initiatives that are ongoing in the Arbitrum DAO, but we do know that we need to expand our reach to maximize our impact. Members of the Entropy team have been quoted in The Block, Blockworks, CoinDesk, Unchained, and Yahoo Finance about our work in Arbitrum on numerous occasions. Additionally, we have represented Arbitrum on a few podcasts. at multiple conferences, and even in an official Arbitrum marketing video. Although we have plenty of room to keep improving our public brand, we are happy with the growth in the first year.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"351\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a67086041072675eeed75c3353d5f3baba744181_2_624x351.jpeg\" />1600\u00d7900 326 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a67086041072675eeed75c3353d5f3baba744181.jpeg)\n\n\n\n**Acknowledgment by Investors:**\u00a0Large ARB token holders have evidently taken notice of our ability to push forward initiatives, be more critical of each individual spending request, and our focus on ecosystem growth, long-term sustainability, and revenue diversification, which has manifested through our rise in voting power. Our ascension to the top of the\u00a0[ARB delegates](https://dune.com/queries/4713840/7834608)\u00a0by voting power is a responsibility we do not take lightly, and is something we are really proud of. In our opinion, this signals to us that we are prioritizing the right things and are in the early stages of helping steward the DAO\u2019s path forward.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Vision for Years 2 and 3\n\nNow that it\u2019s increasingly likely that the DAO\u2019s operational structure will include officially recognized AAEs, the path has been paved for Entropy Advisors to shift our focus more fully toward growth, sustainability, and strategic execution. While the OpCo comes to fruition, Entropy will continue to support operations- and oversight-focused initiatives that require continuity. Topics like administering the ARB Staking Working Group, supporting ARDC v2, leading programs like Watchdog and MSS, and maintaining the Delegate Code of Conduct will likely transition over to OpCo, and we will be here to ensure a smooth handoff. We expect this transition to be ongoing throughout the entirety of 2025, with the operations-related workload easing on Entropy\u2019s end by the beginning of 2026.\n\nEntropy Advisors\u2019 singular focus over the next two years is to help the Arbitrum DAO mature into a disciplined capital allocator. We will spearhead building an organization that drives compounding, sustainable ecosystem growth.\n\nArbitrum is now positioned to act more like a sovereign wealth fund: managing a composable treasury, deploying capital with strategic intent, and aligning incentives to deepen protocol adoption and ecosystem loyalty. Entropy\u2019s work across treasury design and management, incentive architecture, data transparency, and ecosystem relationships will operate in tandem to realize this vision.\n\nThe strategy boils down to:\n\n* Build a high-quality treasury of productive, composable assets (LSTs, T-bills, etc.)\n* Deploy a large share of holdings across DeFi as protocol-owned liquidity to generate yield, support aligned builders, and establish Arbitrum leverage. This function will also help onboard new partners, as the DAO will act as an initial source of demand\n* Layer in structured, app-agnostic incentives (DRIP) to attract usage and reinforce protocol alignment\n* Use analytics and reporting to increase visibility, optimize decision-making, and build external trust\n* Leverage relationships and special projects to scale adoption, reinforce values, and extend reach\n\nIn short, we stop throwing darts at the wall and start\u00a0**designing growth**: capital-efficient, data-informed, and strategically aligned.\n\nOur high-level objectives to achieve the above strategy are as follows, with more details in each deliverable section below:\n\n* Smooth handover to OpCo of DAO operations- and communications-related tasks, while filling the gaps in the interim as needed.\n* Maximize the number of dapps and RWAs that \u201ccall Arbitrum Home\u201d by designing treasury management and incentive programs that support BD efforts. Bolster this through data analytics support as a white glove services offering.\n* Formalize the DAO\u2019s financial processes, optimize and introduce revenue streams, ensure AEP licensing fees are paid and idle non-native assets are put to work in DeFi in accordance with portfolio management policies, and continually monitor key protocol revenue drivers like Timeboost and the transaction fee mechanism.\n* Professionalize and iterate on various areas within the Arbitrum DAO, such as the early-stage support funnel or data transparency, by altering their structures and implementing custom front ends.\n\n**Ultimately, our primary goal through 2027 is to make Arbitrum the leading tech stack for builders, institutions, innovators, and users alike; powered by a sustainable flywheel of compounding growth leading to value generation.**\n\n### Financial Planning, Analysis, and Guiding Capital Deployment\n\nEntropy will work closely with AAEs, vendors, and ecosystem teams to build out the DAO\u2019s core financial infrastructure. We believe that the long-term viability of the Arbitrum DAO hinges on prudent asset management, disciplined budgeting, and strategic cash flow deployment to generate additional income, compound growth, and deepen our ecosystem\u2019s liquidity while supporting integral builders. It\u2019s worth emphasizing that while we work on financially sound structures, growth will always be at the forefront of our work in the ecosystem.\n\nOur responsibilities here will include:\n\n* Tracking and consolidating key financial figures, including revenue sources (AEP Licensing Fees, Timeboost, Transaction Fees, Treasury Management activity, and others that may arise), the DAO\u2019s assets/liabilities, as well as realized expenses to set up and maintain in-depth financial statements.\n* Building models to project DAO financials and scenario-plan various budget configurations.\n* Providing recommendations for capital allocation, including ecosystem-growth targeting activities, income-generating initiatives, cost-cutting opportunities, and diversified treasury strategies.\n* Procuring service providers and conducting outreach to protocols for initiatives classified under the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council (GMC, TMC, STEP)\n* Supporting the DAO with real-time, bespoke financial dashboards, posting quarterly DAO financial reports to the forum, and ensuring the proper risk analysis measures are in place. This reporting will take place across all of the DAO\u2019s financial and asset-allocation activity, including the assets that currently fall under STEP, TMC, GMC, and other future initiatives.\n* Working cross-functionally with all of the AAEs to create aligned, sustainable cross-functional capital deployment plans across the DAO\u2019s initiatives.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to provide the DAO with the tools, data, and guidance necessary to fund innovation responsibly, while positioning Arbitrum to be financially self-sustaining over the coming years.\n\n### Incentives\n\nWe believe incentives will play a major role in Arbitrum\u2019s next phase of growth, especially given the increased attention on dapp performance and ecosystem competitiveness. Our team will build upon the groundwork laid in the DRIP proposal to establish a long-term incentives strategy.\n\nKey areas of focus:\n\n* Continue leading incentive design frameworks, being the main party responsible for the success of approved programs\n* Draft and refine incentive programs, ensuring data-driven optimization throughout the programs\u2019 lifecycle and that low-return programs are swiftly discontinued\n* Work with ecosystem teams (dApps, infra, new deployments) to scope incentive programs that accelerate high-growth opportunities sustainably.\n* Facilitate real-time data for the DAO to follow the progress of incentive programs, analyze the effectiveness of implemented programs, and deliver actionable feedback loops to improve upon them.\n* Interface with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure growth programs run by the aforementioned entities and the DAO are synergistic.\n\nEntropy\u2019s goal is to bring structure and discipline to a chaotic incentives landscape. We see ourselves as the party relentlessly focused on continuous iteration, eliminating inefficiencies, and driving outcomes.\n\n### Ecosystem Data\n\nWe plan to double down on our ecosystem data work, expanding the scope and sophistication of our analytics to support every aspect of DAO decision making, while also serving as a protocol support mechanism that endorses native builders and attracts new builders, with the added benefit of increasing the ecosystem\u2019s social presence. Both of the prior-listed roles around treasury management and incentives include analytics, but the data team will have an expanded scope outside of these 2 already time-intensive categories.\n\nKey priorities:\n\n* Continue building world-class dashboards and reports for delegates, investors, and DAO programs across all verticals.\n* Expand to more dapp-specific dashboards that showcase usage, traction, and ecosystem synergies in an effort to attract new protocols to Arbitrum while also supporting existing ones. These same efforts will apply to significant Orbit chain deployments.\n* Assist partners like OCL, the AF, and OpCo with analytics that track protocol upgrades, monitor the health of the network, and/or help track operational metrics. OCL, the AF, and other key stakeholders have already regularly reached out to Entropy for help with custom analytics, and we would love to continue this work.\n* Provide Entropy\u2019s data infrastructure as a core asset for both internal DAO operations and external ecosystem engagement. Ideally, this will have its own custom Arbitrum-branded front-end rather than simply living on Dune.\n* Support institutions (e.g., TradFi managers) with data services (e.g., analytics for managers\u2019 tokenized RWAs live on Arbitrum One) to strengthen the DAO\u2019s relationship with them and to help establish Arbitrum One as the prioritized destination for institutions\u2019 future initiatives.\n* Analytics around incentives and treasury management, outlined in prior sections of this proposal.\n* Handle ad hoc data needs as they arise. A concrete example of this includes our\u00a0[Security Council](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-security-council)\u00a0dashboard, which was created quickly to support the election process.\n\nBased on our experience, utilizing data services as a BD and support tool is an extremely powerful way to attract and entrench new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Providing these types of services is a valuable opportunity for Arbitrum to expand its brand reach and, as we\u2019ve observed, having the ability to offer white glove treatment increases the likelihood of capturing interest from top-tier institutions and builders. Having said that, these white glow services are highly time-consuming on average, and under no circumstances do we want to divert our teams\u2019 capacity away from facilitating initiatives that directly benefit the DAO without the certainty of conversion. Given these circumstances, there may be certain projects that are complementary to Arbitrum and are deemed as high potential for the ecosystem. In these cases, it may make sense to ramp up project-specific capacity and thus support the ecosystem both directly through ecosystem-focused efforts and indirectly through BD-related data services. In these scenarios, the Arbitrum Foundation will have the ability to waive Entropy\u2019s exclusivity on a case-by-case basis.\n\nEntropy Data will be the connective tissue that powers smarter treasury decisions, sharper incentives, and more compelling narratives, while serving as a support mechanism for builders, institutions, and partners entering the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Special Projects\n\nEntropy Advisors will continue to act as a neutral strategic arm and flexible generalist operator for the DAO, identifying high-impact and ad hoc initiatives that fall outside traditional workstreams or require a novel approach. These are the thorny, under-owned, cross-functional, and/or politically sensitive deliverables that the DAO may struggle to tackle without a coordinated, trusted group stepping in. In many cases, the OpCo will be best suited to pick up some of this work with regard to occasional operational requirements, but given Entropy\u2019s team composition, we may be best positioned for certain tasks based on our existing skillsets and relationships.\n\nExamples of special projects include:\n\n* Represent the Arbitrum DAO, when deemed appropriate by OCL or the AF, when dealing with external protocols that are considering deployments on the Arbitrum tech stack (similar to our involvement in the Ethena X Securitize deal to launch Converge on Orbit). Note that we\u2019ve acted in a similar role several times throughout our initial term.\n* Help educate traditional financial institutions, typically those who reach out with interest in STEP, on the shortcomings of current tokenized RWA designs and opportunities when it comes to ecosystem integrations, and offer our time and DeFi-nativity to inform upcoming product launches in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Work with relevant partners to enable DAO-owned products that can diversify the DAO\u2019s revenue streams in tandem with improving the user experience on Arbitrum.\n* Attend high-profile conferences and take on speaking opportunities to spread the Arbitrum brand. We will also continue to host \u201cdelegate days\u201d in an effort to align key stakeholders.\n* Iterate on Arbitrum DAO\u2019s early-stage support structure by bringing in talent and making it a more professional and cohesive experience that affords the DAO upside in the projects it helps get off the ground.\n* Miscellaneous projects as opportunities arise.\n\nWe will remain flexible in this vertical, focusing on initiatives that drive high strategic value but may lack an existing home within the DAO\u2019s organizational structure. It may be necessary to approve ideas that Entropy will take on via a DAO vote if these initiatives require excess budgets beyond what Entropy itself can afford.\n\n### Termination Clause and Transparency Pledge\n\nThe DAO naturally retains the option to terminate this agreement through a standard forum \u2192 Snapshot process, requiring 3% of the votable token supply to vote in favor of the termination. Quarterly transparency reports will be directly shared with the Arbitrum Foundation at their request, which will have the ability to move a forum post forward with the same structure for termination. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment from accruing at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked (but unearned) for Entropy Advisors\u2019 future base payments and the remaining funds of the 10M ARB set aside for incentive alignment will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation.\n\nOnce the OpCo has been sufficiently operationalized, Entropy Advisors will operate under the assumption that OpCo will be Entropy\u2019s counterparty that will represent the DAO and act as its proxy. Moreover, we will continue sharing monthly updates with the DAO.\n\n# Overall Costs\n\n## Budget\n\nAfter reaching out to some larger delegates and key stakeholders to get feedback on how Entropy Advisors should proceed forward, it has become clear that a 2-year term mandate is desired to ensure alignment over a sufficient period of time in order to accomplish the aforementioned goals. Therefore, we are proposing to work with the Arbitrum DAO for 2 years from September 1st 2025 through August 31st 2027. We propose a base pay of $3M per year, a ~$500k per year increase versus our first term, as we have ambitions to grow the team to internalize key functions related to data, incentives, and treasury management.\n\nIn addition to our base pay, and in an effort to achieve long-term alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem, we propose a 5M ARB allocation to Entropy Advisors that will be locked in a vesting contract with a 1-year cliff and 3-year vest. In addition to the 5M ARB allocation, 10M ARB will be set aside for the OAT to negotiate directly with Entropy Advisors on establishing short, medium, and long-term incentive mechanisms. These mechanisms may include, but not be limited to, milestone-based payments, an equity investment into Entropy Advisors, bonuses related to Entropy exceeding expectations, etc. The Arbitrum Foundation will custody this 10M ARB, and must adhere to any agreement made between the OAT and Entropy Advisors. It is also worth noting that any terms related to an equity investment may fall under NDA. Our goal is to ensure the entire Entropy Advisors team has a large incentive to see Arbitrum win, and to ensure we remain committed to Arbitrum significantly into the future. It is also our goal to ensure the Arbitrum DAO can hedge its exposure to Entropy Advisors and enjoy the benefits of its future growth.\n\nIn total, we are requesting the transfer of $6M in ARB (covering 2 years) + a 100% buffer + 15M ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation. $6M worth of ARB will be liquidated immediately upon the passing of this proposal on Tally. 5M ARB will be put into a vesting contract by the Arbitrum Foundation in accordance with the vest above and 10M ARB to remain in custody of the Foundation for the OAT / Entropy alignment mechanisms. The remainder of the funds will be returned to the DAO treasury immediately thereafter. The vesting contract cliff will begin on September 1, 2025, regardless of the timing the actual vesting contract is launched (backdated if needed).\n\nThe Entropy Team will be eligible to claim regular monthly payments of $250,000 from the Arbitrum Foundation throughout the 24-month term. Payments that have accrued can be claimed at any time. If the DAO passes a Snapshot to end its engagement with Entropy Advisors, it will be considered binding on the final day of the same month it passes, and Entropy will be ineligible to accrue any further payments.\n\nWe are nullifying the terms in our Year 1 engagement proposal that stipulate the DAO will vote on a bonus for the first year of our services, and instead replace it with this structure. The ARB allocated as a potential bonus that is in the AF\u2019s possession related to our first engagement should be repurposed at the Foundation\u2019s discretion to cover this engagement proposal, or be returned to the DAO treasury if not required to do so. It is also important to note that Entropy Advisors did not claim the full $205,834 monthly allotments from the first engagement proposal for the first 4 months of service, so the Arbitrum Foundation should have ~$423,336 of additional funds slated to be returned to the DAO. However, we propose allowing the Arbitrum Foundation to use these additional funds to cover a portion of Entropy\u2019s next 2 year engagement (assuming this proposal passes) to minimize ARB sales if it wishes to do so.\n\nEntropy will be abstaining from voting on this proposal due to a clear COI. We look forward to the opportunity of continuing our work in the Arbitrum DAO over the coming years. Entropy Advisors is all-in on Arbitrum, and we look forward to winning together.\n\n## Targeted Timeline\n\n* Forum Discussion: 2 weeks\n* Snapshot Period: 1 week\n* Pre-Tally Discussion: 1 week\n* Tally: ~3 weeks\n* If passed, 2nd mandate initiated: September 1, 2025"

    "description": "# GovHack at ETH CC (Brussels)\n# [](#hack-humanity-govhack-at-eth-cc-brussels-1)Hack Humanity: GovHack at ETH CC (Brussels)\n\n**non-constituional**\n\n## [](#abstract-2)Abstract\n\nHack Humanity is seeking $309k of funding from the Arbitrum DAO to host an event and after-party coinciding with [ETH CC](https://ethcc.io/) in Brussels, Belgium. Arbitrum GovHack Brussels will take place as a 3-day event on July 5, 6, and 7, the days directly prior to the start of the conference. ETH CC is only 11 weeks away, so approving the funds ASAP is of the utmost importance to ensure that Arbitrum has a strong presence at one of the most important Ethereum-centric events of the year.\n\nHack Humanity intends to continue serving the DAO by planning IRL activations and will seek additional funding in the coming months. The time constraints for ETH CC have led us to propose funding solely for this event in hopes of an expedient proposal process prior to asking the DAO for a larger funding package that ensures a long-term and optimal solution for Arbitrum DAO\u2019s event participation.\n\nGovHack Brussels aims to:\n\n* Build trust and deepen relationships between Arbitrum contributors\n* Ideate and later implement proposals that benefit Arbitrum\n* Attract new talent to the DAO\n* Position Arbitrum as the go-to home for talent to build and the DAO as a world-class operation maturing and innovating at the forefront of decentralized governance\n\nGovHack Brussels, improves on and expands GovHack ETHDenver with additional prize pool, the introduction of a subsidy pool for high-value contributors, enhancing and running a proper community showcase day, and adding a dedicated afterparty.\n\n## [](#motivation-3)Motivation\n\nIn a world of remote work, decentralized technology, and decentralized finance, the human social-layer needs intentional facilitation and development to mature and enable building this next paradigm of technology and new ways of working together. Online collaboration can only get us so far. A key competitive advantage for the ArbitrumDAO is strategically investing in growing a high-trust network of talented contributors, delegates, service providers, and builders on Arbitrum. GovHack ETHDenver proved the thesis that in-person opportunities for the DAO to work together represent a significant competitive advantage for Arbitrum.\n\n[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4fec995f9c5fa12ec06eacbfd88bd65104c776a9.jpeg)](https://pitch.com/v/arbitrum-govhack----ethdenver-v21-ngcy5r)\n\nIf you are aiming to learn more about what GovHack aims to achieve, please check out their ETHDenver:\n\n* [Pitch](https://pitch.com/v/arbitrum-govhack----ethdenver-v21-ngcy5r) deck\n* [Impact Report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/23239) - 9.1 star rating and 67% NPS from participants\n* [Media production](https://www.youtube.com/@HackHumanity/playlists)\n* Aftermovie:\n\n[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7b1a008f0826ef178f0fe33e5b6bd4d4920622e8.jpeg \"GovHack Aftermovie - ETHDenver 2024 - Powered by Hack Humanity\")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Bt-wQt8sE)\n\nHack Humanity, was previously funded with a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to host GovHack ETHDenver. Hack Humanity is looking to build on this success and momentum as an ecosystem development partner through IRL activations with the Arbitrum DAO for the long-term.\n\nIt is critical that Arbitrum has a significant presence at industry-leading events, and that contributors have regular and consistent IRL opportunities to grow high-trust relationships. It builds community and brand while attracting users, developers, and other important DAO contributors.\n\nHack Humanity offers deep custom work pre-event; with ecosystem mapping, facilitating community co-design processes to develop tracks & challenge statements most relevant to Arbitrum, identifying target talent contributor personas, skill gap analysis of who to market and recruit to the ecosystem. Hack Humanity drives innovation through unique custom IRL experiences that mature and evolve the DAO\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\\[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9ebed2c3a93253ad459e7b1876b8701e8bb16055_2_599x341.jpeg)\n\n1600\u00d7912 352 KB\n\n]\\(https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9ebed2c3a93253ad459e7b1876b8701e8bb16055.jpeg)\n\nA well-run event typically requires a minimum of 3 months of lead time, with factors such as securing suppliers, the team\u2019s calendar, and venue down payments requiring capital upfront from the event organizer. We are less than 90 days out from ETH CC, and at this point Arbitrum is not well-positioned to have a strong presence in Brussels. [Klaus](https://twitter.com/klausbrave) (Hack Humanity founder) has exemplified his ability to host high-quality IRL activations on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO in the past, so we believe that getting funds approved ASAP so that Hack Humanity can begin organizing a governance hackathon and an after-party is very important.\n\nRelevant Hack Humanity resources:\n\n* [Arbitrum GovHack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Bt-wQt8sE) Video (ETHDenver)\n  * GovHack ETH Denver [forum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-powered-by-hack-humanity/21119) proposal\n  * [Impact report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/23239)\n* [Klaus](https://twitter.com/klausbrave/)\u2019 work at [IBM](https://youtu.be/cMMkxZo89GQ)\n* Company [Website](https://www.hackhumanity.com/)\n  * [Hack Humanity Pitch Deck](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dqxabsyasoohpa4cyqh4y/Hack-Humanity-Human-Centred-Hackathons-v2024.pdf?rlkey=r0brje5hzkq8sxwryje6gbpc2\\&dl=0)\n* YouTube [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hackhumanity)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HackHumanityCo)\n\n## [](#rationale-4)Rationale\n\nThe most successful crypto brands, such as Uniswap, LayerZero, dYdX, and others, prioritize brand presence at events to reaffirm their positions as industry leaders. ETH CC is an Ethereum-focused event, and Arbitrum should lean into that given its status as the leading Ethereum L2. These events provide substantial value, such as brand strengthening, community building, attracting developer talent, in-person ideation, and more.\n\nMany hackathons cost north of $1M with smart contract base layers like Near, zkSync, Avalanche, and others throwing events/hackathons with more than 1000 participants. It\u2019s important Arbitrum remains competitive with these other protocols to ensure its ability to attract talent.\n\n## [](#specifications-5)Specifications\n\nGovHack will run for three days, boast a prize pool of $20k for GovHack participants, have t-shirts and other swag for attendees to get their hands on, and pre, mid, and post-event media production and storytelling to represent the voice of the DAO and to amplify the event on social platforms.\n\nGovHack is 3 events in 1: A 2-day hackathon-style bootcamp, followed by a 1-day Community Showcase, followed by an afterparty. Hack Humanity is looking to build on GovHack ETHDenver\u2019s success and coevolve with the DAO over the long term.\n\n**For GovHack Brussels a full impact report and transparency around the event and its cost will be posted in the forum following its completion.**\n\n## [](#steps-to-implement-6)Steps to Implement\n\nOnce spending is approved by the DAO, funds will be sent to a \u2154 multisig to be converted into dollars. These dollars will be used to pay for the costs associated with running and organizing the event. Hack Humanity will provide event details on the forum so that the entire community can participate in the event\u2019s scope and execution.\n\n50% of the funds will be paid to Hack Humanity upon this proposal\u2019s approval. An additional 35% will be disbursed the week before the event, and the final 15% will be disbursed after the event concludes.\n\nThe 3 multisig signers will be: Klaus + Abdullah Umar (Arana Digital) + Krzysztof Urba\u0144ski\nThe multisig address is (arb1) 0x03D47B06Cc95bAFf2a408cD7c735ed7e7142Edb9\n\n**Any excess funds from the $309k that are not spent on the Brussels event will be rolled over and used to fund future Arbitrum events, but only if the DAO votes to spend additional funds on future events before the end of August. If the DAO votes against further spending on events, or a proposal fails to pass by the end of August, the excess ARB will be returned to the DAO.**\n\n## [](#timeline-7)Timeline\n\nThe event will take place July 5, 6, and 7 (2024) in Brussels, Belgium directly before ETH CC. Given the strict timeline, we are hoping to proceed to Snapshot on Wednesday, April 24th (if delegates approve), in order to hopefully have funds earmarked by the end of May.\n\nMore details will be shared with the DAO in the weeks leading up to the event surrounding the specifics of GovHack.\n\n\\[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/42a260b615c30651c8298cc735e633da0d719008_2_187x465.png)\n\n502\u00d71246 40 KB\n\n]\\(https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/42a260b615c30651c8298cc735e633da0d719008.png)\n\nWith the expedited process as outlined, Hack Humanity will only have a ~5 week buffer to plan the event. It is paramount that if the DAO wants representation at ETH CC, we move with haste.\n\n## [](#overall-cost-8)Overall Cost\n\nBrussels is an expensive European city, and successfully executing a world-class high-quality IRL activation requires a significant budget.\n\nThe event\u2019s research, preparation and delivery phase determines the exact event program design, local costs, the number of participants, any scholarships/stipends, etc. Getting the funds approved is the top priority so that Hack Humanity can begin to work out these details.\n\nThe all-in cost to execute this proposal is expected to be $309k, with a rough budget broken down in the following table:\n\nItem\n\nCost\n\nVenue, Food, Drink, Swag, room equipment, interior decor, printing, stationery\n\n$85,000\n\nMarketing, targeted contributor outreach, Pre/Post Event Media Production, AV equipment rental, hackathon management software and other licensing\n\n$33,000\n\nHackathon Prize Pool\n\n$20,000\n\nScholarships\n\n$10,000\n\nAfter-party + Contingency\n\n$50,000\n\nOn-site living costs (5 days, lead in, lead out day + 3 delivery days for a team of 7): Flights, Accommodation, Ubers, Food\n\n$13,000\n\nHack Humanity margin and fees. GovHack Director and assistant to design, organize, deliver the event. Designer, local Brussels event producer advisory, on-site GovHack delivery team (7). Post-event Impact Report, community engagement, handover.\n\n$98,000\n\n**Total Cost**:\n\n**$309,000**\n\n**Any excess funds from the $309k that are not spent on the Brussels event will be rolled over and used to fund future Arbitrum events, but only if the DAO votes to spend additional funds on future events before the end of August. If the DAO votes against further spending on events, or a proposal fails to pass by the end of August, the excess ARB will be returned to the DAO.**\n\nThe amount of ARB to be moved to the multisig will be determined in accordance with the dollar equivalent of the trailing 14D ARB TWAP with a 30% buffer. **After the ARB is swapped to USDC, any amount in excess of $309k will be immediately back to the DAO.**\n\nThe scope of this proposal to the DAO is specifically for ETH CC in Brussels. Hack Humanity intends to produce a subsequent proposal to provide a year-round program of events on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO, this will require a larger funding package, with a component to cover a full-time team & and a component for an event budget to cover a series of IRL events. Hack Humanity needs the ability to hire and maintain a dedicated team committed to Arbitrum, this uniquely enables high-context, up to date and relevant continual program design in lockstep with the needs of Arbitrum\u2019s roadmap and community needs, it also enables Hack Humanity and team to commit and block calendar dates for future events 6-12 months in advance, secure venues, and team member\u2019s time. This requires upfront funding.\n\nExpect another proposal for further funding in the coming months. We need this GovHack Brussels proposal to be executed swiftly so that the event in Brussels can be organized as soon as possible, hence our decision to seek funding only for this event rather than trying to pass a larger DAO spend."

    "description": "# Enhancing Multichain Governance: Upgrading RARI Governance Token on Arbitrum\n## [](#p-55784-abstract-1)Abstract\n\nThe RARI DAO seeks to enhance its governance framework by upgrading the RARI token contract and bringing its governance from Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal requests to regirster a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract via Arbitrum native bridge, as only the Arbitrum DAO can implement this change. The custom gateway will enable more efficient governance processes with the upgraded token, reduce user costs, and improve overall accessibility for RARI DAO.\n\n## [](#p-55784-motivation-2)Motivation\n\nRARI DAO is governed by the $RARI token, which when locked in veRARI grants voting access. The current token contract is on Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradable. The RARI DAO wishes to upgrade its governance, a part of which is a token contract upgrade with snapshots and delegations embedded. Only the Arbitrum DAO can however set up the mapping of L1 \u2192 L2 token addresses in the custom gateway (which is controlled by Arbitrum DAO) on the Arbitrum native bridge. Here is more information about the topic: [ERC-20 token bridging | Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway)\n\n## [](#p-55784-rationale-3)Rationale\n\nThe RARI DAO multichain governance upgrade is designed to make governance more accessible, by simplifying the UX, reducing gas fees, and enabling new token functions. This aligns with Artbitrum\u2019s commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.\n\nWith a custom L2 token implementation we will be able to perform the RARI DAO governance upgrade and move our governance fully into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## [](#p-55784-key-terms-4)Key Terms\n\nRARI token: RARI DAO governance token ([$1.95 | Rarible (RARI) Token Tracker | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf)\n\nRARI DAO: body governing the Rarible Protocol and RARI chain\n\nCustom L2 RARI token: upgraded and simplified RARI token to be used in RARI DAO multichain governance moving forward\n\n## [](#p-55784-specifications-5)Specifications\n\nRARI token in question ([$1.95 | Rarible (RARI) Token Tracker | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf)) does not have upgradability nor allows the owner to register in the Arbitrum token bridge router.\n\nAs such, we\u2019re requesting a custom L2 token implementation and using the (standard) custom gateway. Lacking the ability to upgrade / owner-register, we are seeking Artbirum DAO\u2019s approval to register the upgraded RARI token to the custom gateway so we can proceed with the custom L2 implementation.\n\n**The upgraded token contract was fully audited and can be found here:** [https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305)**.**\n\nToken contract was deployed first in tetnests and then to Arbitrum One, and RARI chain (which is on top of Arbitrum One). All contracts were tested manually as well.\n\nRARI DAO voted in favor of the upgraded token: [Tally | Rari DAO | RRC 30 - Enhancing RARI DAO Governance: Plan for upgrade](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588)\n\nThe executable code to create the custom gateway was prepared by Offchain Labs and can be found [HERE](https://arbitrum.notion.site/Public-Rari-Token-Register-Executable-3914a05c5bf94323a3d0d88abcc6576b?pvs=25).\nThe code was fully audited by Trail of Bits: [https://rari-foundation.notion.site/Trail-of-Bits-Audit-for-Arbitrum-Native-Bridge-Custom-Pathway-1124e8bfb53f8017842cf3b94cf8045b](https://rari-foundation.notion.site/Trail-of-Bits-Audit-for-Arbitrum-Native-Bridge-Custom-Pathway-1124e8bfb53f8017842cf3b94cf8045b)\n\n\n\n## [](#p-55784-steps-to-implement-6)Steps to Implement\n\n1. Deploy token contracts on Arbitrum and RARI chains (done)\n2. Security audit of the proposed code change (done)\n3. Change mapping for L1 \u2192 L2 tokens on bridge router and custom gateway (This can be done only by Arbitrum DAO)\n\n## [](#p-55784-timeline-7)Timeline\n\nImplementation upon the proposal\u2019s execution.\n\n## [](#p-55784-overall-costs-8)Overall costs\n\nN/A"

    "description": "# Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process\n## Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis Constitutional AIP proposes improvements to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and the Security Council election process, which include:\n\n* Candidates are given a week to apply for a Security Council position before the nominee selection stage takes place.\n* Candidates need to sign a transaction from their EOA (Externally Owned Account) to apply for a Security Council position.\n* The ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to reflect these changes as well as correct previous mistakes in wording with regard to timing and quorum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis AIP aims to improve the election process ensuring that candidates are not overlooked during the nominee selection stage and that candidates stand an equal chance of being nominated to the following stage of the election process, irrespective of when in the registration period they express their interest. It also updates the system so contenders must provide a signed message before running in the elections - this ensures they are able to produce signed messages for the different chains that the Security Council needs the ability to act on.\n\nIssues with the current Security Council election process:\n\n* In the nominee Selection stage, because contender registration and endorsement occur in the same 7-day period, delegates are likely to overlook applications that are submitted at the end of the period. This results in candidates who submit their applications at the start of the period having an unfair advantage, as they are more likely to be endorsed and therefore progress to the next stage.\n* Candidates might sign up to the elections using an on-chain smart contract wallet which is not able to produce signatures valid for other ArbitrumDAO-governed chains.\n* The constitution does not clearly express the election procedure.\n\n## Specifications\n\nAccordingly, this AIP aims to implement the following changes:\n\n1. A 7-day \u2018Contender Submission\u2019 stage before the \u2018Nominee Selection\u2019 stage. Accordingly, the duration of the entire election process will increase from 42 days to 49 days.\n2. For candidates to apply for a Security Council position, they are required to provide a signed message from their wallet.\n3. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to correctly reflect how quorum for proposals (as well as the election process) is handled, which should also take into account \u2018abstain\u2019 votes.\n4. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to reflect the new format of the Security Council elections.\n\nThe code representing the proposed changes is final and available for full review in:\u00a0[https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/231\u00a07](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/231)\u00a0and\u00a0[https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/docs/pull/731\u00a02](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/docs/pull/731)\n\nThe Governance Action contract was deployed and is available for review in\u00a0[NomineeGovernorV2UpgradeAction | Address 0xd9a2e0e5d7509f0bf1b2d33884f8c1b4d4490879 | Arbiscan\u00a07](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd9a2e0e5d7509f0bf1b2d33884f8c1b4d4490879#code)"

    "description": "# AIP: ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d - Arbitrum Support for Dencun + Batch Poster Improvements \n# Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including the capability to leverage EIP 4844 to post batches of L2 transactions as Blobs on L1 Ethereum at a cheaper price. The proposal also includes support for most of the changes included in [Ethereum's Dencun upgrade](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7569) and 2 improvements to batch posting for Arbitrum One and Nova. The proposed ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d upgrade will be ready for adoption by any Arbitrum Chain; this proposal concerns the Arbitrum One and Nova chains, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum\u2019s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject over in [Arbitrum ArbOs upgrades](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\nThis AIP combines following two temperature checks: [AIP: ArbOS Version 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x813a366e287a872ada13d4f8348e771c7aa2d8c3cb00b2be31539ceab5627513) and [AIP: Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbecc45a6beb55a708e25195f34db2f5ff757e0da5ff55171ca731b39428e27c3) - both of which have passed.\n\nPlease note that ArbOS Version 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d is an upgrade that builds upon [ArbOS version 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-11/19696/) which has been adopted by the ArbitrumDAO - this proposal increments the version number to 20 instead of 12 due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability.\n\n# Changes Included\n\n## 1. Posting batches of transactions as blobs to L1 Ethereum ([EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844))\n\nWith ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d, any Arbitrum chain that settles on L1 Ethereum will be able to post transactions as either calldata or \u201cblob-data\u201d - the latter of which is to be introduced in EIP-4844 as part of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade.\n\nSome notes on how this is implemented for Arbitrum:\n\n* Applications on Arbitrum will not have to be modified or take any explicit action to get the benefits of using EIP-4844 (i.e. the whole chain opts-in with ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d).\n* ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d adds support for Arbitrum chains to send data in a blob storage format to data availability layers, like L1 Ethereum, that support the blob transaction type. This includes Arbitrum One and Nova. ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d does not add support for Arbitrum chains to *receive* data in a blob storage format. This means that any L3 Orbit chain settling to an L2 Arbitrum chain will post data to the underlying L2 Arbitrum chain as calldata. The L2 Arbitrum chain will then be able to post data to a L1 data availability layer like Ethereum using blobs.\n* There currently aren't estimates on what the end-user gas savings of using blob data will be yet. This topic is something being actively worked on and monitored. Without mainnet data, the estimates for blob gas prices will not be accurate enough to reliably predict the cost reductions that users will experience - and even with mainnet data, the savings will vary by use case (i.e. no current way to predict the price impacts from all blob gas market participants yet). In general, however, the use of blobs will generally reduce the cost of using Arbitrum L2s.\n\nThis AIP includes a number of upgrades that enable Arbitrum chains to utilize EIP-4844:\n\n* Updated Sequencer Inbox contract with new methods allowing the Sequencer to post Arbitrum transactions in blob data.\n* Updates to the OneStepProof (OSP) contract to support the new Nitro fraud prover (mentioned above), along with a small patch to the ChallengeManager contract to allow changing the OSP.\n* Update to the Nitro fraud prover to support proving additional hashes, i.e., KZG and SHA256 preimages.\n* Update to the core Nitro node software to handle parsing chain data from 4844 blobs.\n\n**Nitro core changes:**\n\nCurrent full code diff can be viewed via this link: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/compare/consensus-v11...finalize-arbos-20>.

Enable partial support for Dencun Execution Layer\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade is technically a combination of two upgrades: one to the Execution Layer and another to the Consensus Layer, named Cancun and Deneb, respectively. While the Consensus Layer upgrades are not applicable to Nitro (since Nitro is Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova\u2019s execution engine), some of the Execution Layer changes are, including [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153) as described above. The full Cancun network upgrade specification for Ethereum can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/1fed0c0074f9d6aab3861057e1924411948dc50b/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/cancun.md).\n\nNitro\u2019s upgrade to ArbOS 20 adds support for three specific EIPs from Cancun, those being:\n\n* Support the new transient storage EVM opcodes introduced in [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153): `TSTORE` and `TLOAD`, offering a cheaper option than storage for data that\u2019s discarded at the end of a transaction.\n* Support the new `MCOPY` EVM opcode introduced in [EIP-5656](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656) for cheaper memory copying.\n* Support the changes in functionality of the`SELFDESTRUCT` EVM opcode, as outlined in [EIP-6780](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780).\n\nSince Nitro uses [Geth at the Core](https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#geth-at-the-core), the above 3 EIPs were implemented by merging in a Cancun-supported version of Geth upstream. More specifically, [Geth version 1.13.1](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.13.3) was merged into Nitro\u2019s go-ethereum fork here:\n\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/284>\n\nWith the above merged, the below PR is used to enable the Cancun fork in ArbOS 20.\n\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/285>\n\n## 3. Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**Batch Poster Manager:**\n\nCurrently, both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, each have a single address that is granted the batch-poster role (this is currently the same as the Sequencer). The Sequencer posts batches frequently, and thus the batch-poster address must be controlled by a hot wallet. This means that if the batch poster\u2019s keys were compromised, Sequencing could be unstable until the DAO took action.\n\nThis AIP proposes a system in which a \u201cbatch poster manager\u201d role is granted to the operator of the Sequencer which has the ability to grant and revoke batch-posting affordances. This way, the batch poster manager could perform key rotations for the batch posters\u2014 routinely, and/or if a batch poster address is ever compromised \u2014 quickly and without the DAO needing to take coordinated action. Note that this proposal does not change the sequencer, but more so allow for easier key rotations on the batch poster.\n\nCrucially, this would not represent a change on the current system\u2019s trust model:\n\n* In both the current and the new proposed system, the Sequencer is entrusted with managing the batch posting affordance; in the current system, for example, the entity behind Sequencer could technically grant batch posting to an additional entity by simply sharing it\u2019s keys.\n* In the new system, the DAO would\u00a0*still*\u00a0have the same ability to revoke the Sequencer role; i.e., the DAO could update the batch poster manager (along with any batch posters).\n\nPR: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/commit/c7554852a7c41ca5eaef298dab10472a7f550df7>\n\n**MaxTimeVariation:**\n\nThe futureBlocks value in the the SequencerInbox enforces a max block height that a batch can be posted relative to the current block (likewise with futureSeconds). The current value for futureBlocks is 12, which was set prior to the Ethereum merge. A small value for future blocks means that a relatively small L1 reorg can cause an otherwise valid batch to revert. This proposal increases the value to 64, two epochs, in line with Ethereum\u2019s finality guarantees.\n\nPR: <https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/233>\n\n### Dencun changes *not* included in ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade includes various proposals that impact both the execution layer and the consensus layer, as mentioned earlier. Among the execution layer changes, there are two EIPs that are explicitly not included in ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d. This section briefly covers the scope of the two excluded EIPs and a rationale for why they are not included in ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d.\n\n* [**EIP-7516**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7516)**:** `BLOBBASEFEE` **opcode**\n\nThis EIP adds a new opcode to the EVM that returns the base fee of the current blob and is identical to the `BASEFEE` opcode introduced in [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198). This is applicable for Ethereum because it enables blob data users, such as rollup contracts or infrastructure, to programmatically account for the blob gas price.\n\nThis opcode is excluded from ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d because Arbitrum chains are not currently planned to support *receiving* blobs from other chains, like an L3 Orbit chain. Calls to the `BLOBBASEFEE` opcode on Arbitrum One and Nova after the ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d upgrade will revert.\n\n* [**EIP-4788**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788)**: Beacon block root in the EVM**\n\nThis EIP commits a given block\u2019s beacon chain root to the payload header for that particular block as a hash - essentially exposing beacon chain roots to the EVM. This is applicable for Ethereum because it improves the trust assumptions for a variety of applications that rely on data in the consensus layer. Examples of use cases that this would benefit include: staking pool, restaking constructions, smart contract bridges, and more.\n\nThis EIP is excluded from ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d because Arbitrum\u2019s execution engine (i.e. Nitro) does not have a consensus layer and relies on Ethereum consensus for data security and data finality. Calls to the beacon root opcode on Arbitrum One and Nova after the ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d upgrade will revert.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe canonical version of ArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash `cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749` and can be viewed in <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/commit/cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749>.\n\nArbOS 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d will be shipped as part of a future release of Nitro.\n\nSpecifically for the batch poster manager changes, the difference can be found here: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/commit/c7554852a7c41ca5eaef298dab10472a7f550df7>\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in <https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/244>.\n\nAction contract deployments:\n\n* 4844 + ArbOS20 (L1, for Arb One): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x76d8e97cd4514bebbc21d2044ff4a8d9ea1f0cc4>\n* 4844 + ArbOS20 (L1, for Nova): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x874356173cfd6c739aeab1f5abfb5f3afb3d4d33>\n* ArbOS 20: (Arb One): <https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3e313eeed58e851ca3841c6109697b9eb35c7726>\n* ArbOS 20: (Nova): <https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x3e313eeed58e851ca3841c6109697b9eb35c7726>\n* MaxTimeVariation (L1, for Arb One): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e313eeed58e851ca3841c6109697b9eb35c7726>\n* MaxTimeVariation (L1, for Nova): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x47a85c0a118127f3968a6a1a61e2a326517540d4>\n* Batch poster manager (L1, for Arb One): <https://etherscan.io/address/0xce0af261eb511cb41b8d0a2e31df80ba37e265ab>\n* Batch poster manager (L1, for Nova): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x501f30810d2b0eaec15cc3785dbb29e4a8a92a70>\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference\n\nThe current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 11, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v11`git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x8b104a2e80ac6165dc58b9048de12f301d70b02a0ab51396c22b4b4b802a16a4`, which is what the rollup contract\u2019s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo audit the code difference from ArbOS 11 to ArbOS 20, you could simply generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn\u2019t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 11 or ArbOS 20 with bash:\n\n\\#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\nmkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output\n\\# this script should be run in the nitro repository\ngit checkout cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake .make/solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt\ngit checkout consensus-v11\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake .make/solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v11-nitro-files.txt\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v10-geth-files.txt\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v11-nitro-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt > ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v11-geth-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt | sed 's@^\\[./]\\*go-ethereum/@@' > ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt\n\nNow, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 11 or ArbOS 20. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\ngit diff consensus-v11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)\n\nThe fraud prover is not part of the on-chain upgrade, but may be helpful in understanding the fraud proving smart contract changes and other components:\n\ngit diff consensus-11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 -- arbitrator/prover arbitrator/wasm-libraries/ arbitrator/arbutil ':!\\*\\*/Cargo.lock' ':!\\*\\*/kzg-trusted-setup.json'\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 11 and 20 used:\n\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v11 go-ethereum\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum\n$ git ls-tree cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 go-ethereum\n160000 commit 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6  go-ethereum\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n\\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.11.6 and v1.13.3, as ArbOS 11 used the former and ArbOS 20 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: [Git diff intersection finder](https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf)\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 20\u2019s go-ethereum against ArbOS 11\u2019s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 20\u2019s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.13.3:\n\n\\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-20-geth.diff\ngit diff v1.13.3 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-upstream-geth.diff\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-20-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-upstream-geth.diff --ignore-files 'core/blockchain\\*.go' arbitrum\\_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/\\*\\*' 'rpc/\\*\\*'\n\nThe above command ignores files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used with these arguments: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`. To also review those diffs, you can remove those arguments.\n\nNote that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag."

    "description": "# AIP 6: Security Council Elections Proposed Implementation Spec\nDisclaimer:\nThis proposal and the attached executable were created by the Arbitrum Foundation\n\n# **Security Council Elections**\n\n## **Category: Constitutional - Process**\n\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n* [Section 3 of the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-3-the-security-council) describes this council in more detail.\n* [Initial Setup Transparency Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup) details the current members of the council.\n* [Section 4 on the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections) outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\n\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\n### **Executive summary**\n* This vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\n* A smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and has undergone multiple security audits.\n* This vote is meant to enable the smart contract system that will allow for the elections, as well as temperature check with the DAO.\n* A successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader [Arbitrum governanc architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/4f0714cf3651a9ebcddd5bb05b2f841314845c34/docs/overview.md).\n\n### **Implementation Status**\n\nThe code representing the proposed architecture is final and available for full review in:\nhttps://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/commit/46dd56f55f4e0d96548fb6546122d47623c7a804.\n\nThe work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched, the full audit report is available [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/6413778294037033c56a25f32ef766c302544a9b/audits/trail_of_bits_sec_council_elections_report_8_9_2023.pdf).\n\nA Code4Rena audit competition has also been completed for the election system.\n\n# **Background**\n\nAn overview of the election process as described by the Constitution\nalongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum's smart\ncontract suite:\n* [Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) (esp. sections [3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-3-the-security-council) and [4](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections)) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.\n* [DAO Governance Architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md) - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.\n\nAn understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the\nreader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:\n* [Open Zeppelin Governor](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-security-council-elections-proposed-implementation-spec/15425) - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.\n* [Gnosis Modules](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-docs/blob/e5a669fa66a32aa4fc2ef84b219bc836e9328f6b/safe-core-protocol/plugins.md) - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.\n\n# **High-level Election Overview**\n\nThe Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to [the specification laid out in the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections), is split into:\n* Election stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\n* Update stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\n### **Election Stages**\n\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\n1.  Nominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\n2.  Compliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\n3.  Member election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\n\n### **Update Stages**\n\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\n1.  Security Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\n2.  L2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\n3.  Individual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\n\n\n# **Election Stages in detail**\n\n## **1. Nominee selection (7 days)**\n\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration,\ncandidate endorsement:\n* Election creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\n* Candidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\n* Endorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\n* Fallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n* Custom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\n\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n* A new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\n* Candidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.* Delegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n\n## **2. Compliance check by the Foundation (14 days)**\n\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organization being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n* Calling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n* Anyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\n\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n## **3. Member election (21 days)**\n\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n* 0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n* 7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\n\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n* Split voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate\nSecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit\nfrom Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can\ntrigger a new member election:\n* Call the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\n\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n* A custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\n* These additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\n* The custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\n\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n* Anyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\n\n# **Update stages in detail**\n\n## **1. Security Council manager update**\n\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n* Remove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\n* Add a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\n* Address rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n## **2. Timelocks and withdrawal**\n\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n* L2 timelock (3 days),\n* L2 \u2192 L1 withdrawal (\\~7 days),\n* L1 timelock (3 days).\n\nYou can read more about these stages in the [governance docs](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#proposal-delays). The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n## **3. Individual council updates**\n\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis\nsafes:\n* Arbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\n* Arbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\n* Ethereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\n* Nova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\n\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will\nreplace them.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nTo do this the existing [Upgrade Executor contracts](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#l1-upgrade-executor) on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom [Governance Action\nContract](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/src/gov-action-contracts/README.md) will be used to call the specific OwnerManager `addOwnerWithThreshold` and\nremoveOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\n## **Additional affordances**\n\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\n1.  The DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favor and 5/6 of cast votes are in favor. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\n2.  The Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\n3.  The Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\n\n## **Constitution Updates**\n\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution's text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\n### **Update timeline for the election**\n\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n* From T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n* From T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n* At T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n* **New timeline.** A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\n* **Less than 6 eligible nominees.** The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\n* **Installation time.** We need to remove the phrase 'immediately join the Council' to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user's right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 -\\L1 message.\n\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the\nConstitution with the following text:\n* **Nominee selection (T until T+7 days):** Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n* **Compliance process (T+7 until T+21 days):** All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n* **Member election (T+21 until T+42 days):** Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n* **At T+42 days:** The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n### **Compliance checks by the foundation.**\n\nThe Constitution contains the text:\n* \"Prior to the next Security Council election, The Arbitrum Foundation shall establish and set forth more detailed procedures and guidelines regarding the election process for the Security Council, which may include, but aren't limited to, a candidate intake process in order to comply with Cayman Islands laws, a standard template for candidates to complete for purposes of their public nominations and other processes to ensure an orderly, fair and transparent election.\"\n\nThe text gives an affordance to the Foundation to conduct a compliance check on the potential nominees. We propose to make this check an explicit stage of 14 days between Nominee Selection and Member Election to allow the Foundation to conduct these checks. Details of compliance checks will be provided by the Arbitrum Foundation at a later date.\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n* The Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\n\n**Security Council cannot re-appoint a member who was removed by the DAO.\n**\nThe Constitution contains the text:\n* The seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election.\n\nThe text focuses on how to replace a security council member who was removed by a vote from the DAO or 9/12 of the current security council members. We plan to update the Constitution to remove an edge-case that allows the Security Council to re-appoint a member who was removed by a DAO vote.\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n* The seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election. The Security Council may not re-appoint a member removed and they must be re-elected via the election voting system.\n\n### **Final update to the Constitution text.**\n\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the \\'First Cohort\\' and 6 members in the \\'Second Cohort\\'. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmcny9xqHG9s9HduycwpooW4sV9VUMxYtVwU2eBts7vyYq).\n\nThe first Security Council election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date. The election can only begin upon the availability of an on-chain election process that is approved and installed by the Arbitrum DAO. This first election replaces the \\'First Cohort\\'. The next election replaces the \\'Second Cohort\\' and so forth.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has started and it will replace its respective cohort of 6 members.\n\nAll Security Council members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council members are installed.\n\nThe following timeline governs an election that starts at time T:\n\n1.  **Nominee selection (T until T+7 days):** Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n2.  **Compliance process (T+7 until T+21 days):** All candidates will cooperate with the Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n3.  **Member election (T+21 until T+42 days):** Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+21 days and T+35 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+21 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n4.  **At T+42 days:** The process for replacing the cohort of security council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new security council members are installed.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The\nArbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\n\nAs a matter of best practice for maintaining an independent Security Council, no single organization should be overly represented in the Security Council. In particular, there should not be more than 3 candidates associated with a single entity or group of entities being elected to the Security Council, thereby ensuring that there will be no single entity or group of entities able to control or even veto a Security Council vote.\n\nFurthermore, no candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO, Governed Chains and/or The Arbitrum Foundation should be elected to the Security Council. Potential conflicts of interest could be, but are not limited to, affiliations with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others.\n\nThe DAO may approve and implement a Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future Security Council elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.\n\nSecurity Council members may only be removed prior to the end of their\nterms under two conditions:\n\n1.  At least 10% of all Votable Tokens have casted votes \\\"in favor\\\" of removal and at least 5/6 (83.33%) of all casted votes are \\\"in favor\\\" of removal; or\n2.  At least 9 of the Security Council members vote in favor of removal.\n\nThe seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election. The Security Council may not re-appoint a removed member and they can only be re-elected via the election voting system."

    "description": "# [UPDATED] Proposal to Establish the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\n**Amendments in light of community feedback:**\n\n* Standard 50,000ARB for the DAOAdvocate role due to the important nature of the role re. the ARDC.\n\n**Abstract**\u00a0- This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members\u2019 ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation**\u00a0- The ARDC\u2019s role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale**\u00a0- the ARDC\u2019s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\u00a0- Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded,\u00a0[@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer)\u00a0will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\n**Specifications & Timeline**\u00a0- Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost**\u00a0- Fund the ARDC with 1.715 Million ARB + Multi-Sig Budget for a 6-Month Term.\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n* 665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n* 5,000 ARB per month - Multi-Sig members\n* 16.0000 ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised as a result of the elected members and their corresponding fees will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining \u2018Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\u2019 or \u2018ARDC\u2019: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members\u2019 ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition\u00a011](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot\u00a07](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC\u2019s mandate will naturally aid in \u2018Governance Optimization\u2019 through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC\u2019s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition\u2019s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO\u2019s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC\u2019s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe\u00a0***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC\u2019s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate\u2019s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem\u2019s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024\u00d7768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF:\u00a0[The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs\u00a03](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member\u2019s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC\u2019s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC\u2019S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it\u2019s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC\u2019s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC\u2019s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.\n* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC\u2019s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums."

    "description": "# Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee\n**Abstract**\u00a0- The ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is tasked with facilitating & administering various procurement frameworks within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, creating new procurement frameworks for DAO Ratification & creating a proposal for security-service subsidies.\n\n**Motivation**\u00a0- Implementing the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) and its associated frameworks is essential for the Arbitrum community as it ensures a transparent, efficient, and accountable approach to procurement, benefiting the ecosystem by securing high-quality service providers via a preemptive quality assurance mechanism which is the procurement framework.\n\n**Rationale**\u00a0- the ADPC will play a pivotal role in achieving further organization within the ArbitrumDAO. The mandate of the ADPC aims to create an optimal organizational framework for service procurement while also creating a marketplace for service providers that would have gone through preemptive quality assurance.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\u00a0- The AIP passed Snapshot on the 9th of January 2024. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP is now proceeding to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the ADPC. Once the forecited steps are concluded the election process will commence.\n\nSpecifications & Timeline - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost**\u00a0- For a 6-month term, $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month) & 1,000ARB per Multi-sig member \\[per month]\n\n**The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be 200,000ARB (a buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC Multi-sig is still able to satisfy payments to procurement committee members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury)**\n\n***\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\nTL;DR\n\n* The ADPC (ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee) has the immediate mandate of overseeing the \u2018Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers\u2019 recently ratified by the ArbitrumDAO.\n* The ADPC may add additional procurement frameworks that will be ratified through Snapshot.\n* The committee will research and propose a subsidy fund for security-oriented services within the Arbitrum Ecosystem. A \u2018Means Test\u2019 will be implemented to determine project eligibility for security service-fee subsidies.\n* The ADPC will establish procurement frameworks for various verticals and service types within the ArbitrumDAO.\n* Three members will be elected to the ADPC through Snapshot\u2019s weighted voting system.\n* Eligibility criteria for members include experience, integrity, conflicts of interest disclosure, industry knowledge, analytical skills, financial acumen, communication skills, negotiation skills, project management abilities, ethical conduct, teamwork, technology proficiency, and decision-making skills.\n* The election process involves application submission, KYC/KYB review, and member election via Snapshot.\n* The ADPC\u2019s term is 6 months, with a monthly stipend of $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month)\n* Operational parameters include meeting minutes, monthly reports, bi-weekly calls, and a public dashboard.\n* The ADPC\u2019s Multi-Sig will be a 3/5 with signers receiving 1,000 ARB per month for their services. Signers cannot be Procurement Committee members.\n* Streaming of funds and clawback capabilities are implemented for multisig accountability.\n* The ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* The Agreement will cover appointment, conflict of interest, mandate, record-keeping, duty of impartiality, recusal, self-dealing prohibition, and ethical trading standards for ADPC members.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis proposal intends to formalize a structured group within the ArbitrumDAO (the \u2018ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee\u2019 or \u2018ADPC\u2019) responsible for overseeing and managing Procurement Frameworks that are ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time depending on the needs of the organization. The ADPC\u2019s primary purpose is to ensure that procurement activities are conducted efficiently, transparently, and in compliance with the applicable framework/s.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe ADPC\u2019s immediate mandate will be that of facilitating & administering the recently ratified \u2018Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers\u2019 \\[REF:[Proposal \\[Non-Constitutional\\]: \\*\\*Procurement Framework \\[Security Service Providers\\]\\*\\*\u00a015](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-procurement-framework-security-service-providers/19704)\u00a0&\u00a0[Snapshot\u00a011](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. This mandate can be supplemented by virtue of a Snapshot vote whereby the ArbitrumDAO may add another procurement framework that the Procurement Committee will be responsible to administer & facilitate.\n\nComposition of the ADPC \\[Mandate, Eligibility, Election Process, Funding, Operational Parameters]\n\n**\\[i] MANDATE**\n\n1. The primary mandate of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is to oversee and facilitate the recently ratified procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, as per the following reference: \\[Snapshot Proposal Link:\u00a0[Snapshot\u00a011](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.\n2. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n3. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & implementing a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized so as to assess a project\u2019s eligibility for the \u2018Subsidy Fund\u2019 referred to in point \\[b] above. This \u2018Means Test\u2019 (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in \\[b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.\n4. The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.\n5. The ADPC will be tasked with creating & communicating guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes & circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.\n\n**Steps \\[2], \\[3] & \\[4] of the mandate will necessarily have to be coupled with a 14-day consultation period pre-structuring so that input is solicit from the ArbitrumDAO and other relevant third-parties. The input collated during the public consultation period will necessarily need to be made public.**\n\nThe ADPC will be composed of three \\[3] members that will facilitate & administer procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The appointment of ADPC members will be effected via an open election process via Snapshot\u2019s weighted voting system; wherein the first three \\[3] ranked members in the vote will be elected to the ADPC. Albeit not legally binding, when voting for prospective members of the ADPC, delegates & token holders alike should prioritize the following eligibility criteria so as to properly equip the ADPC to carry out its mandate.\n\n**\\[ii] ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**\n\nAlbeit not being legally binding, prospective voters looking to assess election applicants should in-principle conduct their assessments in light of these criteria.\n\nExperience\n\n* A demonstrated knowledge of procurement principles & best practices;\n* In-depth knowledge of procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time;\n* At least 3 years experience in Legal, Operations or Administrative role.\n\nIntegrity\n\n* Disclosure of any involvement in ethical breaches, fraud, manipulation, or other forms of misconduct, whether in the past or present.\n* Failure to provide accurate and complete disclosure of such information will result in the forfeiture of the applicant\u2019s eligibility upon the discovery of this information.\n\nConflicts of Interest and Independence of Mind\n\n* Disclosure is required for any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may emerge upon being selected for the role applied for.\n* This includes any factors that may impair one\u2019s ability to carry out decisions with sound, objective, and independent judgment.\n\nIndustry Knowledge\n\n* A comprehensive grasp of industry-specific service procurement challenges, procurement frameworks, and prevailing best practices.\n* Previous experience drafting governance proposals.\n\nAnalytical Skills for Service Contracts\n\n* Robust analytical capabilities for evaluating and negotiating service contracts, including service-level agreements (SLAs) and performance metrics.\n* The ability to identify and assess risks associated with service procurement decisions.\n\nFinancial Acumen (Service Costs)\n\n* A firm grounding in financial aspects of service procurement, including budgeting, cost analysis, and financial implications.\n\nCommunication Skills\n\n* Exceptional communication abilities, both oral and written, for interactions with service providers, stakeholders, and fellow committee members.\n* The capacity to convey complex service procurement information clearly and effectively.\n\nNegotiation\n\n* A high degree of proficiency in negotiating service agreements and SLAs to secure favorable terms, pricing structures, and quality standards with service providers should the need arise.\n* The ability to build and maintain positive relationships with service providers.\n\nProject Management Abilities\n\n* Proficiency in project management related to service procurement, including project planning, execution, and performance monitoring.\n* The capability to manage timelines, resources, and deliverables effectively for service projects.\n\nEthical Conduct\n\n* An unwavering commitment to ethical conduct in all service procurement activities, ensuring transparency and fairness in service provider whitelisting & facilitation.\n\nTeam Player\n\n* The ability to function effectively as a team player within the committee and collaborate with other organizational departments, stakeholders, and service providers.\n* Willingness to consider diverse perspectives and reach consensus on service procurement decisions.\n\nTechnology Proficiency\n\n* Familiarity with service procurement software and tools for managing service procurement processes, data analysis, and reporting.\n* Previous experience with Asana/Airtable.\n* Previous experience with Multi-Sigs.\n\nDecision-Making Skills\n\n* Sound judgment and decision-making skills to make informed and strategic service procurement choices aligned with the organization\u2019s service procurement strategy.\n\n**\\[iii] ELECTION PROCESS**\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ADPC Members \\[REF:\u00a0[The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs\u00a05](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)]. Hereunder, we propose an adapted model of Section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to implement in the ADPC Elections.\n\nThe ADPC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the ratification of the on-chain proposal that will secure the funding for the ADPC.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has been finalized.\n\nAll ADPC committee members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ADPC \\[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions in the Checks & Balances section].\n\nThere will be one election with the first three \\[3] ranking members in the weighted voting Snapshot being elected to the ADPC.\n\n**\\[iv] PROCEDURE & ELECTION TIMELINE**\n\n1.

These dashboard will also grant applicants going through the procurement process insight into internal timelines & progress, thus ensuring a high degree of transparency operationally.\n\n**ADPC \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ADPC\u2019s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* DisruptionJoe \\[Plularity Labs]\n* [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3)\u00a0\\[Premia Finance]\n* [@limes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/limes)\n* [@KlausBrave](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave)\n* Dan \\[Vela]\n\nThe ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\nThe ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and members elected:\n\n* Streaming of funds to elected members through Hedgey on a monthly basis. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote as the ArbitrumDAO will be made the Grant Admin on the Hedgey module.\n* Clawback capability as explained hereunder.\n\nThe Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ADPC Multi-Sig via the\u00a0[Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ADPC.](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability)\n\nIn addition, after the ADPC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ADPC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof.

    "description": "# [UPDATED] Experimental Delegates Incentive System\n# Final Version with Option 2 (Karma)\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is the final result of the proposal published and voted in favor of option 2 in snapshot. It contains some minor changes.\n\n* [Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/19467)\n* [Snapshots Voting: Option 2 - With Karma](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xef3ed3b3735cad375953947437980db576baebbba5a0c209b2cccabcb1c30740)\n\n# **Spec: Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number of eligible delegates to **50**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a good starting point, these ranking is based on the score they achieve each month.\n\n## Funding\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n**Total: 1,580,000 ARB**\n\n## **Delegate Selection Process**\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single-tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\\* So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\\* The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.* Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:1. [Core Test Proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/60371879178081104082641012273221287927865067413661362234634146098631763379427)1.

[\\[OLD\\] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency ](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\n### Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 14-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\\* Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\\* Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid monthly, we will use a point system and a framework. Please note that this framework will be developed by Karma. Delegates can track their activities using this template.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/c8a836d3-fac3-469a-bee8-993a562b21a3_original.png)\n\n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table <https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power>\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. Karma pulls the participation activity directly from onchain transactions. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR \\* 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Rn) / CR(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposal (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Rn) / CP(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 \\* TP% / 100))**\n\n### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + %CP + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum\u2019s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n* Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n* Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n* Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n* Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n* Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no?\n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nOn the last day of each month, the incentive system administrator is responsible for collecting and carefully reviewing the data provided by Karma. During this initial stage, several inconsistencies are likely to be identified and corrected. Subsequently, the administrator should announce on the forum the names of the delegates selected to receive incentives, as well as the amounts allocated to each. This procedure must be completed within 10 days.\n\nAfter the publication of these results, the delegates will have a period of 2 days to present any dispute, in case they disagree with the amounts or the selection made.\n\n### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success.\n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be executed from the programs multisig, with full details of the payments posted on the forum, between the 13th and 14th. This will be repeated for the duration of the program.\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the administration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the administration of said program the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates.\n\n***\n\n# **Karma automation for the delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. Given the experimental nature of this program, they have committed to implementing any modification necessary to the program, including new parameters. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n   **Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates\u2019 forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n* **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n* **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n* **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n* **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n* **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n* **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on the successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n* **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n## Multisig Management\n\nSince it would be very complicated to KYC 50 delegates (or more) for this program, and following the Foundation's recommendation, we're going to proceed with a multisig to manage payments.\n\nWe propose to use a configuration similar to that of [Plurality Labs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976#multisig-management-13). Having a 3/5 multisig where apart from myself, there would be a mix of DAO delegates + contributors, each receiving a 1,000 ARB payment per month for the duration of the program.\n\n#### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module\n\n* DAO can clawback funds from a multisig directly to its treasury with a vote\n* Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers\n* This multisig will be configured with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally.\n\n**Zodiac module:** <https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum-delegate-incentives-zodiac-module>\n\n#### Signatories\n\nWe propose that the signatories be:\n\n* @Frisson\n* @dk3\n* @JoJo\n* @maxlomu\n* @cattin\n\n**Multisig:** 0xff1f38f8cDae7C1B1B289FCF6f5C1AA234DF1443\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nWe will also assume the responsibilities of the incentive system administrator, as mentioned in the previous points.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## Key Points\n\n**Scoring**\n\n* Karma Delegate Dashboard\n\n**Minimum score to receive incentives**\n\n* TP= +60%\n\n**Bonus Point**\n\n* +30% TP\n\n**Parameter Snapshot**\n\n* Last day of the month 23:59 UTC\n\n**Dispute**\n\n* 2 days\n\n**Payments**\n\n* On the 13th-14th of each month from a multisig.\n\n**Incentive system administrator**\n\n* SEED Latam / Any delegate or entity willing to collaborate\n\n### Total Cost: 1,580,000\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n> **Note**\n> Costs may vary, since we probably won't give the max amount to every delegate every month, so the cost mentioned would be the max this program would cost assuming we compensate 50 delegates per month for 6 months with the maximum allocation.\n\n## Reports\n\nSEEDLatam commits to deliver two reports, one after the third month and one after the sixth (and final) month of the program with metrics on its impact, delegates' performance, and expenditures. They will also collect feedback from both the community and participating delegates.\n\n*The reports will be a detailed forum post and also accompanied by a community call explaining the metrics and feedback collected.*\n\n**ArbitrumDAO has the power to:**\n\n* Change the direction or parameters of the program when it deems necessary, with a snapshot vote.\n* Terminate the program at any time, with a snapshot vote.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nPlease note that this initial incentive system is experimental and is not intended to be the final version. With this initiative, we aim to evaluate the performance of the DAO and determine its impact. We also anticipate collaboration from both the DAO and facilitators to ensure its success.\n\nAt the end of the six months, SEED Latam commits to delivering a report containing the gathered data and feedback from the governance.\n\n## Modifications introduced post-snapshot\n\n* Karma integration (since option 2 won)\n* One additional parameter to include forum activity\n* Multisig since it would be operationally unviable to KYC every delegate"

    "description": "# Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal \n### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the \u201cStage 1\u201d designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to \u201cStage 0\u201d designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See \u2018Specifications\u2019 for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik\u2019s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power\n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay\n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it\u2019s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1. The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n* The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n* The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n  \u00a0\n  Increasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it\u2019s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn\u2019t require an on-chain upgrade.\n  \u00a0\n  On the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n1. The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the \u2018DelayedInbox\u2019. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n2. The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n**Chosen solution:** In the [temperature check vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc591f79422bf26faf13055df098142569785c04316fdae5be993e282721eb717) Arbitrum DAO decided to increase the threshold of the non-emergency Security Council to 9/12.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 4 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere\u2019s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal."

Should the proposal be approved by the ArbitrumDAO, the Foundation will update its upcoming annual transparency report due in Q1 2025 to include and detail this additional budget.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn line with its mission as laid out in its\u00a0[bylaws](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf), The Arbitrum Foundation is committed to fostering ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. All agreements are designed to support projects that can grow the Arbitrum ecosystem and provide value to the ArbitrumDAO. By seeking projects that advance or contribute to the adoption of Arbitrum technology, the Foundation aims to grow activity on the Arbitrum networks.\n\nAgreements typically last for a few years with the intention to align a project\u2019s interests with the long-term objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This results in significant capital locked in commitments and reserved for projects based on the agreed performance milestones. This restricts the Foundation\u2019s ability to pursue new partnerships and stay ahead of the competition. Given the aggregate size of Foundation\u2019s current budget, it is difficult for us to pursue multiple large deals simultaneously.\n\n# Challenges\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation runs two funding programs:\n\n* Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program\n* Strategic Partnership\u2019s Program\n\nBoth programs invite applicants from the ecosystem while actively pursuing new opportunities by participating in competitive bids to prospective partners. In both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation signs milestone-based agreements with the recipient that are often multi-year contractual commitments. To date, agreements for our strategic partnerships program typically exceed 2M ARB with an average duration of 2.1 years.\n\n*Table: Capital Commitments to Grants, Strategic Partnerships and Infrastructure Service Providers (as of June 30, 2024)*\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/09ddb4e1-283e-43f6-a2b0-38f42d7edc6e_original.png)The above table provides an overview of The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s outstanding capital commitments since inception, as of June 30th 2024. Based on the stage of commitment, we can classify all existing deals into two categories:\n\n* **Signed agreements.**\u00a0The Arbitrum Foundation and the grant recipient or service provider have entered into an agreement. Most grant recipients will be entitled to grant payouts as milestones and/or other criteria are reached. The amounts in the table reflect the value of future financial obligations related to signed agreements.\n* **Pre-agreement offer.**\u00a0An agreement has not yet been reached but is in negotiation. The Foundation has reserved funds to ensure we can act upon the commitment when an agreement is reached. The amounts in the table reflect the full value of the agreement.\n\nIn both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation must have adequate reserves immediately available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Arbitrum Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners at the same time. Also, the Foundation must be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.\n\nWith the above in mind, The Arbitrum Foundation is at a distinct disadvantage from extending competitive offers to strategic partners due to the size of our overall allocation from the DAO. The three major financial challenges currently facing The Arbitrum Foundation from extending continued support to ecosystem expansion are:\n\n* **Tight budget.**\u00a0Relative to competitors, the budget that the Foundation can allocate for strategic partnerships is small and puts the Arbitrum ecosystem at a significant disadvantage. For example, if we consider allocations relative to token supply, Starknet has allocated ~20% to its Foundation and grants, Optimism has 25% for ecosystem funding, ZkSync has 19.9% for ecosystem initiatives, while The Arbitrum Foundation has 7.5% allocated, but to date, The Arbitrum Foundation has only had access to approximately 1.8% because of the vesting contract. Making competitive offers requires a lot of capital that we have not been allocated relative to other Foundations.\n* **Vesting.**\u00a0The Foundation can only make offers based on the ARB that has vested to date. This is because the ArbitrumDAO can clawback the funds at any time and we must have the ARB available to pay milestones. The Foundation is committed to being solvent at all times, so our assets should always exceed our contractual liabilities.\n* **Capital lockup.**\u00a0All committed ARB in a milestone-based agreement must be allocated until the agreement terminates. For example, we could run into a situation where a grantee has not yet hit their milestones, but we need to assume they will and hold the potential payout in reserve. Additionally, some agreements require capital lockup (like RWAs), in projects where the funds belong to the Arbitrum Foundation, but they are utilized by the strategic partner\u2019s protocol.\n\nTogether, The Arbitrum Foundation does not yet have access to its full budget which has caused issues over the past year, but even if the vesting was complete, our budget still remains the smallest amongst all rollups. This impacts all programs run by The Arbitrum Foundation including strategic partnerships, technical advancement, educational and community activities.\n\nWe believe the most straightforward approach to ensuring The Arbitrum Foundation can pursue competitive deals is by increasing our budget for strategic partnerships.\n\n# Proposed Solution\n\n**Funding Request:**\u00a0**250 million ARB**\n\nIn light of the above mentioned challenges, we believe that there are several reasons why increasing our budget to specifically better support strategic partnerships is essential:\n\n* **High costs of pursuing partnerships.**\u00a0Strategic partnerships are essential for the Arbitrum ecosystem\u2019s growth, and these partnerships often come with significant capital investments from the Foundation. For example, onboarding RWAs is both challenging and capital-intensive, as experienced by the DAO as well.\n* **Expanding Orbit Chains.**\u00a0Despite more than 50 chains publicly announcing their intent to build using Orbit since the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program in January 2024, the rollup as a tech stack ecosystem is still in its early stages. Additional funding is required to enable The Arbitrum Foundation to pursue major Orbit partnerships and allow the Arbitrum ecosystem to access new markets, use cases and communities. Additionally we should note that sometimes part Orbit chain grants could be rebates on the revenue that they contribute to the Arbitrum DAO, creating a mismatch between the Arbitrum Foundation allocating resources and the DAO collecting chain fees.\n* **Gateway to DAO.**\u00a0The DAO has previously contributed to onboarding partners via programs like STEP, however, the experience has been that most institutions are not inclined toward engaging and participating in public forums, and even when they do it is after extensive conversations with The Arbitrum Foundation and its service providers, who are making them aware of the opportunities and encouraging them to get involved. As front line enablers, The Arbitrum Foundation actively builds relationships with partners and encourages all partners to engage with the DAO. Most recent examples include Securitize (via BlackRock BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton.\n* **Proven track record.**\u00a0The Foundation has a proven track record of managing and allocating funds effectively for various initiatives, as evidenced by the\u00a0[2024 Biannual Progress Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/ArbitrumFoundationBiannualReport2024H1-c8e9ab997fe68ad09c0105181f9826d8.pdf)\u00a0and successful collaborations with industry leading projects. Additionally, The Arbitrum Foundation has capitalized on emerging opportunities such as LRTs, RWAs and onchain gaming, ensuring the Arbitrum ecosystem remains competitive and innovative.\n\nWe also believe the current vesting schedule for our entire budget is still critical to remain as is for setting expectations for the Arbitrum Foundation and holding us accountable for how we execute our mission statements. This sets a good example that all programs approved by the DAO must remain accountable and should not assume they can receive all their funding immediately.\n\nWith the above in mind, we are requesting 250 million ARB from the Arbitrum DAO. The amount will solely focus on agreements fulfilling the following 3 criteria:\n\n* Key opportunities exceeding 2 million ARB\n* New agreements signed after approval of this proposal\n* Contractual commitments lasting 1 year or longer\n\nSome foreseeable capital-intensive areas include, but are not limited to, expanding the Orbit Chain ecosystem, securing new RWA opportunities, and onboarding well-known TradeFi institutions on Arbitrum. Tokens will only be allocated on an as needed-basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.\n\nThe Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. At the same time, we remain committed to respecting any confidentiality provisions stipulated in such agreements. By balancing transparency with confidentiality, the Foundation aims to balance both the sensitivity of onboarding traditional institutions to Arbitrum and also providing updates to the DAO on how the funds are being spent.\n\nOur goal with this proposal is not to maintain the status quo, it\u2019s to ensure that we can continue to foster ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. The funds will not be used for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements.\n\n### Questions from the DAO\n\nThe Foundation has acknowledged and responded to the questions posted by delegates and DAO contributors on the\u00a0[forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775/66), and will continue to respond to questions there."

    "description": "# AIP: Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration\n# AIP: Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration Proposal [2nd Revision]\n\nThis is an amended draft proposal by the RARI Foundation, addressing community feedback.\n\n## Abstract \n\nThe Rari Foundation is submitting a proposal to jumpstart the growth in the Arbitrum NFT ecosystem. The proposal involves integrating Arbitrum One with the open-source Rarible protocol, which is an indexer, orderbook and SDK powering NFT-based applications, which, once integrated, can be freely and easily used by the Artbitrum builders. \n\n## Motivation \n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is hard for independent developers to build NFT-based applications due to a lack of easy-to-use tooling and infrastructure. Without this support, the developer community will be opting for other chains with more robust support for building.\n\nOptimism vs Arbitrum NFT stats as of July 27, 2023 indicate Arbitrum is not the first choice for the creation of NFT assets or contracts. Source [NFT Scan](https://arbitrum.nftscan.com/).\n\nThe open-source Rarible Protocol is specifically focused on the NFT use case and will enable builders to develop their next dapps choosing Arbitrum, resulting in bringing in new Arbitrum users and sequencer revenue. \n\nThe Rarible Protocol is a trusted choice as it\u2019s community governed, has an easy-to-use API, a comprehensive SDK, and is committed to expanding its capabilities to power innovative NFT use cases. Furthermore, the Protocol is used by Rarible.com NFT marketplace, whose brand and community can be leveraged in raising awareness about Arbitrum venturing deeper into NFT tooling. Such signaling to the market will show that the Arbitrum community is serious about growing its ecosystem and flourishing NFTs. Rarible and the Rari Foundation will promote the integration in a cross-marketing push to ensure the NFT and crypto community knows that Arbitrum is serious about NFT growth. This support will consist of (and shall not be limited to): \n- Regular features on Rarible.com top spotlight section (1 million MAU)\n- Dedicated social support for the launch on Rarible\u2019s and Rari Foundation's owned channels (Twitter, Instagram, Discord, 800k+ followers combined)\n- Email blasts for the integration (500k+ subscribers)\n- Leveraging Rarible's and Rari Foundation's press relations\n- Potentially a hackathon\n\nThis proposal is being submitted outside of the pending grants framework, in order to implement the integration asap, as waiting for the grants framework would result in significant implementation delays. As such, the Arbitrum DAO has an opportunity to express its willingness to incentivize ecosystem growth via strategic partnerships.\n\n## Rationale \n \nThe proposed AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values by enhancing the utility, scalability, and inclusivity of the Arbitrum network. The Rarible Protocol, a decentralized toolset for NFT applications, is open-source and free, mirroring Arbitrum's commitment to technical inclusivity and neutrality.\nBy integrating Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol, we empower developers to create more complex and innovative applications on Arbitrum. This integration increases accessibility to real-time and historical Arbitrum blockchain data, aligning closely with Arbitrum's commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity. \n\n## Key Terms\n\n**The Rari Foundation:** The legal entity for the Rari DAO community that is in possession of $RARI Treasury and on the path of possession of the Rarible protocol\n\n**Rarible Inc.:** A leading NFT marketplace that allows users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs. One of the applications using the Rarible protocol.\n\n**Rarible Protocol:** Open-source, free-to-use, community-governed Protocol (which includes an SDK, indexer and orderbook) for the creation, transaction, and distribution of NFTs.\n\n**Rarible SDK:** A part of the Rarible protocol that provides a set of tools for developers to interact with multiple blockchains\n\nA few notes on the [Rarible Protocol](https://rarible.org/):\n\n- It is an open-source, EVM-based SDK and multichain indexer that currently powers 4,000+ NFT marketplaces (including Rarible.com), and a series of non-marketplace-based applications (like wallets and NFT analytics services - see more use cases [here](https://docs.rarible.org/use-cases/use-cases-overview/)). \n- Designed as a set of building blocks, the Rarible protocol empowers the creation of fully customized NFT experiences of any level and complexity. \ufe0f\n- API access is lightning-fast, unified, and comprehensive. You gain seamless access to NFT Items, Collections, -Activities, and NFT Metadata across multiple blockchains, including ETH, POL,  IMX, FLOW, TEZ, to name a few \u2014all consolidated within a single endpoint.\n- The protocol\u2019s indexer is the fastest on the market. It retrieves blockchain data through fast APIs, eliminating the need for your own indexer and reducing costs associated with maintaining Blockchain Nodes. \n- User-friendly SDK allows you to seamlessly connect wallets, mint NFTs, put them up for sale, purchase NFTs, showcase collections, and so much more.  The Protocol is the feature-rich product on the market (you can do anything NFT related on our Protocol).\n- Comprehensive Marketplace Support: Our platform offers unrivaled support for various marketplaces, providing access to aggregated orderbooks from major platforms like OS, LR, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and Tezos, so you can ensure your users have access to the most competitive listings in the market.\n- Cutting-Edge NFT API Integration: We pride ourselves on providing the best NFT API support, seamlessly integrating with popular communication tools such as Discord, Zendesk, VIP support, Slack, and TG.\n- Powerful Analytics Capabilities: Our platform boasts best-in-class analytics tools, including OLAP statistics and floor price analysis, empowering users with valuable insights into market trends and performance.\n- Unmatched Reliability: We maintain the highest level of reliability, ensuring a remarkable 99.99% uptime for our protocol, making us the most dependable choice in the market.\n\n## Specifications \n\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of how the integration will take place and the platforms and technologies that will be used. \n\n### Rarible Protocol: Integrating Arbitrum One\n\nThe Rarible Protocol is a decentralized toolset that allows developers to build NFT applications. It includes smart contracts, an indexer, an SDK, and APIs. The integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol will extend these capabilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem, enhancing its utility and inclusivity.\n\n- Rarible Arbitrum SDK\n    - The Rarible SDK will expedite Arbitrum application development. By extending the SDK to support Arbitrum One, we will provide developers with tools for interacting with smart contracts, supporting NFT operations like minting, transferring, and burning, and integrating with multiple wallets.\n- Rarible Orderbook & Smart Contracts\n    - Our contracts, specifically the Rarible Exchange V2, will be deployed to the Arbitrum chain, granting access to our off-chain order book. Certain actions such as canceling, confirming, updating, or when price changes occur, are on-chain but the creation of orders is off-chain.\n- Rarible Public API\n    - With the integration of Arbitrum One, the API will offer extended support for these chains, allowing developers to easily access and interact with NFT data on Arbitrum.\n- Rarible Arbitrum Indexer\n    - Rarible\u2019s multichain Indexer will be able to track and record NFT events on Arbitrum, providing developers with a comprehensive view of NFT activities on Arbitrum.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement \n\n### Arbitrum One integration into Rarible Protocol \n\nThe first key milestone will be integrating Arbitrum into the Rarible Protocol, which will set the foundation for future milestones involving building NFT applications on Arbitrum.\n\n**Tasks: Integration of Arbitrum One chain into Rarible Protocol**\n\n- **Arbitrum API Integration:** This task involves integrating the Arbitrum API into the Rarible Protocol API to support Arbitrum One.\n- **Node Preparation:** A separate node for Arbitrum will be set up for rapid indexing upon approval \n- **Contract Deployment:** The Rarible Shared NFT, Rarible Factory (for creating collections), and Rarible ExchangeV2 contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum for users to interact with.\n- **Orderbook:** Rarible\u2019s orderbook will be able to store listings, orders, and bids made with the protocol\nArbitrum Indexer: Index NFT contracts, ERC-721/1155, ERC-20 tokens, Exchange orders & bids (from Seaport & Rarible).\n- **Arbitrum support on Rarible Multichain SDK:** This involves adding a new blockchain, connectors to wallets, and ensuring functionality similar to ETH/Polygon.\n- **Debugging and Testing:** General debugging of all components will be conducted, along with testing on production with OpenSea orders.\n- **Build Testnet for Arbitrum:** An additional environment for the testnet will be set up, including indexing, reindexing, etc.\n\n\n## Timeline \n\nThe tentative timeline consists of 7 weeks in total, 5 of which are the integration phase. If the proposal is approved by early September 2023, the project implementation can be executed in early Q4 2023. \n\n## Overall Cost \n\nAs the integration of the Rarible Protocol and Arbitrum will benefit both ecosystems, we are offering to split the Rarible Protocol integration costs between our two parties with an equal share.\n\n### Integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol\n**Duration:** 5 Weeks  \n**Costs:** 200,000 $ (Artibtrum portion = **100,000 $**)\n\n**Payment terms:**\n\n50% payable upon proposal approval\n\n50% payable upon completion (identified as the release of Rarible's protocol integration to Arbitrum, with the API up and running, contracts deployed, NFTs are queryable)\n\nThe 100,000 USD amount is payable in ARB under the exchange rate on the day of the proposal submission. As of Sept 13, the rate is 1 ARB = $0.785339, which translates to 127,351 ARB.\n\nNote that the Rari Foundation will absorb costs related to the service and maintainance of the Protocol upkeep after the integration implementation.\n"

    "description": "# Delegate to Voter Enfranchisement Pool \u2014 Event Horizon\n# **Summary**\n\nEvent Horizon is a public good. It is a public-access metagovernance block. With the aim of enfranchising the tens of thousands of small voters, this proposal suggests we delegate (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a non-optimistic 1 year renewal. This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass and Gitcoin Pass holders functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore more incentive to express their voices. The Gitcoin DAO has [<u>recently passed</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8) a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the #6 delegate on Gitcoin.\u00a0\n\nWe also request a grant of 200k ARB to help the team maintain this public good across this 1 year experiment in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket for the Arbitrum community over the past several months. Further, to ensure community alignment, a 5 member Oversight Committee will be paid a 125k ARB stipend broken up into monthly payments.&#x20;\n\n# **Problem**\n\nToday, typical Arbitrum voter participation rate floats in the low single digits. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Not voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ARB doesn\u2019t make sense, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation: our average participation rate is 30%.\n\n# **Mechanism**\n\nArbitrum Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks. As detailed further below, this model:\n\n1. Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means\n2. Incentivizes participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards\n3. Incentivizes participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain\n\nDAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn\u2019t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.\n\nIn this regard, Event Horizon slots into the Arbitrum ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.\n\nThis serves two functions:\n\n1. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.\n2. It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to participation is a lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who *do vote*, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who *don\u2019t vote* to those who do.\n\n**When participation is low\u2026** each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\n**When participation is high\u2026** there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.\n\nImplicit Delegation represents an effort to offer a new paradigm around means of influence. A shift from today\u2019s entirely capital-centric to a more citizen-friendly, participation-centric model.\n\nWhere Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. Because the carrot is governance voice itself, implicit delegation attracts governance-interested citizens, not capital-interested citizens; more on that below.\n\nBecause the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon\u2019s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.\n\n# **Rationale**\n\n**Delegation rationale**\n\n7,000,000 ARB would place the Event Horizon community as around the 15th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.\n\nThis proposal reflects two of Arbitrum\u2019s core mission values:\n\n1. Socially Inclusive: By constructing a dedicated block of governance authority with lower capital barriers, our community greatly expands who gets a seat at the table.\n2. Neutral and Open: By making the thoughts and ideas of this broader swath of individuals heard, we further broaden the spectrum of possibilities for the evolution of our ecosystem.\n\n**Grant rationale**\n\n1. While we initially didn\u2019t want to ask for compensation, several delegates pointed out that doing this magnitude of work for the DAO for free sets a bad precedent for future builders. It sends the wrong message of \u201cdo not build here, your work is not valued by the Arbitrum community\u201d. So despite our initial hesitation, and multiple refusals to do so, we now think it important to ask for some compensation.\u00a0\n2. As for the specific grant amount, LTIPP committees members [<u>were paid 25k ARB each</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/110767177349707239820875764565747830009768307680609166467172874966002003291288) for 7.5 weeks of work, approximately $50,000 on proposal execution day (February 21, 2024). We\u2019re asking for 200k ARB total (roughly $100k at today\u2019s ARB prices) for the work already done + 1 year of work from the four members of the Event Horizon team and all associated build costs and ongoing maintenance expenses. This is not to depreciate the value of LTIPP committee members, but to draw a humble comparison of the value of our engineering and governance labor both already done and yet to come in this next year. In fact, this pricing (adjusting for price action between LTIPP and now) explicitly values the work of LTIPP committee members at nearly 19x that of the Event Horizon team ($6.7k per LTIPP committee member per week vs. $480 per EH team member per week), not counting the previous year of work that went into building the already functioning product.\n\nWe will also have to pay for a Snapshot subscription which is $6k / year which will come out of the grant. Further labor expenses can be broken down by categories and priced as follows:\n\n1. Launch pass minting on Arbitrum \u2013 40k ARB\n2. Maintain functionality through any changes in Arbitrums governance process \u2013 40k ARB\n3. Maintain and further streamline voter onboarding UX \u2013 40k ARB\n4. Bi-annual reporting including KPIs such as voters, participation rate, voters above key threshold amounts (say $1k worth of ARB), etc. \u2013 40k ARB\n5. Service fee \u2013 40k ARB\u00a0&#x20;\n\n# **Benefits compared to Token Incentivized Governance:**\n\nWhile token rewards for participation hold legitimate merit and are an intuitive remedy for low turnout, it has limitations.\n\n1. Misaligned Incentives: Token-based incentives attract returns-interested parties. However, when it comes to governance, participation is most valuable when it comes from those interested in participating not payout. Implicit delegation directly appeals to these individuals as it rewards those who participate, not with capital, but with greater voting power.\n\n*Added Thought Capital: in line with the notion above, there are likely thousands of community members each holding both strong ideas and valuable contributions for the ecosystem, but simply lack enough voice to justify participation. Through Implicit Delegation, any community member of the Arbitrum ecosystem has an opportunity to have their voice heard, bringing thousands more minds and ideas to the surface.*\n\n1. Inflationary: While token rewards drive participation at the expense of inflation, Implicit delegation simply leverages its game theory model to increase incentive to vote in the form of a greater voting share. This does not cost the token any inflation, nor the treasury any ARB.\n2. Non-scalable: Token-based rewards are finite and require a constant drain of ARB funds to continue driving participation. As the ecosystem scales, and more participants join, greater and greater sums of ARB will be needed to continue fueling growth. Implicit delegation has no cost, and its balanced game theory functions with no burn. As more citizen voters join, more Arb could be delegated to the community block, however, again, this is not a cost as the ARB tokens are still retained by the treasury.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n**Past Performance**\n\nThe above is not just theory. The Event Horizon community is already active on Ethereum providing metagoverning public goods to Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, ShapeShift, and of course, Arbitrum. In fact, in several recent Uniswap votes, the Event Horizon community was the 10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem. Event Horizon has also recently voted as the 8th largest delegate in recent Aave votes. Gitcoin DAO [<u>just voted</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8) to make Event Horizon the 6th largest delegate in the DAO via delegation.\u00a0\n\nWhile there is still quite a gap between Event Horizon and the larger delegates in the larger DAOs, interestingly enough this position serves as a line of demarcation between individual delegates above, and citizens below. This dynamic does, however, highlight a call to action. Raise the long tail a bit, and bring in more voices. Sure, voting isn\u2019t the full picture of DAO decision making, but it\u2019s a great place to start. Individual, organization AND citizen delegations are all valuable and mutually *inclusive*, three symbiotic pillars for a strong ecosystem.\n\nSince its inception just a few months ago, the Event Horizon protocol has processed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals and placed over $55,000,000 of governance authority and enfranchisement directly into the hands of the citizen voter, a feat not seen anywhere else in the DAO space. This is $55,000,000 of voice amplification for the low-capital, high-conviction citizen which would never have been possible prior to the Event Horizon's product. Across all proposals for which the Event Horizon Community has participated, the community\u2019s cumulative voter footprint is on pace to exceed $55,000,000. Some more metrics worth highlighting:\n\n**Number of Metagovernance Proposals Passed ~500**Our community members have participated in and passed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals, each corresponding to Arbitrum or other DAO proposals.\n\n**Voter Participation: >30%**Over thirty percent of our community members have participated in our metagovernance proposals. Some participants have voted as many as 63 times in under 5 months. Check out the latest info on our leaderboard: EventHorizon.vote/leaderboard\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized per Participating Passholder: >$365,000 (and counting)**For the cost of $3 in gas, each participating passholder has mobilized an average of just over $100,000 in Uniswap and AAVE authority governance authority across all metagovernance proposals passed.\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized Multiple: >121,500x (and growing)**The average pass holder minted their voter pass for ~$3 in gas. When compared to the $365,000 in average authority mobilized, each member has mobilized over 40,000x their gas cost of admission in blue-chip governance authority\n\n# **Steps to Implementation**\n\nPer the recommended process of the Arbitrum Foundation, the DAO moves 7.2m ARB to the Oversight Committee multi-signature wallet (0x15C4edF2cF2f36335e42c19E506Ed6cB16a57D8F) which will then delegate to the Arbitrum Community Governance wallet.\n\nThe EventHorizonArbitrum.eth wallet automatically votes in support of the passholder consensus while the Oversight Committee can force an Abstain vote with a \u2157 vote to do so. The five signers are:\n\n1. Michael (Open Zeppelin) 0xBE1d294FD9B71Ae2F6831Eb80777fF73fb73c953\n2. Frisson (Tally): 0xb5D8fe0De11e6a95F1c2D217C55dc4f010EAc7c1\n3. Jordan (Event Horizon): 0x50c28a42AC91F6E6437A036D320c9242432CCE3F\n4. Juanbug (PGov): 0xB8Dcad009E533066F12e408075E10E3a30F1f15A\n5. DisruptionJoe (Arbitrum Delegate): 0x01Cf9fD2efa5Fdf178bd635c3E2adF25B2052712\n\nThe Oversight Committee members will also receive a monthly stipend of 2083 ARB per month so as to maintain an ethos of \u201cyour labor is paid\u201d in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\u00a0\n\nAfter initial delegation from the DAO Event Horizon handles everything from there. Event Horizon will facilitate and maintain all elements of the pool from pass minting to metagovernance.\u00a0\n\nAgain, this delegation would not be a grant and funds would remain in the DAO-controlled wallet. Consider us a delegate + service provider like any of the other talented delegates and service providers currently supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem.The 200K grant distributions are to be sent to an Event Horizon safe with the 75K ARB direct grant to be retained and the 125K ARB oversight committee payments being emitted to all members by EH in monthly bulk txs.\n\n# **Technical Implementation**\n\nPer the recommendation of the Arbitrum Foundation, the proposal will forego the Franchiser contract approach in favor of a multi-signature wallet structure. With the passing of this proposal, the DAO will transfer 7M ARB to the Oversight Committee multi-signature wallet. The Oversight Committee will then delegate the voting rights to the Arbitrum Community Delegation wallet. Should the DAO wish to recall the delegation, an on chain vote will no longer be required. Instead, a snapshot proposal will suffice. In addition to all previously mentioned rights, the Oversight Committee will be beholden to a community Snapshot vote, and will retain the ability to undelegate and return all ARB to the DAO treasury at any point per the request of the DAO.\n\n*Previous Model for Reference: In order to implement this proposal, it is required that we create a DAO-controlled Franchiser contract. The contract owner would be the DAO timelock and it would allow the DAO the power to delegate and undelegate tokens that it sends from the treasury to the Franchiser. We suggest that the Foundation aids in the creation of this contract in order to create an official and safe implementation, though we can likely fork the Trail of Bits audited Uniswap Labs* [*implementation*](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf754A7E347F81cFdc70AF9FbCCe9Df3D826360FA) *\\[*[*github*](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser)*] of the same concept. If this proposal passes Snapshot, we request that the Foundation take the time to fork the contract and hire an auditor to check the implementation.*\n\n*The contract has simple functions:*\n\n* *Fund: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate to a single address*\n* *FundMany: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate any amount to multiple addresses*\n* *Recall: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from a single delegate.*\n* *RecallMany: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from multiple delegates.*\n\n*It is worth noting that all tokens sent to the Franchiser will remain a part of the DAO\u2019s balance sheet as it has full-control over the contract. The delegated tokens never leave the DAO\u2019s ownership.*\n\n*Forking and auditing this franchiser contract would be useful for Arbitrum\u2019s version of* [*retroactive delegation*](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-12-empowering-underrepresented-delegates/21533) *(updated version to be posted shortly). Crucially, we view both this proposal (delegating to EH\u2019s citizen enfranchisement pool) and the above retroactive delegation proposal (boosting active delegates in the 10k-1m ARB range) as two sides of the same coin of the* [*community\u2019s call*](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-call-for-creative-uses-of-delegation-to-boost-participation/21235/7) *for creative ways to boost citizen participation and governance decision making processes.*\n\n# **Additional Considerations**\n\nThe Arbitrum Event Horizon Oversight Committee: A committee of 5 existing, notable delegates will be voted on by the Arbitrum community to be given the ability to guide the Event Horizon voting pool on matters of Arbitrum metagovernance. A simple 3/5 majority would allow this committee to veto the decisions of the voter pool within the 24 hours between the closing of the Event Horizon proposal, and the underlying DAO\u2019s proposal.\n\nSybil Considerations: it is important to note that the delegated ARB is by a large margin a minority voter amount. Any potential risk of Sybil influence over the public-access block would under almost all conditions not amount to a sum of authority that would be capable of passing a vote absent incredibly significant broader support from other delegates and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem participants. E.g. a rogue vote is virtually impossible.\n\nThat being said, we will be implementing Gitcoin Passport requirements for Arbitrum metagovernance."

    "description": "# AIP-7: Arbitrum One Governance Parameter Fixes\n# AIP-7: Arbitrum One Governance Parameter Fixes\n\n## Non-Constitutional \n\n## Abstract\nThree independent issues have been identified in the Arbitrum One Governance system and the current proposal aims to address them. Given this is maintenance of the system, after the forum discussion period it will skip the Snapshot temperature check and go directly for an on-chain vote.\n\n## Specifications \n\n### 1. Updating the airdrop distributor fee sweep address to the DAO Treasury\u2019s address\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO airdrop was distributed to users via the [TokenDistributor contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x67a24CE4321aB3aF51c2D0a4801c3E111D88C9d9). The recipients are able to claim their tokens until the Ethereum block #18208000 (estimated to be created on the 24th September 2023).\n\nAfter the claim period is over, unclaimed leftover tokens may be swept over to the specified sweepReceiver address, which is currently set to the [L2 treasury timelock](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses). Per the [Governance Architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#overall-configuration) documentation, this should be set to the [DAO Treasury\u2019s address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58).\n\n**Fix:** \nCall the the 'setSweepReciever()' function on the TokenDistributor contract, and include the [DAO Treasury address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58) as the _sweepReceiver(address).\n\n### 2. Sequencer gas fee reimbursement parameterization\n\nThe Arbitrum One sequencer pays the necessary gas fees for posting user transactions to Ethereum. This is done through transactions to the Sequencer inbox.\n\nThe sequencer gets reimbursed for these fees in Arbitrum One. The reimbursement is calculated by ArbOS, but two parameters are currently incorrectly configured.\n\n1. The Sequencer Inbox has a fixed cost associated with including a transaction. The value is currently configured to 100000 Ethereum L1 gas units - this can be viewed in the ArbGasInfo precompile through the getPerBatchGasCharge function. If you inspect transactions live in the system (sample from [June 15th](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/mainnet/0xd2eb2dea13148ac8080544cd4eb1df27ad984055760609b23664a54d6e3e24c4/gas-usage) and [July 17th](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/mainnet/0xe11e940a8e0e21c3092bf1785438351348d333a751f658838f0a90dc27813058/gas-usage)), it is possible to see that the fixed cost of including a batch is actually much closer to 240000 Ethereum L1 gas units.\n\n2. The ArbOS L1 pricing system features an optional \u201camortization cost cap\u201d which is intended to subsidize the fixed posting cost for chains with low activity or AnyTrust chains whose fixed cost is much larger than other data posting costs. This feature was not intended to be enabled on Arbitrum One. As such, the cap was set to its maximum value, 2^64 - 1 (this can be viewed in the ArbGasInfo precompile through the getAmortizedCostCapBips function). However, this did not fully disable the cap. As visible in the code, the amortization cap is only disabled with a value of 0. With the cap set to its maximum value, but still enabled, the cap would prevent the L1 pricer from taking into account the cost of multiple batches posted in the same L1 block. That\u2019s because it would consider the costs of all but the first batch as having a weight of zero, because no time passes since the previous batch if the batches are in the same L1 block. Setting the amortization cap to 0 fixes this issue by bypassing the previously linked if statement to fully disable the amortization code.\n\nThe combination of these two issues add up to gas funds being incorrectly charged to end users, thus not fully reimbursing sequencer operations. This fix will increase fees for users but they will now reflect the actual costs of the system - it is expected to be a minor difference.\n\n**Fix** \n\u27a1\ufe0f Transaction to [ArbOwner](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070#writeContract) precompile calling setPerBatchGasCharge(int64) with the intended value '240000'.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Transaction to [ArbOwner](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070#writeContract) precompile calling setAmortizedCostCapBips(uint64) with the intended value '0'.\n\n### 3. L1 Core Governance Timelock scheduleBatch Bug\n\nWhen executing a batch of operations on the [L1ArbitrumTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6841D92B0C345144506576eC13ECf5103aC7f49), if more than one operation creates a retryable ticket (i.e., more than one operation targets an L2 chain), the full msg.value value will be forwarded to each one. If not properly constructed, this can lead to retryable tickets that fail to get created. While there are workarounds, the current implementation is error-prone and the fix allows for more graceful creation of several L1 to L2 operations.\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade the implementation of the [L1ArbitrumTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6841D92B0C345144506576eC13ECf5103aC7f49) with the change [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/86/files#diff-93cdc770d0b61d15d694632048ac3aa46ff9dd5fa5bfae6b1310568b2e1df187).\n\n\u2013\n\nThe fixes were implemented through Governance Action contracts and can be viewed on the [Governance codebase](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/tree/7d6f4dac06ab98eaa0a4bef9c0dc09a9af6d67fd/src/gov-action-contracts/AIPs/MiscAIP). They have been audited by Trail of Bits and no issues were identified - the audit report will be shared publicly soon.\n\nThe Action contracts have been deployed to the following addresses and can be verified/audited by the community:\n\n* UpdateGasChargeAction: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7b1247f443359d1447cf25e73380bc9b99f2628f\n* SetSweepReceiverAction: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xbaba4daf5800b9746f58c724f05e03880850d578\n* UpdateL1CoreTimelockAction: https://etherscan.io/address/0xbaba4daf5800b9746f58c724f05e03880850d578\n"

    "description": "# Constitutional AIP - Extend Delay on L2Time Lock\n## Abstract\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO has on-chain governance via a suite of smart contracts. It allows the ArbitrumDAO to spend funds from its treasury alongside upgrading any smart contract that governs Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal\u2019s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.\n\nThe proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed. The focus is on the\u00a0*L2 Core Time Lock*\u00a0contract that lives on Arbitrum One and proposes changing the delay from 3 days to 8 days which effectively increases the delay by an additional 5 days.\n\nThere are two benefits to increasing the delay:\n\n* **Security Council.**\u00a0The Security Council will have more time to act if a malicious proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO for whatever reason.\n* **Exit window.**\u00a0Users will have more time to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova if they are worried or not satisfied about how a proposal intends to change the smart contracts that govern Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.\n\nAdditionally, by increasing the exit window, it will also update the status of Arbitrum by L2Beat and replace a red slice with a yellow slice. This will help Arbitrum move one step closer towards a Stage-2 rollup.\n\nThe downside of increasing the delay is that all constitutional proposals, primarily for upgrading the smart contracts, will be delayed by an additional 5 days. It does not impact or add an additional delay to any spending from the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s treasury including ARB and ETH.\n\n## Time Lock Extension\n\n[<img height=\"316\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de_2_624x316.png\" />1600\u00d7809 143 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de.png)\n*Image:*\u00a0*Overview of the Current Time Locks*\n\n# [Constitutional - Extend Delay on L2Time Lock](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-extend-delay-on-l2time-lock/26470)\n\nAll proposals voted on and passed by the ArbitrumDAO must pass through an L2 Time Lock before it can move onto the next stage.\n\nThere are currently two L2 Time Locks that are implemented via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\n\n* **L2 Treasury TimeLock.**\u00a0Delays all spends from the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s ETH Treasury.\n* **L2 Core TimeLock.**\u00a0Delays any actions related to on-chain upgrades.\n\nThe proposal focuses on the Core L2 TimeLock. It is responsible for passing messages that contain executable code and it has the authority to upgrade any smart contract in the system including on-chain governance and the bridges (holding user assets) on Arbitrum One/Nova.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the governance of smart contracts, please check out this\u00a0[diagram\u00a03](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/roundtrip-governance.png?raw=true)\u00a0and the\u00a0[docs\u00a03](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md).\n\n## Steps to Implement & Timeline\n\nThe proposal is to change the value of \\_minDelay from 259200 (seconds) to 691200 (seconds) in the\u00a0[L2 Timelock\u00a02](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0#readProxyContract)\u00a0contract. This will change the time delay from 3 days to 8 days, an additional 5 days.\n\nThe action contract is implemented and still pending an audit:\n\n[github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306)\n\n#### [Updates timelock delay\u00a02](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306)\n\nSeatbelt: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/pull/34](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/pull/34)\n\nAdditionally, we will need to update the ArbitrumDAO Constitution:\n\n> Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the 3 day waiting period in Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n\nThe Constitution Text will be updated to the following:\n\n> Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 or 8 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, there is a 3 day waiting period for actions related to the DAO Treasury and an 8 day waiting period for an L2-to-L1 Message. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the waiting period for Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n\nThe new constitution hash:\u00a0`0x28faf2acba9b3ff80ec484e3d5646931eeef40568b1b7c38dbe52b890bfd7938`\n\n# Timeline\n\n* **Feedback Period:**\u00a023/8/24 to 29/8/24\n* **Temperature Check:**\u00a029/8/24 to 5/9/24\n* **ARDC Review:**\u00a05/9/24 to 16/9/24\n* **On-chain vote:**\u00a023/9/24\n\nThere is no cost to the ArbitrumDAO for the implementation of this proposal and an audit will be publicly available prior to the on-chain vote."

    "description": "# The Watchdog: Arbitrum DAO\u2019s Grant Misuse Bounty Program\n## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO has\u00a0[allocated](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-governance-proposals)\u00a0several hundred million dollars across various initiatives, including incentive programs, grants, investment vehicles, and service providers. While these allocations have driven growth and innovation, there has been minimal oversight or review of how these funds are ultimately used, and no system currently exists to incentivize the identification and reporting of fund misappropriation. Although three instances of misuse have been uncovered, it is likely that additional cases remain undetected.\n\nIn response, Entropy Advisors proposes the establishment of a\u00a0**grant misuse bounty program dubbed \u201cThe Watchdog\u201d**\u00a0to incentivize the identification and reporting of misused DAO-allocated funds. The program would utilize an incentive mechanism to reward community contributors and investigators who submit verifiable reports of misappropriation.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nBy offering financial rewards for valid reports of misappropriation, there will be a stronger motivation for community members to contribute skills or information that aid in identifying misconduct in the DAO. Today, the identification of wrongdoing can result in retaliation, unnecessary friction within the DAO, and other negative externalities for the investigators.\n\nMoreover, with no incentive to bring forth allegations, it is unlikely that most community members would do so. The Watchdog program creates a decentralized force of accountability, augmenting the DAO\u2019s capacity to detect abuse that would likely otherwise go unnoticed while protecting the submitter from repercussions.\n\nArbitrum DAO\u2019s successful identification of misappropriated funds, whether by a service provider, protocol, grant recipient, or anyone else that receives funds from Arbitrum DAO has three main benefits:\n\n1. The DAO (mainly through the Foundation, as it has done so in the past) may be able to recapture some of the funds. This could involve legal avenues, smart contract enforcement (clawbacks / stream stopping), or community pressure through the use of the DAO\u2019s blacklisting abilities.\n2. The evidence can be used to identify possible improvement opportunities in the underlying programs and make more informed decisions surrounding the recognized bad actors in the future.\n3. A mechanism for malicious action deterrence and attracts sophisticated onchain sleuths to Arbitrum.\n\nJust the existence of a transparent and well-publicized bounty program will likely deter some malicious actors from misusing DAO funds in the first place. Knowing that the community has the tools and incentives to identify misallocation increases the risk of exposure for those who might consider abusing the DAO\u2019s trust. Recipients of DAO funds will need to think twice before acting maliciously or in a way that doesn\u2019t align with the DAO\u2019s strategic objectives, rules, and the broader interests of Arbitrum.\n\nBy allowing anyone to submit evidence-based reports of misuse anonymously, the program empowers the entire Arbitrum and crypto ecosystem to take an active role in maintaining the financial health and integrity of the Arbitrum DAO. We hope this fosters a culture of vigilance, good intentions, and accountability while bringing white-hat actors into the ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Watchdog program will extend to ALL DAO-funded initiatives including end recipients of other programs such as the Questbook Domain program, Stylus Sprint, Arbitrum Foundation grants, and the incentives programs. The process for rewarding those who successfully identify fund misuse will start with a temporary solution utilizing a small committee of reviewers with a long-term plan for the program to eventually fall under OpCo.\n\nEntropy proposes the following definition of misuse of funds:\n\n*Any action or inaction by a recipient of DAO-allocated funds that directly violates the stated terms, objectives, agreement, or overall spirit of the allocation under which those funds were provided.*\n\nMisuse definitions and examples below are included solely as a point of reference for the DAO and all decisions surrounding severity will be at the full discretion of the committee:\n\n* **Low:**\u00a0Cases where there is minor misuse of DAO-allocated funds with limited impact on the DAO\u2019s overall financial health, reputation, or strategic goals.\n  * Example: A Questbook domain allocator accidentally sent a double payment for a milestone and the recipient did not report it.\n  * Example: A grant recipient uses a portion of the funds for unauthorized purposes, such as non-DAO-aligned marketing, travel, or administrative overhead not included in the grant proposal.\n* **Medium:**\u00a0Cases involving significant misuse of DAO-allocated funds that impact the DAO\u2019s resources or strategic goals, but where the misuse is still recoverable, or partial results have been delivered.\n  * Example: An incentive program recipient uses funds in a way that does not benefit end users, but is a step away from outright theft and fraud.\n  * Example: A grant recipient diverts a significant portion of the funds (e.g., 50k+ ARB) to unrelated projects or personal use.\n* **High:**\u00a0Cases involving large-scale, deliberate misuse of DAO-allocated funds.\n  * Example: A fund-recipient fabricates deliverables to obtain funds without working on the approved project, then disappears with the entire grant.\n  * Example 2: Theft or unauthorized transfers, such as if MSS members purposefully diverted funds to a recipient not eligible.\n\nThe workflow for Watchdog reports will be as follows:\n\n**1. Report Submission**\n\n* Anyone (watchers) can identify potential misuse of funds that originated from the DAO and submit an evidence-based report to a designated section on a to-be-created GlobaLeaks portal (explained further below).. Throughout the entire process, the identity of the submitter will remain private. As detailed further in step 3, the report will only be made public to the DAO in the instance that attempts at backchannel communications with the alleged party fail and a DAO ban is constituted or on a case-by-case basis where the committee deems it prudent to make the DAO aware of the misuse.\n* Reports will follow a standard template to help streamline the review process and collect the initial necessary information.\n\n**2. Review Process**\n\n* A whitelisted group of three DAO-associated reviewers will have the ability to review the submitted reports. The initial reviewers will comprise the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and SeedGov. This structure minimizes the operating costs of the program until OpCo is stood up. Entropy and the Arbitrum Foundation will be waiving payment as reviewers. SeedGov will be compensated at a rate of $40 an hour for the time their team puts towards reviewing Watchdog reports each month. The payment will be paid out in ARB with the amount being determined based on the price of ARB at the time of payment. This rate is comparable to the rate SeedGov is receiving as the DIP administrator. We anticipate the review process for a Watchdog report to take a minimal amount of hours, so the ARB used to pay SeedGov will come from the requested 400K ARB budget.\n* The three reviewers will discuss reports and, if required, contact the concerned party for clarifications. If two or more reviewers agree (at their discretion) that the submission is based on substance and misuse has occurred, the watcher(s) will receive the bounty. The reviewers will also determine the level of severity of the misuse (Low, Medium, High), which will impact the bounty reward as outlined in step 4.\n* In the case that 2 or more reviewers deem there has been fund misuse, and recovery is deemed feasible, the Arbitrum Foundation will open up private channels of communication with the concerned party and attempt to get the funds back for the DAO.\n* Reviewers are required to abstain from specific review processes if a conflict of interest (COI) is identified. If two or more reviewers have an identified COI, the reviewers will identify two external parties who don\u2019t have COIs and have the capabilities to review the report. If the report is made public, the reviewers\u2019 identified COIs will be published at the same time. To reduce the need for an additional election process and budgeted compensation, the Watchdog program will leverage trusted community members who have been elected to other Arbitrum DAO initiatives such as, but not limited to, the Domain Allocators from the D.A.O. program, MSS members, or ARDC V2 members.\n\n**3. DAO Forum & Snapshot Voting**\n\n* On a case by case basis, if all attempts at backchanneling fail and the accused party is nonresponsive, the report may be posted to the forum with all the watcher\u2019s personal and identifiable information redacted in the version posted publicly. Additionally, on a case by case basis, the committee may decide to post a summary of a grant misuse report to inform the DAO of certain incidents. Otherwise individual reports will not be posted to the forum directly. It is Entropy\u2019s belief that in instances of low misuse, it is unwise to subject teams to public scrutiny for what could be a common or minor error.\n* If deemed necessary through the recommendation of the review committee, the DAO can vote via Snapshot on whether or not the violation constitutes a DAO ban. Delegates can reference the\u00a0[Furucombo instance](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x07bea6e32d32b4d3ed20faec6950c3546e2319bc2497716c53ee05995d4a00eb)\u00a0as an example.\n* In every case, the Arbitrum Foundation will determine if legal recourse is viable. This will be dependent on the size of funds involved in the misuse and legal jurisdiction of the accused party.\n\n**4. Reward Mechanism**\n\n* If the review committee deems a report valid at their discretion, they will determine what level of misuse. A certain level of subjectivity has been introduced due to the wide range of programs that the Watchdog program will cover. A mix of factors will be taken into account the level of severity. These include, but are not limited to the total amount of funds involved, how the funds were used (ex. simple error or intentional fraud), if the misuse is rectifiable, and/or the level of damage to the Arbitrum ecosystem/brand.\n* A fixed reward has been included to ensure that an incentive always exists for community members and individuals to submit reports. The base payouts denominated in ARB will come from the approved Watchdog budget. If funds are able to be recovered, the watcher that submitted the report will receive 5% of the funds, capped with a USD amount depending on the severity. The base ARB payout will be deducted from the overall amount. Base payouts and reward caps are as follows:\n  * **Low:**\u00a01k ARB base payout deducted from recovered funds if applicable. Total possible reward is capped at $10k.\n  * **Medium:**\u00a010k ARB base payout deducted from recovered funds if applicable. Total possible reward is capped at $25k.\n  * **High:**\u00a030k ARB base payout deducted from recovered funds if applicable. Total possible reward is capped at $100k.\n* If recaptured funds are denominated in a volatile asset, the maximum reward awarded to the watcher will be calculated as the 30D TWAP of the underlying asset on the day the transfer is made. The reward will be paid out in the recovered asset. If the recovered asset is ARB, it will be used to replenish the Watchdog\u2019s available budget up to 400k ARB. Any excess ARB or other assets recovered will be returned to the DAO\u2019s treasury or the Arbitrum Foundation depending on the source of the original grant.\n* The reviewing committee composed of Entropy Advisors, the Arbitrum Foundation, and SeedGov reserve the right to adjust the base payout and reward structure. This flexibility will allow for adjustments to be made in the event of major changes to market conditions or evidence that the proposed structure is not adequately incentivizing watchers.\n* While anyone is encouraged to submit reports, only watchers that complete a KYC with the Foundation will be eligible for rewards.\n\nWe believe that this mechanism is optimal for the time being, but once OpCo is stood up, it is our recommendation that the program be moved into its domain. If done so, the reviewing mechanism will likely be restructured.\n\nThe program will run until the 400K ARB is exhausted from valid misuse reports. If the budget falls below 100k ARB before the program is moved to OpCo, Entropy Advisors will notify the DAO and potentially put forward a proposal to extend the budget.\n\nBefore moving the program under the domain of OpCo or 6 months post program launch, whichever occurs first, Entropy Advisors will provide a retrospective report to help evaluate the successfulness of the Watchdog. The report will summarize the received misuse cases along with data such as total amount of misuse, severity breakdowns, and amount of ARB recovered.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nAfter the Watchdog program passed on Snapshot, Entropy began contacting potential providers in order to solicit bids for a dedicated portal. As shared in Entropy\u2019s February\u00a0[monthly update](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-monthly-update-february-2025/28646), following discussions with\u00a0[@JoJo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo)\u00a0and the Arbitrum Foundation, it was determined that introducing a separate portal introduced unnecessary fragmentation and Entropy believed there was an opportunity to combine the creation of the Watchdog site with a larger Arbitrum branded grants portal, an idea expressed originally in our\u00a0[voting rationale](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-rfc-arbitrum-d-a-o-domain-allocator-offerings-grant-program-season-3/27584/130)\u00a0for Season 3 of the D.A.O program. Through the end of February and most of March, Entropy explored this idea with several different providers and development teams.\n\nDuring these discussions, it became clear that such a portal would be a several month endeavor, so to not delay the Watchdog program any further, Entropy explored a few open source whistleblower software solutions and concluded that\u00a0[GlobaLeaks](https://www.globaleaks.org/)\u00a0is the best option for a temporary grant misuse portal.\n\nFor those not familiar with GlobaLeaks, it is an open-source whistleblowing platform used by governments, NGOs, and investigative journalists. A dedicated submission portal can be deployed by the Arbitrum Foundation on a VPS to enable secure & anonymous submissions. For the Watchdog program, it is a free option that supports the submission and review of grant misuse reports, offers end-to-end encryption, includes a reviewer dashboards, and has optional Tor access for sleuths looking to maximize their privacy.\n\nFor the time being, we believe a GlobaLeaks portal is a sufficient temporary option for the Watchdog and can be simply linked on the Foundation\u2019s grant page. If the program is successful and the larger Arbitrum grants portal comes to fruition, the Watchdog program can easily be transferred over.\n\n## Budget\n\n400,000 ARB will be sent to a new Arbitrum Foundation controlled\u00a0[address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9Cfcf93dC53dF1C7986eB5ec3CF07A234d94b635). These funds will be used to reward valid Watchdog reports and pay SeedGov.\n\n## Updated Timeline\n\nMay 8th - 22nd: Onchain Vote\n\nEnd of May: Program is launched"

    "description": "# Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program\nTL;DR : This proposal aims to support the budding RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum by diversifying 35 million ARB from our treasury into assets that are stable in value with minimal volatility, liquid in conversion and provide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \"risk free rate of return\" of US Treasuries (hereby called \u2018stable RWAs\u2019)\n\nThis proposal is a trial run for a larger investment policy of the ArbitrumDAO treasury, both in\n\n1. Creating a legal and infrastructural pipeline that future diversification proposals can take guidance from and\n2. Proof of concept that we can diversify our treasury in a way that supports ecosystem growth\n\nThis is NOT a grant; it is an investment that Arbitrum governance can exercise control over and recall, subject to agreed-upon conditions with successful applicants.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) is the first proposal floated by the Treasury WG before the DAO. We are targeting stable RWAs backed by t-bills or money market instruments as the 1st step towards larger treasury diversification for several reasons\n\n1. Our conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product. Another way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum, with the added advantage that it\u2019s in the form of an investment we earn yield from and can recall at anytime, rather than a grant. More generally, stable RWAs have an attractive risk-reward ratio for Arbitrum in terms of sectors we should be nurturing. The total US treasury market is over $20 trillion, some of which is expected to come onchain to satisfy demand from wealthy investors. As the home of De-Fi, we should not cede space to\u00a0[Base](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/12/coinbase-debuts-rwa-platform-built-on-base-under-abu-dhabi-regulators-oversight/)\u00a0or\u00a0[Mantle](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd)\u00a0that have their own RWA support programs.&#x20;\n2. The stable coins we use today in De-Fi are mostly backed by t-bill RWAs. Creating our own exposure can increase capital efficiency and mitigate risk. Although protocols on Arbitrum and governance might wish to hold stable RWAs, they are limited by having to conduct due diligence on providers they can trust. This proposal creates a qualified  committee that evaluates applicants and prepares an Assessment Report on them, providing a roster of vetted service providers that anyone can use for investing assets into RWAs on Arbitrum.&#x20;\n\nIn conclusion, we expect that lessons learned from implementation of this proposal can pave the way for a new form of an ecosystem support program, where the ArbitrumDAO supports projects not with grants but purchases of financial products built on our chain that also diversify our treasury holdings.\n\n### Timeline and Procedure\n\n1. Snapshot temperature check ([COMPLETE](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5050ef61a4cbff56344ad558c2c880b547fef3b81df607818238ed3031f840b3))\n2. Screening committee publishes RFP with specific information requested from applicants and minimum criteria they must satisfy to be considered (COMPLETE)\n3. Onchain Tally vote (March 20th to April 3rd)\n4. Receive applications from service providers (submission window April 5th to May 5th );\n5. Committee reviews each application, and where needed, conduct additional due diligence and research (May 5th to June 5th)\n6. Snapshot vote for approval of recommended allocations between service providers (June 20th)\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. The Arbitrum foundation will act as the legal entity and face the service provider during the KYC process. They shall also hold any tokens/NFTs received in exchange of investments and have authority to withdraw assets from the service provider should any risks be discovered; however an explanation for the same shall be posted on the forum within 3 days of taking such an action. They will also periodically sweep interest earned from these assets to our treasury. Fire Drills will be periodically conducted to test solvency and clear out any AML delays in returning investments\n2. Interest earned from RWAs will be swept to our treasury for increasing our bridged USDC holdings (currently at 10 cents). For reference, $20 million in t-bills currently returns roughly $1 million in annual interest. Delay of more than 60 days in returning interest earned will result in liquidation of an investment from a service provider.\n3. Proposals to utilize interest earned will follow the same process as requesting funds from the treasury\n4. The committee will comprise of 6 members: Karpatkey, GFX Labs Steakhouse Financial, Nethermind and North Lake Legal, & the Treasury WG acting as facilitator and tie-breaking vote\n   * **Karpatkey** is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We\u2019ve been working with GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW Protocol, and Lido on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions.\n   * **GFX Labs** is the leading provider of professional governance services in DeFi. We are most known for our extensive past and present contributions at Uniswap, MakerDAO, Compound, and Optimism. GFX focuses on operational improvements and improving organizational quality and structure, with strong relevant experience in real-world asset onboarding and stablecoins.\n   * **Steakhouse Financial** is the leading CFO-as-a-service consulting company for DAOs. We specialize in stablecoins and RWAs. Our team has been merging TradFi and DeFi for years \u2013 our team met as contributors to the Strategic Finance Core Unit at MakerDAO. We\u2019ve contributed extensively to asset-liability management research and structuring MakerDAOs RWA portfolio, including its exposure to treasuries. We specialize in deep due-diligence reports of tokenized issuers and publish the leading research report and Dune dashboards covering the space\u00a0<https://dune.com/steakhouse/tokenized-securities>\n   * **Nethermind**\u00a0is a blockchain research and software engineering company empowering enterprises and developers worldwide to work with and build upon decentralized systems. Our work touches every part of the Web3 ecosystem, from fundamental cryptography research to security, node infrastructure, DeFi, and application-layer protocol development.

Nethermind is a key contributor to the development of Ethereum, with our execution client representing over a quarter of all synced nodes. Additionally, we actively build the Starknet ecosystem and support our institutional and enterprise partners in advanced blockchain, digital assets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) fields.\n   * **North Lakes Legal** is a law firm at the leading edge of bridging decentralized finance, DAOs and Real World Assets. North Lakes Legal implemented the standards for the initial high-profile real- world asset (\u201cRWA\u201d) financings in the DeFi space. Christian Petersen is the principal of North Lakes Legal and has 26 years of cross border project and structured finance experience. In support of Maker DAO, North Lakes Legal has structured, negotiated, and implemented the following:\n     * Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale \u2013 DAI 40 million, tokenized French covered bonds\n     * Huntingdon Valley Bank \u2013 DAI 100 million vault to acquire RWA loan participations\n     * BlockTower Credit \u2013 DAI 150 million vault utilizing Tinlake for various RWAs\n     * Monetalis Clydesdale \u2013 DAI 500 million to acquire U.S. treasury ETF\n     * Most recently, North Lakes Legal advised Ondo Finance in the development, structuring and launch of Ondo USDY.\n   * [**Arbitrum Treasury WG**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-working-group/18978) as a facilitating, nonvoting member except in case of a tie.\n5. The Assessment Report prepared by the committee will contain a recommended division of the sanctioned amount between service providers, which the DAO can approve or reject via Snapshot vote. Other details in the Assessment Report include schedule for returning interest, relationship with Arbitrum (debtor or custodian), maturation period of asset, legal structure (bankruptcy remote assessment), solvency, Arbitrum alignment, turnaround time for returning investment, transparency level (proof of reserves/read only access to accounts), and fees charged.\n6. 300,000 ARB for implementation of this proposal; unused funds returned to treasury\n\nAnticipated expenditures include\n\n* 150,000 ARB between 6 committee members (25k ARB per committee member is equivalent to the LTIPP Grants Council members)\n* 50,000 ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation for payment of outside legal counsel\n* 100,000 ARB for additional due diligence required by the committee and to program manager for management oversight and monitoring of selected providers.\n  **Candidates for STEP Program Manager will be selected by a vote of the**\u00a0[**procurement committee**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064), valid for a period of one year, after which they need to return to the DAO for a vote on paying their retainer fees. In case they do not get approval and there is no program manager overseeing our investments, the Arbitrum Foundation will liquidate and return assets to the treasury\n\nDuties of the program manager in the pre-allocation phase, for which we received a quotation of $1000 per application, include:\n\n1. Receiving applications from service providers\n2. Conduct a first pass on applications received; filter out incomplete applications or those not fitting the RFP\n3. After the committee reviews valid applications and shortlists eligible providers, prepare an assessment report on each provider that allows for easy comparison between them\n\nPost allocation duties, for which we received a quotation of $100,000 per year plus $15k for every selected provider, include;\n\n**1. Cashflow & Accrual Monitoring:**\u00a0Enable the Arbitrum Foundation to easily ensure that the Arbitrum Treasury receives timely payments or accruals. If payments are delayed or incongruent with stated rates, Arbitrum can take appropriate action (e.g. inquiry, divestment, etc). Specific functionality includes:\n\n* Initial capital contribution and redemption tracking\n* Track and notify interest accrual or payment amounts for each investment\n* Ensure expected interest accrual or payment frequencies match service providers\u2019 documentation\n\n**2. Underlying Asset Monitoring:**\u00a0Validate that service providers are investing in expected underlying assets and risk exposures. If nonstandard assets are being included in a provider\u2019s portfolio, Arbitrum will be informed and can take appropriate action.\n\n* Report on service providers\u2019 underlying assets and reserves\n* Provide portfolio statistics and risk analytics\n* Report % of product AUM that pertains to Arbitrum\u2019s investment\n\n**3. Operations & Counterparty Monitoring:**\u00a0Aggregates nonquantitative information to regularly inform Arbitrum of key structural information and material document changes and administer redemption tests.\n\n* Collate service provider financial and audit reports\n* Track underlying service provider changes (e.g. custodian or broker changes, change in 3rd party auditors)\n* Track material changes in provider terms\n* Administer Redemption Tests (i.e. \u201cFire Drills\u201d) to test for provider redemption timeliness.\n* Communication with the DAO on the governance forum for questions pertaining to the program\n* Any other duties that may arise which are necessary for success\n\n7\\.

Supplementary\n\n**Summary and Arbitrum info**\n\n**Introduction**\nArbitrum governance is seeking proposals from qualified applicants for the purposes of diversifying the governance treasury and supporting ecosystem growth.\n\nThe purpose of the RFP is to identify products that provide trading volume and depth (i.e., liquidity), are stable in value, produce income for governance independent of crypto market volatility, offer transparency, and can potentially see use in developing a nascent \u201creal-world assets\u201d sector on Arbitrum chains.\n\nApplicants whose products meet certain quality thresholds will be presented to ARB holders and their delegates for possible asset allocation. All final asset allocation decisions rest with ARB holders and their representatives. This RFP is intended to both collect relevant information for the committee and also to recommend allocations for tokenholders to vote upon.\n\n**Requester background**\n\nArbitrum governance maintains and upgrades the Arbitrum technology stack, upon which are built multiple blockchains, including the largest Layer 2 on Ethereum, with more than $2.8b in assets onchain.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Asset information**\n\nThis program is intended to convert 35,000,000 ARB into stable, liquid and yield earning assets. The dollar notional amount of this investment is subject to market volatility, but at the time of February 9, 2024, is valued at approximately $66,000,000. These assets do not have a specific futured obligation or liability they are matched against. The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands legal entity, will be the transacting counterparty.\n\n**Oversight**\n\nThe committee is comprised of 6 members including GFX Labs, Steakhouse Financial, Karpatkey, Nethermind, and North Lakes Legal. The Arbitrum Treasury & Sustainability Working Group also serves as a non-voting member of the committee, except in the case of ties.\n\nAll members are required to recuse themselves for any application in which they have a monetary interest, direct or indirect.\n\nThe Arbitrum Treasury & Sustainability Working Group leads this process, and answers to stakeholders within Arbitrum governance.\n\n**Scope of service/criteria**\n\nPlease include the following as part of your proposal:\nSample or template investment contract and the governing instrument (credit agreement, partnership agreement, etc.).\nInvestment selection, monitoring, and reporting plan.\nCompliance requirements.

    "description": "# ARB Staking: Unlock ARB Utility and Align Governance\n## [](#p-52947-constitutional-non-constitutional-1)Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nConstitutional\n\n*\\* Please note that, while the ARB Staking proposal as a whole is constitutional, this onchain proposal targets the Treasury Governor because it controls the ARB treasury.* &#x20;\n\n## [](#p-52947-abstract-2)Abstract\n\nWe propose to unlock ARB utility and improve the governance and security of the Arbitrum protocol by implementing ARB staking, without yet turning on fee distribution to token holders. Through ARB staking, token holders who delegate to active governance participants will be able to capture value. The proposal will also implement a liquid staked ARB token (stARB) via the Tally Protocol that enables any future rewards to auto-compound, is (re)stakeable, and is compatible with DeFi. Separately, we will work with the Arbitrum DAO to decide whether and how to fund rewards and split rewards between token holders and delegates.\n\n## [](#p-52947-motivation-3)Motivation\n\nThe ARB token is struggling to accrue value.\n\n* Governance power is the only source of fundamental demand for ARB, while there are multiple sources of new supply (unlocks, treasury spending).\n* The ability to restake ARB or use it on DeFi is not compatible with governance. Voting power breaks when ARB is deposited into smart contracts. [Less than 1%](https://dune.com/queries/3732998/6278607) of ARB tokens are used actively in the onchain ecosystem.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/36330652-45ac-4d38-b352-1b1598e84c95_original.png)\n\nThe ARB token is struggling as a governance mechanism\n\n* Only about 10% of the circulating supply of ARB is [actively used](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates) in governance\n* Voter participation in the DAO has been [steadily declining](https://dune.com/queries/3829223/6440489) since DAO launch\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/18155bf2-6c43-4e4d-a386-ac4136f0e3d1_original.png)\n\nMeanwhile, the Arbitrum DAO treasury has accumulated over [16 Million $ETH](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury) in surplus fees from Arbitrum One and Nova. As a result, it is becoming economically attractive for a malicious actor to launch a governance attack on the DAO treasury. The potential profit of attacking the DAO treasury is increasing as more ETH accumulates in the treasury, while the cost of attacking the DAO through purchasing ARB for its voting power is not increasing proportionally to defend against attacks. A more developed version of this dynamic exists in the ENS and Compound DAOs, both of which are actively fighting off governance attacks (ENS documented [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/10)).\n\nARB Staking unlocks utility and aligns governance by creating a mechanism to stream future rewards from DAO-generated sources like sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification to token holders who are delegated to an active governance participant. ARB Staking makes ARB usable in restaking and DeFi by returning voting power locked in contracts to the DAO.\n\n## [](#p-52947-rationale-4)Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure.\n\n## [](#p-52947-specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5)Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\n### [](#p-52947-system-architecture-6)System architecture\n\nARB Staking enables ARB utility while allowing the DAO to retain governance power. It includes a few modular components that come together to power the system.\n\nGovernance Staking\n\n* Requires that tokens are delegated to an active delegate in order to be eligible to receive rewards (see Karma Integration)\n* Accepts arbitrary fee sources as rewards\n* Is based on Uniswaps audited [UniStaker](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker). Each pool of staked tokens are held in their own special purpose smart contract which can only delegate its own voting power. The governance contract is simple, permissionless, audited and has no special authorities. The contract is upgradable only via Constitutional Proposal by the Arbitrum DAO.\n* Each user owns their own staking vault, and is free to use Governance Staking regardless of whether or not they use stARB (see Tally Protocol LST section below). This allows for maximum flexibility for the DAO and lets others also build yield generating infrastructure for the ARB token.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/044f363e-3ac1-4402-8264-d68b77da5dc6_original.png)\n\nThe DAO\n\n* Has the power to turn on fee distribution and send fees to ARB Staking\n* Controls how voting power is distributed to delegates, including delegation strategies for unused voting power\n\nstARB (Tally Protocol LST)\n\n* Creates a *receipt token* for the ARB which is staked through it, called stARB, and it returns it to the user. The underlying tokens that are staked on the users behalf are always available to redeem, 1:1 plus rewards if applicable, at any time.\n* Auto-compounds potential rewards if they are turned on in the future\n* Provides token holders a liquid position\n* Administers its own Governance Staking vault, not any other vault. stARB has no special powers over the staking contract, and has no access to user\u2019s tokens other than the tokens it manages itself.\n* Will be deployed as an immutable, non-upgradeable contract. The delegation strategies part of the system will upgradeable via Arbitrum DAO Constitutional Proposal. The only part of the system Tally manages is the rebalancing of underlying assets.\n* Can have a withdrawal period, which is configurable by the DAO. The expectation is that any withdrawal period will be very short and is there only to prevent people from abusing the reward mechanism (i.e. staking right before a reward, claiming a chunk of it, and immediately unstaking). If there is a price difference, arbitrageurs can instantly unstake stARB and sell it as ARB to close the price difference. This easy arbitrage opportunity minimizes price discrepancies and makes it difficult for any potential governance attacker to acquire ARB at a discount.\n* Allows stARB holders to continue delegating directly to their preferred delegate.\n* Has the ability to return voting power to the DAO if stARB is deposited into restaking, DeFi, or centralized exchange smart contracts that do not maintain a 1:1 delegation relationship by implementing a [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) client. The Arbitrum DAO exclusively has the ability to determine how this voting power is distributed/redelegated via a governance proposal. The DAO will decide how to set up the initial redelegation logic for stARB.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/bdb099d8-154c-4a6c-b9e7-675c2b438159_original.png)\n\n### [](#p-52947-karma-integration-7)Karma integration\n\nGovernance Staking requires that tokens are delegated to an active delegate in order to be eligible to receive rewards. We will define an \u201cactive delegate\u201d using Karma Score. The implementation of Karma for ARB Staking is designed to be modular. If, in the future, the DAO wishes to add additional or alternative providers to define \u201cactive delegate\u201d, it can do so. The DAO will define the Karma Score requirement for being considered an active delegate. Karma Score is a combination of delegate\u2019s Snapshot voting stats, onchain voting stats and their forum activity. To accurately calculate forum activity score, delegates are required to prove ownership of their forum handle by [signing a message](https://www.karmahq.xyz/dao/link/forum?dao=arbitrum) with their delegate address and posting on the forum. The current Karma score formula is below, which can be adjusted by the DAO going forward:\n\n((100) \\* ((Forum Activity Score \\* 1) + (Off-chain Votes % \\* 3) + (On-chain Votes % \\* 5))) / (Sum of Weights times Max Score Setting \\* 1)\n\nKarma Score will be included in ARB staking via a smart contract that writes data onchain from the Karma API. We will include several guardrails to ensure that this aspect of the implementation is robust and decentralized:\n\n* Users can verify Karma score calculations independently.\n* The DAO will have the ability to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly.\n* If Karma scores fail to arrive or the scores are blocked by the DAO, ARB Staking will distribute rewards to all stakers regardless of whether they are delegated to an active governance participant until the situation is resolved.\n\nIn the future, we believe it would make sense to integrate delegate incentives with ARB staking so that, instead of getting delegate incentive funds from the ARB treasury, they come directly from onchain revenue. We will lead a working group to develop a recommendation on this topic.\n\nTally will build ARB staking into our existing [Arbitrum DAO platform](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), so that users can easily stake and delegate in one place.\n\n### [](#p-52947-parallel-workstreams-staking-rewards-and-delegation-working-groups-8)Parallel workstreams: Staking Rewards and Delegation working groups\n\nIn parallel with the development of ARB Staking, we will lead two separate DAO working groups that are focused on aspects of the system that will be implemented after development is complete.\n\n* The Staking Rewards working group will focus on how to fund staking rewards. It will develop a recommendation about whether staking rewards should be funded by sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, treasury diversification, and/or DAO venture investments and how to implement such rewards.\n* The ARB Staking & Delegation working group will focus on how to define an active contributor to the Arbitrum DAO, delegate incentives, and voting power distribution. It will collaborate with Tally and Karma to develop recommendations on Karma Score formula, the minimum Karma Score required to be eligible for staking.\n\nThe working groups will be formed via an open call for contributors that will be posted after this proposal passes the temp check stage. Each working group will deliver their recommendations in October, so that the recommendations can be turned into DAO proposals and created following the implementation of ARB Staking.\n\n### [](#p-52947-integration-with-future-arbitrum-staking-systems-9)Integration with future Arbitrum staking systems\n\nWe anticipate that multiple Arbitrum staking systems will be developed over time, perhaps to incentivize decentralized block production in BoLD or to create an efficient MEV market in Time Boost. We view multiple staking systems as complementary. Each system would ask the staker to do different work for Arbitrum, take different risks, and pay out different rewards. Having multiple systems lets ARB holders pick between different risk/reward payoffs and specialize in different types of work to secure the system.\n\n## [](#p-52947-estimated-timeline-10)Estimated Timeline\n\nPost proposal on forum for feedback: June\n\nPost temp check proposal on Snapshot: August\n\nPost onchain proposal on Tally for funding: August\n\nBegin development: August\n\nSubmit smart contracts for audit: September\n\nSubmit onchain proposal on Tally including full ARB Staking implementation: October\n\nPublish working group recommendations and turn them into DAO proposals: November\n\n## [](#p-52947-overall-cost-11)Overall Cost\n\nIf this proposal passes temperature check, we will submit an onchain proposal that includes $200,000 USD in ARB of funding to cover the costs of development, including the following funding categories:\n\n$50,000 USD in ARB: Develop ARB Staking smart contracts\n\n* Implement staking contracts\n* Integrate Arbitrum\u2019s current and potential fee mechanisms\n* Integrate Karma Score requirement\n* Enable the DAO to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly\n\n$20,000 USD in ARB: Integrate ARB Staking into Tally.xyz\n\n$50,000 USD in ARB: Integrate Karma into ARB Staking\nDevelop and deploy a smart contract to store key stats and Karma scores onchain\n\n* Create a system to record stats onchain and store detailed delegate data off-chain (using Arweave or IPFS) for easy verification\n* Continuously improve scoring algorithms to adapt to evolving Arbitrum community needs\n* Provide technical support to delegates experiencing issues with their statistics\n\n$60,000 USD in ARB: Audit ARB Staking smart contracts\n\n* The final cost of the audit including documentation will be published on this thread.

    "description": "# UPDATED - Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks funding from the Arbitrum DAO to support an Attackathon, a large-scale security audit event hosted by the Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi. The Attackathon will focus on securing the Ethereum protocol with three key phases: education, active bug hunting, and result evaluation. The initiative aims to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation. This effort is crucial for ensuring Ethereum\u2019s stability, which is vital to maintaining the reliability of projects on Arbitrum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs a Layer 2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum is directly dependent on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Given that Arbitrum is EVM-compatible, any vulnerabilities in Ethereum could potentially impact Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem. This Attackathon is particularly timely given the recent major Ethereum hard forks, which have introduced new code that requires careful auditing.\n\nAdditionally, the Attackathon will include an educational program featuring live technical walkthroughs and detailed documentation from Ethereum Foundation, client teams, Solidity developers, and Immunefi. This program will cater to security researchers at all levels, helping to build a stronger security community around both Ethereum and Arbitrum. The increased awareness and participation in Ethereum\u2019s security will ultimately benefit Arbitrum by ensuring a more secure underlying infrastructure.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Attackathon aligns with Arbitrum\u2019s mission to support a secure and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. By contributing to this initiative, Arbitrum will directly enhance Ethereum\u2019s security, which supports the reliability of Arbitrum. Moreover, the educational component will upskill security researchers, giving them the tools to audit and secure both the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum will benefit from increased visibility as a proactive participant in Ethereum security efforts, enhancing its credibility and reputation among developers, users, and security researchers. By sponsoring the Attackathon, Arbitrum positions itself as a leader in the ecosystem, contributing to long-term sustainability and security.\n\n## Detailed Financial Justification\n\nThe goal of securing $2M in total funding aligns with other major security audits in the blockchain ecosystem. Comparable initiatives include:\n\n* MakerDAO contest on Sherlock: $1.35M\n* Euler contest on Cantina: $1.25M\n* Uniswap v4 contest on Cantina: $2.35M\n* Firedancer contest on Immunefi: $1M\n\nThe Attackathon funding goal reflects the importance of thoroughly securing Ethereum\u2019s core protocol. With $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation, additional sponsorship from ArbitrumDAO will help us reach this $2M target, ensuring participation from top-tier security researchers and maximizing the event\u2019s impact.\n\n## Outcome Metrics\n\nBy setting clear goals for participation, reports submitted, and transparency, we can effectively track the impact of the Attackathon. Key outcome metrics include:\n\n* Secure over 100 security researcher signups before the program's launch.\n* Achieve participation from over 100 distinct individuals submitting reports.\n* Submit more than 150 reports by the conclusion of the Attackathon.\n* Publish an audit-style report summarizing findings for the Arbitrum and Ethereum communities.\n\nThese metrics will demonstrate the program's effectiveness in attracting top security talent and identifying critical vulnerabilities across both ecosystems.\n\n## Community Feedback Loop\n\nTo ensure transparency and alignment with community expectations, we will provide regular updates on the Attackathon\u2019s progress through Arbitrum forums and governance channels. These updates will include detailed reports on fund usage, security vulnerabilities identified, and overall outcomes. Community feedback will be encouraged through these platforms to maintain alignment with the community\u2019s goals and priorities.\n\n## Breakdown of Expenditures\n\n100% of the funds raised from the ArbitrumDAO and other sponsors will be allocated to security researcher payouts based on the severity of the bugs they find. Immunefi has waived their usual fees for this event, so all funds will be directly used for researcher rewards. If any funds remain after the Attackathon, they will be rolled over to an audit contest focused on securing the Pecta hardfork.\n\n## Estimated Timeline\n\n* **November 20**: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff\n* **November 27**: Attackathon hunting begins\n* **January 22**: Attackathon concludes and results compilation begins\n* **January 23**: Review period begins\n* **Late March**: Results announced\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is invited to sponsor the Attackathon with a\u00a0**30 ETH commitment**. This sponsorship includes:\n\n* 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\n* Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page\n* Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\n* An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program\n* 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO had previously signalled its support via a [temperature check on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x29c7eb60e1ed122f81aa5f4caeb5d171b27ae644666ad18aece78ff28d7b9245) with a 30 ETH sponsorship for the Attackathon via the Panda Partnerships tier.\n\nBy supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum will leverage the event\u2019s findings to ensure its network remains secure and robust.

These are: an effective knowledge base, investment frameworks, and a committed team of experts. We\u2019ll align with DAO budgeting and strategic objectives, building on existing work and GCP learnings as a proof of concept.\nThe result will be capture-resilient to any one party\u2019s interests and aligned with DAO governance best practices.\n\nThe execution of the work scoped in this pilot will lead to a specific proposal for the setup & funding of the Ecosystem Fund (or to smaller proposals for allocating capital to specific targets building up to it). Scope:\n\n1. Funding Ecosystem Health Report\n2. Ecosystem Investment Thesis & Strategy\n3. Strategic Recommendations\n\n## Motivation\n\nAfter observing the investment and venture challenges faced by the DAO, its builders, and investors, we need the Arbitrum Ecosystem Fund as a bold and decisive initiative. The significant opportunity cost requires quick action for AVI to produce actionable thesis, strategy, and recommendations. These will empower delegates and groups to make effective decisions, tackling the risks of an otherwise incongruent, piecemeal approach. A lean and pragmatic pilot will address these outcomes in the short term, incl. in relation to live proposals, while demonstrating the viability of a more holistic long term structure and laying a solid foundation for it.\n\n## Rationale\n\nArbitrum is already a highly desirable platform by engineers and a market leader. In order to continue to thrive, the DAO needs to double down on betting on these builders that are growing the ecosystem and expanding the sequencer volumes. Doing so in alignment with treasury sustainability, budgeting, and strategic goals, including increasing protocol revenues, diversifying revenue streams, and opening new markets.\n\nSince AVI started there has been a lot of interest from a broad spectrum of builders and investors. We have seen a growing number of proposals in this category, however selecting the correct mix of solutions, funding them, and ensuring accountability to the ecosystem has proven challenging. Thus AVI is focused on rapidly producing actionable outputs, while unlocking a variety of tactical steps for the DAO.\n\nOutputs:\n\n1. Enable Arbitrum to make the next step towards developing a best-in-class approach to a DAO-led Ecosystem Investment Fund in Web3 including a proposal for its further structure and deployment.\n2. Rigorous understanding of Arbitrum environment, including:\n   1. Funding gaps\n   2. Opportunities outlined by investors\n   3. Free market capital that can be mobilized\n   4. Live proposals for venture initiatives (e.g. BoB, SC, etc)\n3. Develop an Ecosystem Investment Thesis, Strategy, and Recommendations aligned with Arbitrum's long term goals to create a unified vision within the DAO on best practices for fostering a thriving venture ecosystem\n4. Develop an Ops plan for applying the Ecosystem Investment Thesis, Strategy, and Recommendations\n5. Community engagement for DAO accountability and transparency:\n   1. Evaluating approaches for community engagement in the work of the unit\n   2. Running engagement sessions with educational outcomes on key concepts\n   3. Ensured coordination with the work of other relevant groups\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Deliverables\n\n**Market Consultation Report** (State of Venture in the Arbitrum Ecosystem)\n\n* Discovery summary\n* Deck for Market Consultation\n* Consultation Schedule of 45+ participants (incl. groups that have made proposals to the DAO)\n* Anonymised data\n* Findings and summary\n\n**Thesis and Strategy Report for Investment and Venture Fund**\n\n* Types of funds, instruments, and initiatives to target (venture funds, accelerators, incubators, venture studios, etc.)\n* Development of foundational hypothesis for key strategic sectors for growth, investee profiles across multiple stages of maturity, and which markets and trends to focus on (integrated with active work of other working groups)\n* Portfolio construction\n* Evaluation frameworks for funds and initiatives (initial version)\n* Evaluation frameworks for Ecosystem Fund's - Impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem and long-term value creation (initial version)\n\n**Set of Strategic Recommendations**\n\n* Roadmap for the next AVI phases (considering emerging constraints and synergetic structures and work groups)\n* Analysis of strategic investment priorities and steps for fund deployment (building on Areta\u2019s M\\&A Pilot)\n* Specific analyzed target deals\n\n**A detailed operational plan for the next phase of the Arbitrum Venture Initiative**\n\n* Timeline and milestones for key activities and deliverables\n* Resource allocation and team roles\n* Budget breakdown for next phases with an overall target allocation for Arbitrum having been considered\n\n**Community Engagement Report**\n\n* Recordings of engagement and educational events\n* Decks, Miro boards, and workshop summaries\n* Participation of AVI team in sessions opened by other working groups\n* Proactive engagement with relevant groups (GCP, M\\&A, DAO Budgeting, etc) to include their inputs on thesis, operations and legal\n* Findings on activities and formats producing valuable inputs for venture thesis development, strategy, and execution\n* Key learnings embedded for future community engagement to maintain transparency\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n1. **Proactive engagement and alignment with other working groups and streams including:**\n   1. DAO Budgeting\n   2. Treasury Management\n   3. GCP\n   4. M\\&A\n2. **Full alignment with legal structures and frameworks:**\n   1. GCP legal umbrella setup\n3. **Governance considerations:**\n   1. Top level oversight and control should be based on a committee with roles elected by the DAO\n   2. DAO votes should be triggered for decisions with high material impact like additional capital allocation, liquidating the structure, or actions outside the approved mandate for the roles above\n4. **Best practices on DAO engagement**\n   1. Transparency\n   2. Accountability\n   3. Participatory design (where feasible)\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nTo kick off working towards the Ecosystem Fund, we\u2019re proposing the initial phase that includes:\n\n1. **Creating the State of Arbitrum\u2019s Venture Ecosystem Report** to surface valuable insights from the community, bringing all stakeholders up to speed. This report will highlight successful initiatives and uncover gaps through dozens of discovery and market consultation interviews.\n2. **Building a Thesis and Strategy Report** for Investment and Venture fund set-up in the Arbitrum Ecosystem where we explore funds, instruments, and initiatives to target (venture funds, accelerators, incubators, venture studios, etc.), develop the foundational hypotheses for key strategic growth sectors and markets, and explore portfolio construction and evaluation frameworks.\n3. Leveraging these reports, we\u2019ll produce a **set of strategic recommendations and proposal** for AVI to set up the initial iteration of the Ecosystem Fund to manage investment allocations, funding proposals, structuring deals, and managing the outcomes with the likes of RnDAO, EVM Capital, Outlier Ventures, Elixir Capital, and the relevant accelerators coming from ThankARB\u2019s RFP programs. It is intended to be structured as a Fund of Funds, resilient to capture by any one group\u2019s special interests.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, we are bringing a team with deep expertise in investment (including a decade in web3), early-stage and growth builders, and ecosystem building around frontier technologies, with 100s of millions deployed, billions in exits, and intimate knowledge of Arbitrum. Profiles are outlined on the forum and Snapshot proposal.\n\n**Core Full time team**\n\nLino & Ana\n\n**Subject-matter experts:**\n\nPaul, Konstantina, Joseph \\[Immutable Lawyer], Anish, Bart\n\n**DAO representative:**\n\nAlex Lumley\n\n## Timeline\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfl_9urpiYt_RYAVg1_rGh6Fd2oOkzgwge1fjirZyybRUs15QEOIPq6HAYmRg-kBQnC3zne7SamtTHDsuvBe2GMnWD4QrTDCk14LqhMnKgvGrNePS3pGwC9nOXZywGoIravo66Q20FBz9iibPc-JqVpuqJj?key=TBYl9rDlOsW_Ldf8hOk9hA \"gantt\")\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd_rbFVgD9Q15bopYqhSLTScKwO5Sga90mog-c-eltOHB9keQMbyZwvHePknjTwibZEVnjKnjB0rK_oN4mS8u8LGWjD3TKCQjJ_gCdr24vP17WLItfQ1tTMMzLT67C1YvFdCPuo7u9fEqbLaM1nNDvGCMo?key=TBYl9rDlOsW_Ldf8hOk9hA \"budget\")\n\n#### Total - **$87,000.00**\n\nArb to be transferred to a Safe MSig (arb1:0x9271A08958C0406F59fc0E0510141563A2FFcD28) composed of the following signers:\n\n* Lino Velev: arb1:0xFf46A0dF4fB1729679420D71089a7dcc16C7fFad\n* Ana-Maria Yanakieva: arb1:0xbE6fE3cE690b8B2e86FA2d4B358386d2211feE1A\n* Alex Lumley: arb1:0xA9cD2D7Fe90321BadD16ebf6b5dB7A6Be099ef2E\n\nThe ARB amount to be transfered is based on the USD equivalent at time of submission with a 35% buffer.

    "description": "# Double-Down on STIP Successes (STIP-Bridge)\n![]()**Abstract**![]()\n\nThis proposal introduces the STIP Bridge, aiming to sustain and enhance Arbitrum\u2019s market leadership by extending support to key protocols amidst intense competition from other Layer 2 solutions. It serves as a strategic interim solution, maintaining incentive alignment and ensuring continuous engagement of vital projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem until the Perpetual Incentives Program is initiated.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is currently facing unprecedented competitive pressures, with significant incentive programs launched by rival Layer 2 networks threatening to attract our established protocols away. The STIP Bridge is crucial for retaining these integral projects, ensuring they remain committed to Arbitrum by providing timely, targeted incentives. This initiative is essential to preserve network growth, user engagement, and overall ecosystem stability in a highly dynamic market environment.\n\n# **Rationale**\n\nAligning with Arbitrum\u2019s mission to support and nurture its development community, the STIP Bridge embodies our commitment to our builders and their contributions. It strategically addresses the imminent risk of losing key ecosystem participants to competitors by offering a seamless transition in incentive support. This approach not only retains critical projects and liquidity within Arbitrum but also sets a solid foundation for the impending comprehensive Perpetual Incentives Program, reinforcing our long-term vision of innovation and community empowerment.\n\n# **Specifications**\n\n### **Eligibility**\n\n* Any protocol funded under STIP or the Backfund is eligible to apply for a bridge grant coinciding with the LTIPP distribution window.\n* This will allow Arbitrum to ensure protocols that had success during the STIP campaign can retain their users and continue to focus on building on Arbitrum.\n\n### **Maximum Funding Size:**\n\nMaximum funding requests under this bridge grant are capped based on a percentage of the prior funding received under STIP:\n\n* Greater than 500k ARB: may make a funding request of up to 50% of their prior funding.\n* Less than or equal to 500k ARB: may make funding requests up to 100% of their prior funding, capped at 250k ARB.\n\n### **STIP Performance Audits**\n\nTo give the community a better understanding of how protocols utilized their STIP grants, audits will be conducted.\n\nOpenBlock Labs has been monitoring protocols included in STIP and reporting their data using [dashboards](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/grantees).\n\nOpenBlocks will be providing closing remarks on all protocols they have data for. These summaries will include:\n\n* The percentage of STIP allocation that recipients used\n* The amount of unused funds recipient protocols returned to the incentives multisig\n* Should be any remaining amount of full allocation\n* Success metrics compared to similar control protocols\n* Insights into oddities that occurred during the incentive period\n\nAdditional analysis opportunities:\n\nAdditionally, this proposal team has already asked the ARDC that once they are prepared to provide additional analysis and insights to prepare for LTIP.\n\nThis is also a great opportunity for Arbitrum community members to use the data that OpenBlocks has been sharing in their open-source dashboards to create their own analysis. Community-driven analysis of the success of STIP will bring many interpretations of the data and help delegates make the most informed decisions. This analysis could be compensated via a portion of the research bounty budget from LTIPP.\n\n### **Advisors Help**\n\nThe [advisors](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ltipp-regarding-our-role-instructions-for-applicants-and-open-questions-we-aim-to-answer/21297) from the LTIPP (JoJo, SeedLatam, Castel Capital) proved to be a tremendous help to applicants as they ensured protocols received quality feedback, a better understanding of how much ARB they should request, and possible incentive mechanisms to use. Additionally, the Advisors stay on to support the protocols during the program allowing each team to better learn and iterate through testing.\n\nThe LTIPP advisors have agreed to assist similarly during the STIP bridge. Protocols applying to the bridge will have the opportunity to meet with an advisor. This will help them gain insights into their proposals. This not only helps guide applicants through the process but also ensures the DAO will have better proposals to review.\n\nThe advisors will hold office hours during the Addendum period to help answer questions protocols have, and to discuss with them through the Discord infrastructure already leveraged during LTIPP, in a way they could provide feedback on both previous results and/or new mechanisms to integrate.\n\n\n\n### **Program Manager Role**\n\nThe STIP Bridge will include a program manager to help ensure the program runs smoothly. As seen in other programs, a single manager is required to ensure efficient and effective operations and to deal with the unexpected situations that ultimately appear.\n\nProject manager responsibilities:\n\n* Ensure Addendums are properly posted\n* Administer deadlines for various phases of the program\n* Handle COI with advisors\n* Help facilitate the posting of snapshots\n* Help coordinate with the multisig to ensure funds are properly distributed\n* Update grant recipients on program progress as streams start, run, and end\n\nMatt Stein from StableLab will serve as the program manager.\n\n### **How To Apply - Addendum on STIP Forum post:**\n\nAny STIP protocol wishing to apply will fill out the [Addendum template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAfter filling out the Addendum, protocols will post it in the newly formed \u201cSTIP Bridge Addendum\u201d section of the forum. These posts should be titled \u201c\\[Protocol Name] STIP Addendum\u201d\n\nApplicants will be able to meet with an advisor during office hours to get feedback regarding their incentive plan and grant amount as protocols did with LTIPP.\n\nApplicants will have around two weeks to submit their Addendums. Beginning when the Tally vote becomes active and ending when the tally vote ends.\n\nApplicants can edit their Addendums as many times as they want until the deadline. Once the Tally vote ends Addendums are final and can no longer be modified.\n\n### **Challenge and Review Period**\n\nDuring this time between the tally vote and the optimistic snapshots, delegates will have a week to review Addendums and prepare to post challenge snapshots for applicants they believe require a closer look.\n\nAny delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated can put up a challenge snapshot using this challenge [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bA7fjU6Mnl_XXd_NYdLoQAgttKX1J8XwGzYn3SeLl8w/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAny desired challenges should be posted to the forum during the Challenge and review period (May 4th- May 11th). They then must be posted to Snapshot during the Challenge Snapshot period (May 11th- May 18th).\n\n### **Voting and Approval Mechanism:**\n\n#### **Optimistic Approach**\n\nAn optimistic voting mechanism will be used to mitigate the potential for delegate fatigue from voting on 50+ proposals while still holding projects accountable for their overall performance within STIP and in general.\n\nThis optimistic model hopes to reduce the load on all delegates but ensure that the DAO\u2019s full attention is placed on the more contentious proposals.\n\n#### **Initial Voting Mechanism**\n\nThe Tally vote will earmark funds to allow the DAO to distribute up to the maximum permissible grants.\n\nShould this Tally vote pass, all STIP protocols that properly submitted an addendum will be optimistically awarded a grant\n\n#### **Challenge Snapshot Process**\n\nIf the DAO feels some applicants should not be optimistically funded and require a closer look, any delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated may post a challenge Snapshot for a specific applicant.\n\nIf a challenge snapshot is posted, that applicant must receive at least 66% of the votes in favor of funding (Excluding abstain votes) in order to receive their bridge funding.\n\nDelegates may seek a full DAO vote at their own discretion if they believe that a project did:\n\n* (a) not fulfill their STIP requirements,\n* (b) failed to deliver tangible results during the STIP period or\n* (c) the amount sought in the bridge application would not result in an effective utilization of the DAO\u2019s funds.\n\nThis will allow the DAO delegates to focus their available attention to more closely examine contested applications.\n\nAny desired challenges should be posted to the forum during the Challenge and review period (May 4th- May 11th). They then must be posted to Snapshot during the Challenge Snapshot period (May 11th- May 18th).\n\n### **Possibility of Extension**\n\nIn case the full long-term incentives program gets delayed, this proposal will have a built-in extension method to prevent another gap between incentive programs.\n\nIf 4 weeks before the end of STIP Bridge incentives distribution, another incentive program has not passed a snapshot, then we will post another extension directly to Tally that extends funds for protocols that received funds from LTIPP and/or STIP Bridge.\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n* Send funds to LTIP multisig\n* Have applicants post Addendums\n* Conduct Performance audits\n* Have DAO members challenge contested proposals on the forum\n* Conduct individual Snapshot votes for any challenged application\n* Have successful applicants complete compliance\n* Start streams along a similar timeline as LTIPP protocols\n* Monitored incentives throughout the program as done in STIP\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nThis is a rough timeline. We aim to start the STIP Bridge around the same time as LTIPP.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/2103876f-7f5f-463b-8d14-a648c24c0dc0_original.png)\n\n## **Overall Cost: 37.6M ARB**\n\n### **Incentives Budget: 37,500,000 ARB**\n\nSee estimated amounts [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ic15cTQNoa6xyIJcp-X8OC175MaCLMPrXtMW5eT87sI/edit#gid=1867228162)\n\n### **Operational Cost: 100K ARB**\n\nA maximum of 100K ARB will be used for the operational budget. This could be used to cover the costs of the advisors, pm, multisig signers, additional audits, and or any other expenses that come up while operating the proposal. A separate snapshot will be published to allow the DAO to decide how these funds will be spent.\n\n# **Additional Documents:**\n\n* [Addendum template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing) for protocols\n* [Delegate challenge template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bA7fjU6Mnl_XXd_NYdLoQAgttKX1J8XwGzYn3SeLl8w/edit?usp=sharing)"

    "description": "# Treasury Management V1.2\n## Abstract\n\nOn September 12th, Entropy hosted a preliminary treasury working group call (recordings available\u00a0[here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/6)) in an effort to align all of the different parties within the DAO on the optimal path forward when it comes to managing the different sections of the DAO\u2019s balance sheet. I.e., chain profits (ETH) and tokens that have been authorized for spend but have not entered circulation yet (ARB). The primary points of contention were around ARB diversification, the need for a DAO budget before the conversation on treasury management continues forward, whether the DAO needs active treasury managers at all, infrastructure selection, and details around a treasury committee\u2019s implementation, e.g., how many individuals/entities, are they DAO-elected or appointed, when should we target to have this committee stood up, etc. From our perspective, we did gain consensus that the DAO\u2019s profits (ETH) in the treasury should be turned productive and that a treasury management committee of some sort should be established. However, even on these two points that most people seem to be in favor of, specific details need to be ironed out for actionable strategies to be implemented.\n\nWe believe that we have come up with a fair compromise between all of the various perspectives on these identified issues, all of which stem from the information gathered during the working group calls and conversations with delegates. The compromise suggested herein will, in our opinion, enable the DAO to move forward and initiate the required operational standards for optimizing the use of idle tokens in the treasury. Based on the feedback received on the call on September 25th (link to recording\u00a0[here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/7)) where we presented the overarching ideas herein, we feel confident that this proposal aligns well with the treasury managers, infrastructure providers, and overall DAO sentiment towards treasury management. We are eager to gather more feedback from the community and continue iterating so this initiative can move forward.\n\n## Key Issues Treasury Management can Solve Today\n\n1. Service Provider Shortfalls: DAO-funded programs as well as service providers that have proved valuable to the DAO (the ARDC, Steakhouse\u2019s services as a part of STEP, etc.) have run into the problem of having dollar-denominated contracts and not enough ARB to meet the agreed upon rate for services rendered.\n2. Flexible & Metrics-Driven Capital Deployment: The DAO is reliant on RWAs/Treasuries for passive yield on dollars, but has no mechanism for reallocating to onchain strategies as we enter a global rate cutting regime that could make onchain yields more attractive. The DAO also currently lacks the ability to frictionlessly assess the returns and underlying risks of comparative liquid market investments, how much of/when ARB in the treasury should be diversified, and how to optimize operating cash-like reserves.\n3. Reinvesting Sequencer Revenue: The DAO has neglected to do anything productive with its ETH holdings, which could provide the DAO leverage to fuel growth and partnerships alongside yield\u2014consistent with the DAO\u2019s growth-first mindset.\n\n## The Proposed Solution\n\n### TL;DR\n\n* Establish two token management tracks (Treasury and Growth) with their own 3-seat committees. Treasury Management will focus on passive yield via ARB-only onchain strategies on Arbitrum One and create a cash-like reserve alongside a management strategy to cover service provider shortfalls. Growth Management will focus on strategic partnerships by exclusively reinvesting the DAO\u2019s ETH holdings into \u201cETH-backed strategies\u201d. ETH-backed strategies are defined as opportunities that earn yield on ETH or ETH-pegged assets, with high guarantees of returning the underlying deployed to the DAO treasury at a certain point in the future.\n  * Treasury Management \u2122: 10M ARB for ARB-only onchain strategies + 15M ARB converted to stables or other cash-like holdings to serve as a pilot for the DAO\u2019s \u201cchecking account\u201d.\n  * Growth Management (GM): 7,500 ETH allotted (about 75% of the DAOs ETH after BoLD bootstrapping), but all spend must be DAO-approved on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSince inception, the DAO has spent 19.3M ARB on core DAO initiatives (long-term committees/groups that get funding directly from the DAO via proposal), grants programs, and direct DAO-to-service provider grants according to the August\u00a0[Token Flow](https://online.flippingbook.com/view/108327950/8/#zoom=true)\u00a0report from\u00a0@r3gen. So outside of protocol/user incentives and the large GCP initiative, the DAO\u2019s spend has been relatively modest throughout the first 18 months of its life, spending about 1.07M ARB per month. The average price of ARB since the token launched sits at $1.16, which puts the DAO\u2019s rough monthly spend on these types of initiatives at $1.24M USD.\n\nIn an ideal world, we would have a budget outlined before setting aside some ARB to be converted to stablecoins or other cash-like assets to cover general operating expenses and make up for any service provider contract shortcomings. However, we need the proper people and procedures in place in order for a budget to be executed to the expected standard. We believe that the OpCo will not only be better equipped to tackle this issue, but will also have better incentive alignment with the DAO than any other entity/individual tasked with creating a DAO budget, and more data surrounding DAO-revenue to analyze.\n\nIn many cases it is unprofessional for the DAO to put the burden of ARB volatility on its service providers. If we aren\u2019t careful, we will negatively impact the pool of SPs that desire working with Arbitrum DAO. Given the aforementioned historical spend and the absence of a formal budget, we are suggesting the TM track be given 25M ARB with the intent to swap 15M ARB for stablecoins over the course of 3 months. This stablecoin reserve may be deployed in low-risk, yield-bearing strategies or other cash-like assets and will be used to cover DAO dollar-denominated expenses and service provider contract shortfalls. This cash-like balance should not be used to give out grants, but rather to pay out service providers that demand dollars. The remaining 10M ARB is to be used on ARB-only onchain strategies that are approved by the TM Committee (TMC). The TM track will solve problems 1&2 mentioned above by putting the infrastructure and service providers in place to conduct onchain strategies on both ARB and stablecoins while ensuring service providers enjoy a professional/stress-free experience working with Arbitrum. The TMC\u2019s mandate also indirectly supports ecosystem growth by focusing primarily on ARB-only strategies by leveraging Arbitrum protocols.\n\nThe need to reinvest sequencer revenue is best depicted by the following chart, which shows the DAO has foregone ~400 ETH by not staking its idle holdings.\n\n\n[<img height=\"402\" width=\"690\" alt=\"Arbitrum Revenue\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3f25fde491adc04de29d44b4d527e5f7ec5ea064_2_690x402.png\" />Arbitrum Revenue2400\u00d71400 270 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3f25fde491adc04de29d44b4d527e5f7ec5ea064.png \"Arbitrum Revenue\")\n\nHowever, given that the primary goal of the Arbitrum DAO is spreading its technology stack and promoting growth across its ecosystem, we believe that we can do better than just staking the ETH or otherwise reinvesting DAO profits into liquid market opportunities. Furthermore, Entropy Advisors has been approached by numerous protocols interested in strengthening their alliance with the Arbitrum DAO. These protocols include market leaders within well-established DeFi and infrastructure sub sectors as well as projects in emerging verticals that have generated significant attention within the industry. Some of these projects are pre-TGE, generate significant revenue, could solve liquidity fragmentation/interoperability across Orbit chains, or strengthen ARB narratives. These types of deals require a counterparty to negotiate with and discretion until a deal is formally reached. This will be one of the primary deliverables of the Growth Management Committee (GMC), but all deals will need to be approved by the DAO via a snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply prior to any engagement\u2019s execution. Again, only strategies that rely on ETH and ETH-pegged asset strategies will be pursued. It is important to note that some specific details may need to remain confidential even once the DAO begins voting via Snapshot. The GMC will play a similar role as the STEP committee so that this can be achieved. A stark contrast between the TMC and GMC is that the former will make a one-time recommendation to the DAO on how to allocate the full 25M ARB across various RFP applicants, whereas the latter will make one-off recommendations that are ad hoc in nature.\n\n\n\n## TMC and GMC: Members, Deliverables, and Pay\n\nWhile we could staff these positions via DAO election, we believe that it would be more efficient to appoint these individuals/entities given the specific qualifications required of the members. These council members will serve a term of around 6 months, with payments for both TMC and GMC members tied to specific milestones.\n\nWhen it comes to the TMC, each member will be eligible to claim 20K USDC for each of the following milestones achieved: 1) RFP process finalized and the TMC\u2019s final recommendation of which managers to move forward with and the respective amounts allocated approved via Snapshot; 2) The first quarterly report posted on the forum and continuous oversight of strategies having been performed 3) The second quarterly report posted on the forum and continuous oversight of strategies having been performed.\n\nIn terms of the GMC, the three milestones, each of which will unlock a 20K USDC payment per member (excluding Entropy), are as follows: 1) RFP process finalized and the GMC\u2019s first recommendation to which project(s) to allocate capital to approved through Snapshot; 2) given the DAO approves an allocation to a project, the first quarterly report posted on the forum and continuous risk monitoring having been performed; 3) given the DAO approves an allocation to a project, the second quarterly report posted on the forum and continuous risk monitoring having been performed.\n\nIn other words, both councils\u2019 members (excluding Entropy) will be eligible for a total of 60K USDC per member, given they reach all of their respective milestones. As always, the DAO can remove these members from the council, replace committee members with other candidate(s), or disband this program altogether at any point in time through a Snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply. Entropy Advisors is happy to assist in any type of open election process if that is deemed necessary in the future.\n\nSuggested TMC Members:\n\n* **Austin Campbell**:\n  * With a multi-decade background in trading, financial risk management, and structuring,\u00a0[Austin Campbell](https://x.com/CampbellJAustin)\u00a0is regarded as a leading expert in the field of tokenized assets, stablecoins, and crypto risk management. Austin has run trading desks at JP Morgan and Citigroup, been the head of portfolio management and chief risk officer at Paxos, and is currently the CEO of WSPN USA, a stablecoin issuer. Austin also teaches blockchain courses at NYU Stern school of business, speaks frequently on podcasts, to the media, and at regulatory events, and testified in front of Congress on stablecoins in 2023.\n  * Austin believes that treasury management in the crypto space should focus on principal protection, liquidity to ensure smooth operations, and risk-adjusted return, in that order. Austin has helped with previous efforts in this space when at Paxos, including the inclusion of USDP into the PSM for MakerDAO, as well as partnering with protocols to ensure strong economic design and stability when integrating stablecoins and real assets. A robust RFP process, a rigorous set of standards for anyone managing treasury assets, and programs for monitoring performance, activities, and conflicts are things that Austin believes are mandatory for effective treasury programs.\n\nAustin will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\n* **Three Sigma**:\n  * As seasoned experts in the DeFi ecosystem,\u00a0[Three Sigma](https://threesigma.xyz/)\u00a0is uniquely positioned to add significant value to Arbitrum\u2019s Treasury Management Council (TMC). With vast experience in risk assessment and advisory services, Three Sigma is equipped to collaboratively design and execute a transparent Request for Proposal (RFP) process for treasury managers. These RFPs will strategically identify managers aligned with the DAO\u2019s objectives\u2014such as converting ARB to stablecoins, optimizing fund deployment, and managing whitelisted ARB strategies.\n  * Three Sigma\u2019s commitment extends beyond process design, as they will serve as vigilant overseers of treasury management strategies, proactively flagging any questionable activities to the DAO. Drawing from extensive experience in helping teams design protocols with risk in mind, they uphold the principle: \u201cDon\u2019t trust, verify.\u201d Three Sigma will develop a robust methodology focused on risk-adjusted returns, evaluate service provider performance, and deliver quarterly reports to the DAO forum. These reports will offer transparent insights into performance metrics, stablecoin balances, and strategic recommendations for asset liquidation or replenishment. Leveraging their deep understanding of DeFi markets, risk management, and governance, Three Sigma aims to drive optimal outcomes for the Arbitrum DAO, safeguarding the community\u2019s assets with unwavering accountability.\n\nThree Sigma will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\n* **Make Markets**:\n  * A bespoke consulting agency focused on liquidity strategy design and optimization for asset issuers, Make Markets brings deep crypto-native technical expertise to Arbitrum\u2019s Treasury Management Council through its principals\u00a0[fiddyresearch](https://x.com/fiddyresearch), a core contributor to Curve DAO, and benny, a seasoned DeFi builder, analytics specialist and contributor to Curve DAO. We combine practical DeFi protocol engineering experience with extensive knowledge of smart contract security, on-chain data analysis and decentralized market mechanics. Their technical background enables them to assess smart contract risk and economic security considerations when reviewing strategy proposals for managers. They will also leverage our analytics capabilities and familiarity with on-chain data to provide data-driven reporting to the DAO.\n  * Make Markets believes that the TMC\u2019s success depends on establishing robust, standardized processes for evaluating and monitoring treasury managers. Their goal is to implement systematic approaches that ensure fair selection, efficient oversight, and clear performance assessment across all treasury activities. They aim to establish consistent and transparent processes that will serve the DAO over the long term and ensure accountability to the community.\n\nMake Markets will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\n**TMC Deliverables and Expected Timeline**:\n\n* Design and host an RFP process seeking treasury managers with predefined overarching strategies. E.g., the process for converting ARB to stables, how the stables can be deployed when sitting idle, the process for a DAO contributor to request stablecoins from this program within their proposal, whitelisted stablecoin/ARB strategies or protocols, etc.\u00a0**Timeline: 4 weeks after the Tally proposal executes onchain**\n* Make a recommendation to the DAO in regards to which treasury managers should be allocated funds alongside how much goes to each service provider. This will need to be passed through Snapshot with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply. The TMC is expected to post the rationale behind their recommendation on the DAO forum. If a recommendation to the DAO results in a failed vote, the TMC will reconvene and examine the reasons posted by delegates to come up with a revised allocation that addresses the community\u2019s concerns.\u00a0**Timeline: 6 weeks after the Tally proposal executes onchain**\n* Serve as a check/balance on strategies deployed by treasury managers, and flagging any questionable strategies being deployed to the DAO. This work will be ongoing work once the funds have been deployed until the end of the committee\u2019s engagement. If the OpCo is not at a point where it can absorb/oversee these responsibilities, Entropy will put up a continuation proposal to make sure that risk management capabilities are maintained.\u00a0**Timeline: Continuously after fund deployment**\n* Developing a methodology for evaluating service provider performance, with risk-adjusted returns as the focal point.\u00a0**Timeline: Finalized before fund deployment; facilitated continuously after fund deployment**\n* Prepare quarterly reports (2 over the course of their term) for the DAO forum that provides visibility into service provider performance.\n  * These reports should also include updates on the stablecoin balance, and provide recommendations to the DAO in relation to liquidating more of the allocated ARB for stablecoins, or requesting additional ARB to top up the stablecoin reserve. Timeline: Every 3 months after fund deployment\n\n**Suggested GMC Members**:\n\n* [Entropy Advisors](https://x.com/EntropyAdvisors)\n  * Entropy Advisors will be waiving payment.\n* [Callen](https://x.com/cvant_)\u00a0from Wintermute\n  * Callen will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n* [Llama Risk](https://www.llamarisk.com/)\n  * Llama Risk will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\nThe primary qualifications for GMC members are the ability to negotiate deals and possess large networks within the wider crypto industry. They may also be required to sign and adhere to NDAs. Entropy felt it was important to add a risk-focused member to the GMC so that economic, general smart contract, and other design risks can be better accounted for when evaluating deals. The GMC will receive support from Arbitrum partnership teams (Foundation and OCL), thus ensuring all opportunities are explored and that whatever the GMC is exploring does not conflict with that of Arbitrum partnership teams.\n\n**GMC Deliverables and Expected Timeline**:\n\n* Design and host an RFP process seeking protocol partnerships through the deployment of the DAO\u2019s ETH, which must target the use of ETH itself or ETH-pegged assets. It is possible that these applications will be ongoing rather than a specified time period. Some information may need to remain confidential\u2014this body will follow a similar playbook as the STEP Committee.\u00a0**Timeline: 4 weeks after the Tally proposal executes onchain**\n* Serve as the point of contact/negotiating body for protocol teams interested in a deeper alliance with the Arbitrum DAO.\u00a0**Timeline: Continuously throughout the GMC\u2019s term**\n* As suitable deals arise, make recommendations to the DAO on the forum that can then be confirmed or denied via a Snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply.\u00a0**Timeline: Continuously throughout the GMC\u2019s term, or until all funds have been allocated**\n* Coordinate the amplification/marketing of engagements across various Arbitrum contributors, e.g., the Foundation, OCL, protocols, etc.\u00a0**Timeline: This will coincide with the passing of a deal\u2019s recommendation through Snapshot**\n* Prepare 2 reports over the course of their term for the DAO forum that provide visibility into the status/general success and failures of the growth partnerships being deployed.\u00a0**Timeline: Reports will only be made following the deployment of ETH into DAO-approved strategies, and will come at a cadence of every 3 months**\n* Evaluate smart contract or general economic risk of potential partnerships before they are proposed to the DAO\u00a0**Timeline: Case-by-case basis, i.e., as deals arise**\n* Monitor the projects that have received an allocation from the Arbitrum DAO and notify the Arbitrum Foundation of any risks that arise as a result of general market conditions, fundamental, or technical risks. If the OpCo is not at a point where it can absorb/oversee these responsibilities, Entropy will put up a continuation proposal to make sure that risk management capabilities are maintained.\u00a0**Timeline: Continuously throughout the GMC\u2019s term once funds have been deployed**\n  * This is one of the primary motivations for adding Llama Risk to the GMC, as this is work they specialize in.\n\n## Specifications / \u201cCosts\u201d\n\nIn order to reduce ambiguity around tax, legal, and any other possible liabilities, we suggest that the Arbitrum Foundation serves as the custodian/counterparty of the funds at all times. The TMC and the GMC simply help coordinate the process, the DAO still remains as the ultimate decision maker, and the Foundation serves as the custodian/counterparty of the funds and thus abides by Cayman Islands law. While the MSS is great for serving as the DAO\u2019s solution to multi-sigs, it is clear that the Arbitrum Foundation is the most logical party to custody these funds, until the OpCo\u2019s legal entity is stood up and fully operational, to avoid unforeseen legal liabilities.&#x20;\n\nIf this vote passes onchain via Tally, 7,500 ETH and 26M ARB will be moved to this [address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xAc20CD734C65Baf48a1476447af7D3E3165DC739#tokentxns), and then transferred to two separate foundation controlled addresses. No funds can be deployed by either the TMC or GMC\u2014they are only tasked with providing options for the DAO to vote on, and the Arbitrum Foundation will be subject to act in accordance with how the DAO votes. The additional 1M ARB being transferred to the Foundation will be liquidated for 300k USDC in the most suitable manner to pay committee members, with the remainder immediately returned to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO can claw back funds at any time via a snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply. It is worth noting that some of the initiatives in the GM track may contain verbiage that prevents the DAO from clawing back a specific allotment of funds. As mentioned, the DAO will ultimately make the decision on these deals, so delegates/voters will need to review and take these factors into account when voting. Again, the GMC members may be under NDA and only be able to disclose what the partner in question is willing to share publicly. As proposed, the GMC will receive assistance from the OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation, and it is equipped with members with strong BD skill sets and risk evaluation experience. Therefore, we feel confident the GMC will only have the DAO\u2019s best interest in mind.\n\nLastly, we want to emphasize that this is not a proposal to spend these funds, so the funds being moved are not actually a \u201ccost\u201d to the DAO. Rather, these funds will be used for diversifying risks and creating yield, laying the groundwork for prudent financial management for the Arbitrum DAO, setting it up for long-term success, sustainability, and growth. The only costs incurred by the DAO from this proposal are those of specific committee members, which equates to 300k USDC if all milestones are achieved. Entropy received overwhelming feedback from both interested committee members and the broader Arbitrum DAO community that the payment needed to be altered from 30k ARB vested over 2 years to a more attractive payment arrangement in order to attract the right people.\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n1. September 12, 2024: Prelim. Treasury Working Group Call\u00a0#1\u00a0(recording\u00a0[here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/6))\n2. September 25, 2024: Prelim. Treasury Working Group Call\u00a0#2\u00a0(recording\u00a0[here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/7))\n3. September 27, 2024: Treasury Management V1 proposal posted on the Forum\n4. November 14, 2024: Snapshot vote to move forward with Treasury Management V1\n5. December 2nd, 2024: Proposal is moved to Tally\n6. Late-December: If the Tally vote successfully passes, funds will be moved to the Arbitrum Foundation and the TMC/GMC can begin their work.\n\n## Long-term Desires\n\nThis proposal remedies 3 key problems plaguing the Arbitrum DAO today, and sets the stage for all of the DAO\u2019s identified financial management needs being met in the future:\n\n> 1. Service Provider Shortfalls: DAO-funded programs as well as service providers that have proved valuable to the DAO (the ARDC, Steakhouse\u2019s services as a part of STEP, etc.) have run into the problem of having dollar-denominated contracts and not enough ARB to meet the agreed upon rate for services rendered.\n> 2. Flexible & Metrics-Driven Capital Deployment: The DAO is reliant on RWAs/Treasuries for passive yield on dollars, but has no mechanism for reallocating to onchain strategies as we enter a global rate cutting regime that could make onchain yields more attractive. The DAO also currently lacks the ability to frictionlessly assess the returns and underlying risks of comparative liquid market investments, how much of/when ARB in the treasury should be diversified, and how to optimize operating cash-like reserves.\n> 3. Reinvesting Sequencer Revenue: The DAO has neglected to do anything productive with its ETH holdings, which could provide the DAO leverage to fuel growth and partnerships alongside yield\u2014consistent with the DAO\u2019s growth-first mindset.\n\nWe envision the functions of the TMC and the GMC to roll up into OpCo once established and fully operationalized, and depending upon the OpCo\u2019s structure, e.g., Cayman Islands Foundation entity, the OpCo could become the custodian of these funds in the future. A lot of the ground work around treasury management will be handled by the TMC and GMC in the interim, and will provide the OpCo with a rubric that can be improved upon as it relates to procuring treasury managers, budgeting, transparency/reporting, etc.\n\nThis is a good starting point as it ensures service providers do not bear the burden of ARB volatility, puts the infrastructure and SPs in place for the DAO to conduct onchain strategies, and generates revenue while spurring growth across the Arbitrum ecosystem."

    "description": "# Request to Increase the Stylus Sprint Committee\u2019s Budget\n### Non-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\n* The Stylus Sprint program saw overwhelming demand, with 147 applications requesting ~31.92 million ARB, significantly exceeding the initial budget.\n* This proposal requests an\u00a0**additional 4 million ARB**\u00a0to extend the committee\u2019s original budget. The funds will enable the evaluation committee to fund a set of exceptional applications that were excluded due to budget constraints.\n* The committee has provided the list of applicants that it strongly recommends deserve to be funded as part of the Sprint, in addition to the 5M ARB already\u00a0[allocated](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sprint-results-announcing-the-accepted-applications/28294). Rationale and a summary of the applicants is linked in the proposal.\n* We will be moving this request to\u00a0**Snapshot next Thursday, February 6th**. If approved, an onchain vote will move forward the following Thursday as to not further disrupt the proposed timelines of the applicants.\n\n## Motivation/Rationale\n\nWith 147 applications and ~31.92 million ARB in funding requests, demand for the Stylus Sprint program significantly exceeded expectations. The committee received a large number of exceptional applications, but unfortunately, due to the initial budget constraints, the committee was only able to fund 17 applications. They were chosen based on a combination of factors including cost, timeline, necessity for immediate start, RFP category importance, and the priority to fund both applications and infrastructure/tooling.\n\nWhile the committee has\u00a0[accepted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sprint-results-announcing-the-accepted-applications/28294)\u00a0a subset of the applicants, there remains an important opportunity to support impactful ideas and high-quality teams. With Stylus as one of Arbitrum\u2019s strongest competitive advantages, the committee strongly believes that enabling all impressive applications received as a part of the Stylus Sprint with funding is a worthwhile investment for the DAO.\n\nThis proposal seeks an additional allocation of 4 million ARB tokens to extend funding opportunities to promising projects that were not initially accepted into the Sprint. With this budget extension, the committee will be able to fund an additional group of applicants, outlined in detail below. While there are many more strong applications, the recommended list scored especially high during the review process and are ones that the committee is confident have the potential to provide value to the Arbitrum and Stylus ecosystems.\n\n## Specifications\n\nAs stated in the original Stylus Sprint proposal, large requests may be directed to the DAO directly to request funding. This process was communicated to applicants, some of which elected to go this route over reducing their request. The smaller applicants in this list are in the committee\u2019s opinion worthwhile investments that have the potential to improve Stylus long-term.\n\nThe following list of applicants are the ones that come with a strong recommendation from the committee and to reiterate were unable to be accepted due to budget constraints.\n\nOpen Application\n\n1.

The committee is aware of some applicants that may bring revised versions and/or lower budgets than when they were originally reviewed. While we appreciate that Arbitrum DAO\u2019s open and decentralized essence provides the freedom to make such requests, we\u2019d encourage delegates to be mindful of the possible precedent funding projects circumventing the program would set. When appropriate, the committee has already directed certain applications to be on the look out for alternative DAO programs, such as the Season 3 of\u00a0[Arbitrum D.A.O](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-rfc-arbitrum-d-a-o-domain-allocator-offerings-grant-program-season-3/27584)\u00a0program if it\u2019s approved.\n\nIf this proposed extension is approved on Snapshot, we will move it immediately to an onchain vote the following Thursday, February 20th. The recommended applicants will be held to the current Stylus Sprint timeline, so the committee would like to not unnecessarily delay the ability to fund these projects. Projects funded as part of the Stylus Sprint\u2019s budget increase will benefit from the infrastructure already in place as far as MSS/payments and milestone reviews by the evaluation committee.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe Stylus Sprint committee is requesting an\u00a0**additional 4,000,000 ARB**\u00a0to extend its Stylus Sprint budget. If approved, the funds will be sent to the existing MSS-controlled Stylus Sprint multisig.\n\n## Timeline\n\n**January 30th:**\u00a0Forum Post\n**February 6-13th:**\u00a0Snapshot Vote\n**February 20th - March 6th:**\u00a0Tally Vote\n**March 9th:**\u00a0Funds delivered to Stylus Sprint multisig\n**March 10th:**\u00a0Recommended teams join the Stylus Sprint\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nEntropy and the committee have no conflicts of interest associated with the recommended applicants or this proposal requesting an extension of funds."

    "description": "# ArbitrumDAO Contribution; Safeguarding Software Developers\u2019 Rights\nAbstract & Rationale - This proposal envisages a monetary contribution to DEF & Coin Center from the ArbitrumDAO to continue their policy, litigation & advocacy efforts in relation to open-source software & software developers\u2019 rights.\n\n*Proposal authored by Immutablelawyer from* [*Axis Advisory*](https://www.axisadvisory.xyz/)\\*\\*\u00a0\n\n**Context & Preamble**\n\nThe digital asset industry has been faced with recent legal challenges in relation to a software developer\u2019s individual freedom to contribute to the development and subsequent deployment of open-source permissionless software. This goes as far back as 1990 when Phil Zimmerman released Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), one of the first openly available public-key cryptography applications that featured end-to-end (E2E) encryption. Zimmerman\u2019s creation prompted a criminal investigation that was eventually dropped, resulting in federal court decisions that protect encryption under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment. This clash on personal privacy became dubbed the \u201cencryption wars.\u201d\n\nOur team over at Axis Advisory has published a write-up that offers contextual information in relation to the above: [Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom 4](https://axisadvisoryxyz.substack.com/p/defending-open-source-a-united-stand)\n\nIn this regard, we are proposing a contribution from the ArbitrumDAO to DEF & CoinCenter to continue their policy & litigation efforts in relation to privacy-enhancement tooling and software developer advocacy. Some of the institutions\u2019 most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\n**COIN CENTER**\n\n1. Coin Center\u2019s case against the Office of Foreign Assets Control about adding Tornado Cash to the OFAC Sanction List, (naturally, Tornado Cash not being a person or entity but a mere set of open-source smart contracts running on the Ethereum Blockchain). Albeit the court ruling against Coin Center in the initial proceedings, Coin Center is currently in the process of appealing the judgment.\n\n\\[Refer: [Coin Center is suing OFAC over its Tornado Cash sanction 2](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/)].\n\n\\[Refer: <https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304.74.0.pdf>];\n\n1. Coin Center\u2019s concerns raised to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regarding the designation of convertible virtual currency (CVC) mixing as a primary money laundering concern (PMLC). In this regard, Coin Center highlighted the rule\u2019s extensive scope and lack of precedent. They argued that the proposed designation lacks clarity and narrowly tailored definitions, potentially leading to the misclassification of legitimate transactions as criminal.\n\n\\[Refer: [Comments to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on \u201cProposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing, as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering Concern\u201d](https://www.coincenter.org/comments-to-the-financial-crimes-enforcement-network-on-proposal-of-special-measure-regarding-convertible-virtual-currency-mixing-as-a-class-of-transactions-of-primary-money-laundering-conce/)]\n\n1. Coin Center\u2019s letter to the Senate Finance Committee highlighing the need for a regulatory approach that mirrors the successful, light-touch framework applied to the internet. Coin Center advocated for clear taxation guidelines on cryptocurrency transactions, emphasizing the importance of a de minimis exemption for minor gains from every transaction to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies in daily commerce without undue tax burdens.\n\n\\[Refer: [Coin Center Suggestions to Address Uncertain Tax Treatment of Digital Assets](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-suggestions-to-address-uncertain-tax-treatment-of-digital-assets/)]\n\n1. Coin Center\u2019s contributions to Roman Storm\u2019s and Alexey Pertsev\u2019s legal defense in relation to the following:\n\n* Roman Storm\u2019s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of conspiracy to facilitate money laundering, operate an unlicensed money transmitter and violating sanctions \\[Court of New York]; and\n* Alexey Pertsev\u2019s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of facilitating money laundering \\[Netherlands Court].\n\n**DEFI EDUCATION FUND**\n\nSome of the DeFi Education Fund\u2019s most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund initiated a legal challenge against a patent held by True Return Systems, LLC regarding blockchain technology, challenging the novelty and validity of its claims. This action reflects DEF\u2019s commitment to preserve the digital assets space\u2019s core values: fostering innovation, ensuring open access, and maintaining an inclusive environment. By contesting what DEF consider to be an overly broad patent, they aim to prevent potential monopolistic control, ensuring the decentralization is not compromised.\n\n\\[Refer: [https://www.defieducationfund.org/\\_files/ugd/84ba66\\_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf1](https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf)].\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund filed a legal complaint along with Beba LLC against the SEC, after they recently created and distributed their \u2018BEBA token\u2019 via airdrops. Beba and DEF are seeking legal relief due to concerns that the SEC may classify BEBA tokens as securities, which could end up hindering not only their business operations but also the broader digital asset market. In essence, the DEF are fighting against the SEC\u2019s approach towards digital assets which has become overly broad without adequate rule-making procedures, stifling innovation.\n\n\\[Refer: <https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_3f7a8f2ca6614d7381122cb1beeed4a8.pdf>].\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund submitted an amicus brief in support of James Harper against the IRS, advocating for the Fourth Amendment rights of cryptocurrency users. DEF emphasizes the need to balance law enforcement\u2019s reach with individual\u2019s financial privacy in the digital realm. They are arguing for a modern interpretation of privacy protections to reflect the realities of digital transactions and the traceability of cryptocurrency activities on public ledgers.\n\n\\[Refer: [DeFi Education Fund Files Amicus Brief In Coinbase Case](https://www.coinlive.com/news/DeFi-Education-Fund-Files-Amicus-Brief-In-Coinbase-Case)].\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund also contributed to the support of Roman Storm\u2019s legal defense arguing against the novel legal theories proposed by the government under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and money laundering statutes. DEF emphasizes the importance of distinguishing software developers from the actions of third-party users, in order to protect software developers from being held liability for third-party misuse of their open-source.\n\n\\[Refer: <https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_063f9d1fd563466cadfa3f5434f918e9.pdf>].\n\n**OBJECTIVE**\n\n**Coin Center Contribution**\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to Coin Center; the leading non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies.\n\nBy way of a brief; Coin Center\u2019s mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code \u2013 to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately.\n\nCoin Center has been at the forefront of policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties of software developers and other stakeholders within the industry.\n\n**DeFi Education Fund Contribution**\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to the DEF whose mission revolves around educating policymakers globally about DeFi, promoting grassroots supports, enhancing legal support across jurisdictions, and advocating for policies welcoming of decentralized financial infrastructure.\n\nThey have initiated several key projects and grants to advance its objectives. One of their initial endeavors targeted a group of organizations and individuals, with the goal of expanding the understanding of decentralization and the DeFi ecosystem among policymakers.\n\nAdditionally, the DEF is taking a stand against how some governments interpret laws in a way that could establish a troubling precedent, potentially discouraging software developers in various fields. They pointed out the risk that developers might face legal action for their open-source code if it is misused by other for illegal activities. This could place developers are risk of being held criminally responsible for actions they didn\u2019t partake in, possibly affecting them years or even decades later.\n\n**CONTRIBUTION TO COIN CENTER \\[A NOTE FROM THE ORGANIZATION]**\n\nFounded in 2014, [Coin Center 4](https://www.coincenter.org/) is an independent non-profit organization focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies. Our mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code \u2013 to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately. We do this by producing and publishing policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and by engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties.\n\nWe are presently litigating two cases against the U.S. government. One is on Section 6050I crypto tax reporting, [pushing back against expanded warrantless financial surveillance 1](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-has-filed-a-court-challenge-against-the-treasury-dept-over-unconstitutional-financial-surveillance/). The other is a civil case [challenging the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s designation of immutable smart contracts 2](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/). We argue that the Treasury does not have the statutory authority to add the Tornado Cash pool contracts to the list of sanctioned persons because immutable smart contracts are neither sanctioned persons themselves nor the property of any sanctioned person. We are fighting not only for the right of U.S. persons to continue using these tools but also seeking to set an important precedent: that the Treasury Department can\u2019t simply identify decentralized apps and add them to the sanctions list without any evidence that the app is controlled by or enriches any sanctioned person.\n\nWe are also coordinating with Roman Storm\u2019s legal defense on an amicus brief in his criminal defense. Our amicus focuses on accurately describing the operation of Tornado Cash and the role that developers play in creating decentralized apps like Tornado Cash. We argue that publishing decentralized app software, both to the blockchain and to web servers, is not the kind of activity that can give rise to prohibitions under U.S. sanctions laws because (a) U.S. sanctions laws exclude from prohibitions any transactions for information or information materials and (b) the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment protects publishing software as \u201cpure speech\u201d warranting the strictest scrutiny from our courts.\n\nFinally, we are [continuously engaged](https://www.coincenter.org/blog/) in education and lobbying efforts in Congress and the various federal agencies in the U.S. to ensure that any changes to financial surveillance law does not impinge the free speech, privacy, and assembly rights of developers and users.\n\nA grant to Coin Center will be used to support our ongoing work and to contribute to the legal defense of developers facing criminal prosecution.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nIn conclusion, the contributions mentioned above are not just a matter of protecting individual rights but a testament to our collective commitment to preserving the principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within the industry. By supporting this initiative, we affirm our dedication to upholding these principles and defending the right of developers to contribute to the deployment of permissionless open-source software without fear of reprisal or censorship.\n\n**Funding**\n\nAs per the temperature check passed by the ArbitrumDAO on the 24th of April 2024, Coin Center and DeFi Education Fund will receive 500,000ARB each.\u00a0\n\n**Payment Terms**\n\nThe funds will from this proposal will initially be sent to an account controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation `0x5bb0a919345aF084854BCDc9A6DDdE8b7FEe79aD` , who will handle the transfers to Coin Center and DeFi Education Fund:\n\n60% of the funds will be directly sent to Coin Center and DeFi Education Fund with the remaining 40% being vested in a linear manner with no cliff for a period of 4 months thereafter."

    "description": "# [UPDATED] Proposal to Establish the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\nThis is a non-constitutional proposal.&#x20;\n\n**Amendments in light of community feedback:**\n\n* Standard 50,000ARB for the DAOAdvocate role due to the important nature of the role re. the ARDC.\n\n**Abstract**\u00a0- This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members\u2019 ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation**\u00a0- The ARDC\u2019s role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale**\u00a0- the ARDC\u2019s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\u00a0- Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded,\u00a0[@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer)\u00a0will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\n**Specifications & Timeline**\u00a0- Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost**\u00a0- Fund the ARDC with 1.715 Million ARB + Multi-Sig Budget for a 6-Month Term.\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n* 665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n* 5,000 ARB per month - Multi-Sig members\n* 16.0000 ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised as a result of the elected members and their corresponding fees will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining \u2018Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\u2019 or \u2018ARDC\u2019: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members\u2019 ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition\u00a011](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot\u00a07](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC\u2019s mandate will naturally aid in \u2018Governance Optimization\u2019 through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC\u2019s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition\u2019s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO\u2019s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC\u2019s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe\u00a0***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC\u2019s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate\u2019s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem\u2019s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024\u00d7768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF:\u00a0[The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs\u00a03](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member\u2019s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC\u2019s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC\u2019S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it\u2019s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC\u2019s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC\u2019s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.\n* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC\u2019s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums."

Investment Agreement and Arbitrum benefits\n5. Long-Term Vision\n6. Conclusion\n7. FAQs\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nA few months ago, Arbitrum funded the\u00a0[Arbitrum CollabTech Hackathon](https://www.rndao.io/blog/post/arbitrum-collabtech-hackathon-impact-report)\u00a0through Questbook. This month-long event has just come to an end, having gathered great talent and energy.\n\nWe\u2019ve got\n\n* 164 applications and\u00a0[144 participants](https://lu.ma/pkbzi9ab)\n* 20 projects submitted\n* [15 finalist projects](https://x.com/RnDAO__/status/1854246689554776121)\u00a0that are solving real problems with tech for governance, identity, reputation, and more. All are built on Arbitrum.\n* [3 winners having built a narrowly focused PoC]()\n* Contribo: matching talent to tasks is a foundational need in any collaboration. Contribo is tackling the right parts of this well, focusing on smooth UX and simplicity yet strong onchain components.\n* Signals: A much-needed tool for DAOs to easily define priorities and transform chat-group noise into meaningful proposals. It also provides additional utility for native tokens.\n* Separated Powers: A more flexible approach to role definition, well architected. Could advance automation in onchain organisations significantly and provide a system for reducing the overhead of checks and balances.\n\nWe\u2019ve created a funnel for builders on Arbitrum and we want to sustain this momentum. However, without support, the teams will soon seek opportunities elsewhere. Questbook new protocols track is out of funding but, even if it had funding, the projects need not only capital but also network access and expertise.\n\nRnDAO proposes to co-fund (roughly 50-50) a program in partnership with Arbitrum to invest in and support these teams.\n\nThis program is designed to take projects from a hackathon PoC to engage in systematic customer validation, iterate and develop an MVP, and get their first 100 users. As such, we\u2019re leveraging the raw talent and expecting the projects to evolve significantly as they engage and validate with customers, achieving traction at the end of the program.\n\n# 2. The Solution: Turn Hackathon Wins into Long-Term Success\"\n\nEarly-stage projects often stall or fail within a few months because they lack a deep understanding of their target audience and its needs. Systematic customer validation can significantly increase the likelihood of projects thriving beyond this initial stage.\n\nThis initiative, co-funded by RnDAO and Arbitrum, aims to build an ecosystem of unique Arbitrum-based projects that will continue to grow and attract new projects.\n\nWe\u2019ve designed a 6-month, two-phase program to capture the best of the hackathon talent and energy.\n\n* Phase 1 focuses on validating ideas (customer development, lean startup, and design thinking methods) and understanding the competitive landscape.\n* Phase 2 supports projects to move from PoC to the development of a market-viable MVP and securing the first 100 users.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\n* We will select the 4 most promising hackathon teams to join the program (through due diligence by the RnDAO investment committee and signing of an investment contract).\n* Each project will receive an initial stipend ($12k over 3 months) in Phase 1.\n* Upon successful completion of user research, validation of interest, and presentation of a viable business case (solid pitch deck), the top 2 projects can move to Phase 2.\n* Phase 2 projects are awarded an additional $38k and receive hands-on support (sales strategy, biz dev, marketing amplification, intros to funders, team formation, setting up ops processes and legal, setting up agile product development processes, etc.).\n\nGoals:\n\n* short-term (6 months): projects validate their concepts with customers (first 100 users) and generate traction to fundraise from investors or otherwise receive follow-on funding or generate revenue.\n* long-term: create a group of unique ventures that collaborate and integrate ([business cluster](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/business-clusters-as-a-strategy-for-arbitrum/21098)), drawing in new projects like a magnet with less direct involvement from our team.\n\n# 3. Proposed Support Program\n\nProgram Structure (Two Phases)\n\nBy breaking funding and mentorship into two distinct phases, we derisk capital allocation. Only projects that successfully validate customer demand and can showcase a market gap in the first phase will advance to the second phase, ensuring that resources are focused on ventures with proven potential.\n\n[<img height=\"196\" width=\"690\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f977ad8d550f36967b0105502bdb172c9621c1a8_2_690x196.jpeg\" />image1920\u00d7548 28.2 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f977ad8d550f36967b0105502bdb172c9621c1a8.jpeg \"image\")\n\n**Phase 1: Entrepreneurs in Residence (EiR) - Customer Validation (3 Months)**\n\n* Funding: Each project receives $2,000 per month per cofounder (max 2 cofounders receiving funding per project), totalling $12,000 per project for Phase 1.\n* Goal: Support validation with real users to confirm demand and solidify the project\u2019s foundation.\n* Process: Most hackathon projects lack any customer validation and have a shallow understanding of the problem. As such, they fail to gain traction and die. In Phase 1 we focus on addressing these issues head-on by guiding projects through a structured customer validation process, with\n* weekly strategy and customer development mentoring sessions\n* shadowing user research calls and providing feedback\n* multiple hours of hands-on support per week (up to 8 hours per week directly with each project and extra cohort work) to refine their outreach campaigns (tactical support on copy, messaging, refining target user groups, introductions, implementing automation tools, etc.) and support on making the competitive landscape.\n\n**Transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2:**\n\n* Assessment by RnDAO investment committee (we\u2019ll invest significant labour in the next phase and so will only approve teams we deem viable).\n* Assessment based on market viability (clearly understood customer problem, market gap, proposed solution based on customer insights, viable team).\n\n**Phase 2: Development and Scaling (3 Months)**\n\n* Funding: Projects that successfully complete Phase 1 will receive an additional grant of $38,000 each, amounting to a total of $50,000 per venture across both phases (enough to build and market test a basic MVP plus 3 months runway for market testing and securing the next bit of funding).\n* Goal: This phase supports full product development, go-to-market strategy, and readiness for sustainable operation, whether through fundraising, revenue, or further grants.\n* Process: After initial customer validation, the key challenge for founders is being spread too thin, while needing to set up an effective, agile product development process to quickly validate hypotheses and accelerate product-market-fit, ensure financial sustainability (pitch development and fundraising), set up a fully functioning team (talent recruitment), and operate the organisation (admin and ops). We\u2019ll help teams with all of these challenges, operating as a fractional c-suite (down in the trenches with them, up to 10 hours per week with each project and extra cohort work) and fast-track their brand recognition and network with the support of our marketing team.\n\nRnDAO Program\u2019s Value and advantages over regular incubation programs\n\n1. Swarm Collaboration: participants join an alliance of similar projects, encouraging integrations (good for project retention in Arbitrum), sharing best practices, co-marketing, cross-selling, and more. RnDAO facilitates this through a system of guilds, collaborative databases, cross-ownerhsip, and facilitating specific collaborations.\n2. Not just advisory, hands-on operators: we get our hands dirty working directly in the projects, fast-tracking their development with world-class expertise, including\u00a0[Drea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreagallagher/)\u00a0(led research for Google Suite, Asana, Aragon, etc. 50% time-commitment to the program),\u00a0[Gokhan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/polat/details/experience/)\u00a0(venture-building expert and 8x entrepreneur. Full-time commitment to the program), and\u00a0[Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conductal/)\u00a0(organisation designer, ex-Head of Gov Aragon, 4x founder, etc. full-time commitment to the program.). Additionally, we provide access to industry-leading mentors (e.g. mentors for the Hackathon included Kevin Owoki, Nader Dabit, Dennison Bertram, Reka Medvcz, David Phelps, etc.).\n3. Network access:\n\n* Support in establishing customer relationships by leveraging the RnDAO vertically-specialized network and peers\u2019 networks.\n* Assistance in securing additional funding and achieving self-sustainability.\n* Talent network and talent attraction support via RnDAO community and comms channels.\n\n1. Enhanced Visibility:\n\n* Increased attention from investors and customers through the RnDAO brand umbrella and marketing initiatives.\n\nCombined, these strategies enable us to provide high-quality and hands-on support, customer access, market insights, and talent access, resulting in faster time to market and reduced failure rate for projects.\n\nMore on Swarm methodology and data-backed comparison with other types of programs:[\u00a0https://www.rndao.io/blog/post/startups-from-solo-to-multiplayer-from-ad-hoc-to-systematic](https://www.rndao.io/blog/post/startups-from-solo-to-multiplayer-from-ad-hoc-to-systematic)\n\nOverview of support offered: \u200b\u200b\n\n[https://docsend.com/view/jys5wqqg9vi8qknm](https://docsend.com/view/jys5wqqg9vi8qknm)\n\nProgram Outcome:\n\nIn six months, we aim for at least 2 of the projects to:\n\n1. Get their first 100 users.\n2. generate revenue (early validation), and/or\n3. secure additional grants or successfully fundraise to continue growing.\n\n# 4. Implementation Plan - Budget\n\nThe budget is divided in 4 categories:\n\n* Capital Investment into the projects: direct capital allocation to the teams.\n* Venture Support: hands-on support and mentorship given to the projects.\n* Program Ops: creation of monthly program reports to the DAO & delegates stakeholder management, program branding and promotion of Arbitrum as a great home for builders (including coordination with Arbitrum Foundation marketing team), program management and overhead (team mamangement and contracting)\n* Grants: an incentive for user interview participants in Phase 1.\n\n### Total Program Cost:\n\n[<img height=\"219\" width=\"690\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/037a09ecabf00ed4b4cc885c67e1060075bb33fa_2_690x219.png\" />791\u00d7252 59.3 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/037a09ecabf00ed4b4cc885c67e1060075bb33fa.png)\n\n* Difference with previous budget:\n* CollabBerry grant has been eliminated as per the Snapshot vote.\n* Based on feedback, we also added an extra cost ($2,000) for post program reporting (3 months after completion).\n* The cost attribution has been reviewed for increased granularity between Ops and Ventures Support.\n\n[](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/hackathon-continuation-program/27492/85 \"go to the quoted post\")<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/danielo/48/5539_2.png\" />\u00a0danielo:\n\n> As a nounance (we\u2019ll clarify this before going onchain), the Comms costs are added within Ops but technically we can break these down with more sophisticated accounting into:\\* program reporting\\* amplifying projects through RnDAO channels and coordinating with Arbitrum Foundaton and others to amplify\\* coaching projects on comms/growthSo perhaps anoher 10-15k can be attributed to Venture Support.\n\n* Given our internal model of a small team that has to complete multiple tasks, the cost attribution can be broken down in multiple ways. Previously we opted for a simple rule of thumb to reduce confusion amongst delegates (unsuccesfully): Contributor A gets attributed 100% to Ops, Contributor B 100% to Venture Support. Now the system is more akin to Contributor A split between Ops and Venture Support as per their responsibilities, and same for Contributor B, etc. We can\u2019t share this data publicly without revealing sensitive details of our operation including the total earnings of each contributor. If delegates consider an audit essential, we can only offer access after singing an NDA. We encourage the DAO to develop standard guidelines as the level of granularity demanded across suppliers vary greatly and a privacy-preserving mechanism would be ideal.\n* How RnDAO cost are calculated: The RnDAO budget contribution is based on the provision of services valued at the cost of the staff contracted for this pilot (rates based on full-time equivalent, not on freelancer/consultant rates). The value is thus not calculated on the rate we could charge for these services but merely on our own internal cost. The fee structure means that RnDAO runs the program at a deficit (we invest significantly into the startups, generating a financial loss). The model is designed so RnDAO can recoup this loss over the long term IF the projects incubated become significantly valuable.\n\n# 5. Funds Management & Payment Schedule\n\nThe funds provided by ArbitrumDAO will be transferred to the Arbitrum MSS.\n\nThe funds are then transferred from the MSS wallet in two phases and to two separate RnDAO controlled multisigs for easy auditing\n\n* RnDAO multisig for Capital deployment into projects\n* RnDAO multisig for Program (combined ops, venture support, and interviewees grant).\n\n[<img height=\"175\" width=\"690\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1bb09788ba9d1e881553abdaea64f083faf3a8f0.png\" />795\u00d7202 39.4 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1bb09788ba9d1e881553abdaea64f083faf3a8f0.png)\n\n# 6. Reporting\n\nMonthly reports for the duration of the program including\n\n* overall program progress (timeline, budget usage, execution challenges if any)\n* venture selected and rationale (at the start of phase 1 and phase 2)\n* venture status updates (stage of development, traction and news)\n* learnings (retrospective on last month and actions)\n\nReport 3 months after project completion including\n\n* venture status updates (stage of development, traction and news)\n\n# 7. Investment Agreement and Arbitrum benefits\n\n* We\u2019ll provide the Arbitrum Foundation with a proposed template and agree on the exact format, clauses, and wording to be used.\n* The baseline template we envision is a contract that covers 3 scenarios: equity fundraising (SAFE) + protocolisation and token launch (Token Warrant) + a side letter covering the scenario of the projects not fundraising nor issuing a token. TBC with the foundation.\n* The contract shall stipulate the division of proceeds between RnDAO and the Foundation, which we envision to be 50-50 (pending confirmation from the foundation).\n* The contract shall enable the Foundation to transfer the contract to an Arbiturm-affiliated entity of their choosing (e.g. CapCo).\n* If no agreement with the foundation is reached on the contract, the program will be discontinued and the funds returned minus any spent legal fees (max $2,500).\n\n# 8. Long-Term Vision\n\n* we can run more hackathons and incubation programs, further growing the business cluster\n* Successful execution will create a self-sustaining business cluster - a magnet that attracts more projects without our active contribution.\n\n# 9. Conclusion\n\nWith the Arbitrum CollabTech Hackathon, we\u2019ve successfully launched 15 projects in Arbitrum. Now we have the opportunity to keep fueling this momentum and pioneer investments in Arbitrum DAO.\n\nWe\u2019re open to questions and ready to bring this to a vote to gather your feedback. Based on the feedback received we\u2019ll refine the proposal before moving to an onchain vote.\n\n# 10.

    "description": "# Expand Tally Support for the Arbitrum DAO\n# [](#constitutional-non-constitutional-1)Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## [](#abstract-2)Abstract\n\nTally has contributed to the Arbitrum DAO as a service provider since the DAO was created one year ago, serving as the home for [onchain governance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), [security council elections](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/0/round-2), and [delegation](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates). We\u2019ve gathered feedback about how we can improve our support for Arbitrum through many conversations over the past year with DAO stakeholders including delegates, contributors, and Foundation representatives. We propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by researching specifications for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n## [](#motivation-3)Motivation\n\nArbitrum is the largest and most decentralized DAO in the world. Tally is highly invested in the success of both the Arbitrum DAO specifically and the Arbitrum community as a whole. We have a strong track record as an Arbitrum governance service provider, [ecosystem builder](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tally-final-stip-round-1/17557), and [delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth). Tally continuously ships improvements for the Arbitrum DAO, including [transfer actions](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1732425795262714363?s=20), [improved Safe support](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1714647532423561257?s=20), [proposal collaboration](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1743325532786168149?s=20), and the [nominee selection stage](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-changes-to-the-constitution-and-the-security-council-election-process/20856/9) of Security Council elections. This proposal would enable us to invest more resources into the Arbitrum DAO and scale up our impact.\n\nThe majority of the improvements outlined in this proposal are specific to Arbitrum\u2019s unique implementation of onchain governance and will not be re-used in other DAOs. We are long-term partners to the Arbitrum DAO who plan to continue investing specifically in making Arbitrum governance great.\n\n## [](#rationale-4)Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive, technically inclusive, and user-focused. Our proposed improvements make it easier for contributors of all backgrounds and technical abilities to engage with Arbitrum governance.\n\n## [](#specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5)Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\nWe propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by developing a specification for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n**Improve the proposal process**\n*Watch a demo video* [here](https://youtu.be/yORl1yZPt7Q) *- note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Link forum proposal posts and Tally proposals so that delegates can create Tally proposals from forum posts, see forum proposal comments directly on Tally, and be updated by a Tally Discourse bot when onchain proposals are created.\n  * In order to show posts on the proposal page, Tally would need [Embedding permission](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-discourse-comments-on-another-website-via-javascript/31963)\n  * In order to post \u201cthis proposal is now onchain (link)\u201d, the Tally Discourse bot would need an API key with topics.writepermission from <https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/admin/api/keys/new>\n* Build a diff checker into Tally proposals that shows what text has changed from Snapshot without having to click back over to Snapshot, to help delegates understand any relevant changes from the temp check phase to the onchain governance phase.\n* Enable cancel functionality on Tally proposals so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes. (see upgrade Governor contracts section)\n* Develop full proposal execution integration by dynamically showing [each phase of proposal execution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal#the-lifecycle-of-an-arbitrum-improvement-proposal) with accurate time stamps so that contributors and delegates can easily manage proposals through the execution process.\n* Improve support for [late quorum extension](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#late-quorum-extension) on Tally so onchain proposals are automatically extended on Tally when late quorum extension is triggered.\n* Fully integrate the [quorum of each Governor](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-faqs#what-determines-the-quorum-minimum-votes-required-for-a-governance-proposal) throughout Tally, including on the proposal page and the delegates page so that delegates always know exactly how much voting power is required to reach quorum.\n* Show [Security Council](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council#the-role-of-the-security-council) transactions on the main [Arbitrum DAO page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) on Tally so the DAO can easily view actions taken by the Security Council.\n\n**Upgrade Governor contracts**\n*We\u2019re planning to partner with* [Scopelift](https://scopelift.co/) *to implement the upgrades. Scopelift is the developer of Flexible Voting and has deep experience with high-value governance contract upgrades.*\n\n* Add a [cancel() function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/92ff025622cdf6694318fc11af1c995236793a77/contracts/governance/Governor.sol#L455-L473) to the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s implementation of OpenZeppelin Governor so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes.\n* Add [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) to the Arbitrum DAO Governors to enable future innovations like voting from Orbit chains, voting from DeFi contracts, and shielded voting.\n\n**Highlight delegate contributions**\n*Watch a demo video* [here](https://youtu.be/WY1jQ2tP70U) *- note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Integrate [Karma\u2019s](https://www.karmahq.xyz/) delegate score and contributor metrics into Tally\u2019s delegate page so token holders and DAO stakeholders have access to holistic participation information. Karma will provide the following via their API:\n  * Onchain and Snapshot voting pct, delegator count, voting power, list of delegators\n  * Stats for different timeframes: Lifetime, last 30 days, last 90 days etc\n  * Various sorting criteria (score, voting power, voting pct, forum activity)\n  * Onchain endorsements by peer delegates\n  * Updates to the scoring logic if needed (Based on community feedback)\n  * Software maintenance and keeping data updated on daily basis\n\n**Research to set the DAO up for long-term success**\n\n* Research a partial delegation solution so that token holders can delegate to more than one address.\n* Research a solution for shielded onchain voting so that large delegate voting does not influence other voters during the voting or election period. Ensure that this solution applies to Security Council elections.\n\n## [](#timeline-6)Timeline\n\nResearch and Design: 0.5 months\n\nDevelopment: 2 months\n\nTesting, audit, and deployment (includes DAO proposal): 2 months\n\n**Total:** 4.5 months\n\n## [](#overall-cost-7)Overall Cost\n\nImprove the proposal process: $120,000 USD in ARB&#x20;\n\nUpgrade Governor contracts: $50,000 USD in ARB (100% will go to Scopelift)&#x20;\n\nHighlight delegate contributions: $40,000 USD in ARB&#x20;\n\n* Tally: $20,000 USD in ARB\n* Karma: $20,000 USD in ARB\n\nResearch to set the DAO up for long-term success: $10,000 USD in ARB&#x20;\n\n*The price of ARB at the time of onchain proposal creation was used to determine the amount of ARB to include in the transactions in this proposal.*\n\n**Total:** $220,000 USD in ARB\n\n*special thanks to the DAO Ops Excellence team at GovHack who helped moved this proposal forward* [@shawn16400](/u/shawn16400)\\*\\* [@hiringdevs.eth](/u/hiringdevs.eth) [@hung-vu](/u/hung-vu) [@cbxm](/u/cbxm)"

    "description": "# [Constitutional AIP] Activate Arbitrum BoLD + Infura Nova Validator Whitelist \n# Abstract\n\nThis constitutional AIP proposes upgrading both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to use a new dispute resolution protocol, called Arbitrum BoLD, and the addition of Infura to Arbitrum Nova\u2019s validator whitelist. Specifically, this AIP combines the following two temperature check votes:\n\n## [**<u>BoLD - permissionless validation for Arbitrum</u>**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x98a2b1eebda641b31d7d22a60708840ec7899157e00a4028f2e9f3030ddaf7a8)\n\nThis proposal requests the ArbitrumDAO to approve the upgrade of Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to utilize Arbitrum BoLD: a new dispute resolution protocol that is designed to replace the currently deployed dispute resolution protocol. If this upgrade is approved, validators on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova can use Arbitrum Nitro software to post assertions and to challenge invalid assertions. Note validation will be permissionless on Arbitrum One but remain permissioned on Arbitrum Nova (also elaborated on further down in this proposal).\u00a0\n\nThis upgrade will ensure that any single honest party can always successfully defend against malicious claims to an Arbitrum chain\u2019s state. Arbitrum BoLD represents the next step on the journey to having the Arbitrum technology stack being recognized as a [<u>Stage 2 Ethereum rollup</u>](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571).\u00a0\n\nThe implementation of BoLD has been thoroughly tested and audited to ensure both its effectiveness and safety. Note that Orbit chains may choose to adopt Arbitrum BoLD as soon as the BoLD upgrade is generally available and formally supported, regardless of whether the ArbitrumDAO approves this proposal or not.\n\n\n\n## [**<u>Whitelist Infura\u2019s Nova Validator</u>**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xaa831b9306c3ec4f4a9b9731e7c445e540e5a24461a79f1166cb8dcdfa692d09)\n\nThis proposal requests that the ArbitrumDAO whitelist Infura\u2019s Nova validator.\n\nThe addition of Infura to Arbitrum Nova\u2019s validator whitelist will increase the number of active validators on Arbitrum Nova, enhancing the network\u2019s overall security, stability, and reliability. Infura has a proven track record in running blockchain infrastructure and has already been participating on Arbitrum Nova\u2019s Data Availability Committee (DAC), but was not previously whitelisted as a validator.\u00a0\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO should consider approving this AIP because both the adoption of Arbitrum BoLD and the whitelisting of Infura\u2019s Arbitrum Nova validator will enhance the network\u2019s security, stability, and resiliency. Both of these proposed changes will benefit all Arbitrum users, Arbitrum node operators, dApps on Arbitrum, and Arbitrum bridges.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSpecifically, passing this governance proposal would mean that Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova will gain the following benefits:\n\n* **Permissionless validation** **for Arbitrum One** - Today, the critical role of being a validator for Arbitrum One is currently restricted to a permissioned set of validators in order to prevent [<u>delay attacks</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a) on the current rollup protocol - a class of attacks where malicious actors can delay assertion confirmations if they, the malicious actors, are willing to sacrifice their stakes. However, since BoLD mitigates the risks of delay attacks using a different mechanism (i.e. by enforcing a fixed upper time bound on dispute resolution), reliance on a permissioned set of validators is no longer necessary. Therefore, passing this AIP and implementing BoLD to secure Arbitrum One would effectively enable permissionless validation, marking a key milestone for Arbitrum chains to be recognized as [<u>Stage 2 Rollups</u>](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), a critical part of Arbitrum\u2019s [<u>journey to full decentralization</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization). Please see the [<u>dedicated section and recommendation for Arbitrum Nova below</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Spt82k_wfCsYqljolpNUm8FdF8T3akCv11Wjyh8YLc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.kdg6eaubi81k).\n* **Fixed delay time for assertion confirmation** - The current dispute protocol for Arbitrum chains has a ~6.4 day challenge period, during which validators can dispute claims about the chain\u2019s state. These claims about the chain\u2019s state are called \u201cassertions\u201d. While assertions are confirmable after 1 challenge period, malicious actors can open many challenges to delay confirming these assertions in a type of attack known as a [<u>delay attack</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a). BoLD guarantees that all assertions, if there is a dispute using the validating bridge contract, will be confirmed within a fixed time window of 2 challenge periods (~6.4 days each), 2 day grace period for the Security Council to intervene, and a small delta for computing challenges.\n* **Increased censorship resistance for Orbit L3s settling to Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova** - As mentioned in the original [<u>Arbitrum BoLD Forum Post</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs/pull/1766), the initial release of BoLD will come with a feature called \u201dCensorship Timeout\u201d (originally called \u201cDelay Buffer\u201d). The Censorship Timeout feature provides stronger guarantees of censorship resistance for Arbitrum chains - especially those that settle to Arbitrum One and Nova - by introducing a programmatic way for the parent chain contracts to lower the force inclusion time window in cases where the L2 sequencer is offline or censoring. For Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, it is proposed that this feature be enabled by default alongside BoLD\u2019s upgrade. Please see the dedicated section on [<u>Censorship Timeout</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Spt82k_wfCsYqljolpNUm8FdF8T3akCv11Wjyh8YLc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.tsldt625ikrm) for more details.\n* **Preserves the current security primitives with a Safety-First approach** - In the event of a dispute using BoLD, there is a 2 day \"grace period\" (also called the \u201cchallenge grace period\u201d) that is applied to the winning assertion before it is confirmed. This time window allows time for the [<u>Security Council</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council) to intervene if there are any severe bugs in the BoLD contracts that would cause an invalid assertion to confirm.The duration of the grace period is configurable by the ArbitrumDAO and would initially be set to 2 days.\u00a0\n* **Improved network stability and reliability for Arbitrum Nova with the addition of a new validator to the whitelist** - The addition of Infura to Arbitrum Nova\u2019s validator whitelist will increase the number of active validators on Arbitrum Nova, enhancing the network\u2019s overall security, stability, and reliability. Infura has a proven track record in running blockchain infrastructure and has already been participating on Arbitrum Nova\u2019s Data Availability Committee (DAC), but was not previously whitelisted as a validator.\u00a0\n\n# Rationale\n\nEnabling permissionless validation is a critical milestone on [<u>Arbitrum's journey toward full decentralization</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization), while maintaining network resiliency. These milestones help ensure Arbitrum technology remains the industry-leading choice for Ethereum scaling solutions. BoLD directly benefits users through guaranteed withdrawal times and enhanced security, while allowing anyone to participate in network validation. Meanwhile, the addition of Infura\u2019s validator to the Arbitrum Nova whitelist will increase the number of active validators on Arbitrum Nova, enhancing the network\u2019s overall reliability.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, this AIP is:\n\n* **Ethereum-aligned:** BoLD would strengthen Arbitrum One's connection to Ethereum by leveraging its security while making validation accessible to everyone - matching Ethereum's core value of openness. Similarly, the addition of Infura\u2019s validator to the Arbitrum Nova whitelist would support Ethereum's commitment to decentralization by supporting a more diverse validator set.\n* **Sustainable:** BoLD is meant to secure Arbitrum chains sustainably in the long-term, and there are already future investments and research expected following the initial launch to ensure BoLD and its security guarantees evolve alongside the Arbitrum protocol, technology, and community. Lastly, by leveraging Infura\u2019s proven infrastructure, the proposal would help ensure long-term operational stability and network reliability for Arbitrum Nova.\n* **Secure:** BoLD significantly enhances Arbitrum's and rollup chains' security by allowing more validators to monitor the network while maintaining Ethereum's robust security guarantees. Meanwhile, expanding the validator set for Arbitrum Nova will allow the ArbitrumDAO to reap the benefits from Infura\u2019s strong track record in blockchain infrastructure, adding an additional layer of trust and security to the network.\n* **Socially inclusive:** Permissionless validation using BoLD would allow any entity, individual, or team in the community to participate in securing Arbitrum One. Validation is not restricted to a single address, as BoLD considers all entities that are proposing honest claims to be part of the same team. Where one honest validator may fall off, another one can take up its same responsibility. Similarly, by expanding validator participation through the addition of Infura to Arbitrum Nova\u2019s validator whitelist, the proposal encourages greater inclusion and representation in the ecosystem.\n* **Technically inclusive:** The BoLD protocol specification is publicly available [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/BOLDChallengeProtocol.pdf). The technology is permitted for use by anyone (i.e. permissionless) for the sole purpose of operating and developing an [<u>Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation.</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/Arbitrum%20Expansion%20Program%20Jan182024-4f08b0c2cb476a55dc153380fa3e64b0.pdf) Meanwhile, expanding Arbitrum Nova\u2019s validator set to include Infura will enable more ordinary teams and users to benefit from Infura\u2019s robust infrastructure and expertise for their needs with no increase in hardware requirements or engineering changes for projects.\n* **User-focused:** Users and developers would receive immediate security and withdrawal timing benefits with BoLD, requiring zero changes to their existing applications or workflows. As for the addition of Infura Arbitrum Nova\u2019s validator set, developers and users alike will collectively benefit from improved network reliability and performance without additional overhead or complexities.\n* **Neutral and open:** BoLD has been and will continue to be \u201cbuilt in the public\u201d, in line with how [<u>Orbit</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/concepts/public-preview-expectations#how-products-like-orbit-are-developed-at-offchain-labs) and [<u>Stylus</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/public-preview-expectations#how-products-are-developed-at-offchain-labs) operate. This AIP is made in good faith to be neutral, transparent, factual, and open for anyone in the community to critique and inspect. Similarly, the proposal to add Infura\u2019s validator to Arbitrum Nova\u2019s whitelist was made transparently, fairly, and in good faith for the Arbitrum community - following the rules and guidelines set forth by the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s constitution.\n\n# Arbitrum BoLD: Implementation, Formal Specification, and Censorship Timeout\n\nThe following link, [<u>BoLD Implementation Deep Dive</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf), explains how BoLD is implemented and how it works at a high level. To read about the formal specification and mathematical safety proofs for the protocol, check out the [<u>official BoLD whitepaper</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491). Additionally, the following link, [<u>Economics of Disputes in Arbitrum </u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/bold/bold-economics-of-disputes)[<u>BoLD</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf), presents the nuances and details around the economics in the current proposed design of BoLD. The section on the Economics of Disputes in Arbitrum BoLD covers topics such as: why bonds are important, how bond sizes were calculated, how to think about their magnitude in the context of designing a dispute resolution protocol and various ways the system is designed to ensure honest parties are incentivized to participate in challenges.\n\n## **Censorship Timeout**\n\nAs mentioned in the original [<u>Arbitrum BoLD Forum Post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/70?), the initial release of BoLD will come with a feature called \u201dCensorship Timeout\u201d (originally called \u201cDelay Buffer\u201d). For Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, it is proposed that this feature be enabled by default alongside BoLD\u2019s upgrade.This feature aims to limit the negative effects of:\n\n* Prolonged sequencer censorship, and/or,\n* Unexpected Sequencer outages.\n\nTo explain how this feature improves the security of Arbitrum Orbit L3s settling to Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, consider the scenario where an L3\u2019s parent chain sequencer (the L2 sequencer) is censoring or offline. In such a case, every assertion and/or sub-challenge move would need to wait 24 hours before they could bypass the L2 sequencer (using the SequencerInbox\u2019s forceInclusion method described [<u>here</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/sequencer#unhappyuncommon-case-sequencer-isnt-doing-its-job)). In this scenario, challenge resolution would be delayed by a time *t* where *t = (24 hours) \\* number of moves for a challenge*. To illustrate with sample numbers, if a challenge takes 50 sequential moves to resolve, then the delay would be 50 days.\n\nThe Censorship Timeout feature mitigates this by implementing a time threshold that is decremented when unexpected delays in assertion posting occur due to one (or all) of the above mentioned cases of censorship or sequencer outage. Once that time threshold is met, the force inclusion window is lowered - effectively enabling entities to make moves without the 24 hour delay-per-move.\n\nUnder reasonable parameterization, the sequencer could be offline or censoring for 24 hours twice before the force inclusion window is effectively dropped from 24 hours to a minimum inclusion period. The force inclusion window gradually (over weeks) replenishes to its original value over time as long as the sequencer is on \u201cgood behavior\u201d. An example of \u201cgood behavior\u201d could be the default and normal sequencing of messages without unexpected delays.\n\n\n\nBelow are the initial, proposed parameter values for the Censorship Timeout feature:\u00a0\n\n* delay buffer = 14400 L1 blocks (2 days)\n* threshold = 150 L1 blocks (30 minutes) for Arbitrum One and 300 L1 blocks (1 hour) for Arbitrum Nova\n* replenish rate = 5% (meaning 1 day is replenished every 20 days, or roughly a 95% uptime)\n\nWe believe that the Censorship Timeout feature provides stronger guarantees of censorship resistance for Arbitrum chains - especially those that settle to Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. As always, Orbit chain owners can change the default parameters as they see fit for their use case.\n\nCensorship Timeout was not specifically elaborated on in the [<u>original temperature check which passed on Snapshot</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x98a2b1eebda641b31d7d22a60708840ec7899157e00a4028f2e9f3030ddaf7a8) but was [<u>mentioned in the original AIP forum post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/70?); we want to ensure that this important feature gets highlighted by adding it to this proposal text.\n\n\n\n## **Recommendation for Arbitrum Nova\u2019s use of BoLD**\n\nIn addition to proposing that\u00a0 both Arbitrum One and Nova upgrade to use BoLD, we also recommend the removal of the [<u>allowlist of validators for Arbitrum One while keeping Nova permissioned with a DAO-controlled allowlist of entities</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#allowlisted-validators) - unchanged from today for Nova. This update was made for two reasons:\n\nFirst, Arbitrum Nova\u2019s TVL is much lower than Arbitrum One\u2019s TVL, (~$45.48M vs. ~$18.99B at the time of writing Dec 27 2024, from [<u>L2Beat</u>](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary)). This means that the high bond sizes necessary for preventing spam and delay attacks would make up a significant proportion of Nova\u2019s TVL, which we believe introduces a centralization risk as we would expect that very few parties would be incentivized to secure Nova. A solution here would be to lower the bond sizes, which brings us to the second reason: lower bond sizes reduce the costs of delay attacks (where malicious actors delay the chain\u2019s progress) and therefore hurt the security of the chain. We believe enabling permissionless validation for Nova is not worth the capital requirement tradeoffs, given the unique security model of AnyTrust chains.\n\nNotably, since Arbitrum Nova\u2019s security already depends on at least one Data Availability Committee (DAC) member providing honest data availability, trusting the same committee to have at least one member provide honest validation does not add a major trust assumption. In the case where the entire DAC is also validating the chain, a feature the Offchain Labs team has been working on, Fast Withdrawals, would allow users to withdraw assets from Arbitrum Nova in ~15 minutes (effectively the same amount of time for L1 finality). This is made possible by the DAC attesting to and instantly confirming an assertion. We understand that Fast Withdrawals will be the subject of a separate AIP.\n\n# Addition of Infura\u2019s validator to Arbitrum Nova\u2019s validator whitelist: Implementation details\n\nThis proposal includes an on-chain action that will be executed, via a [<u>governance action contract</u>](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/tree/main/src/gov-action-contracts), to add Infura\u2019s validator address to Arbitrum Nova\u2019s validator whitelist. For posterity, Infura\u2019s validator address is: 0x0fF813f6BD577c3D1cDbE435baC0621BE6aE34B4.\n\n\n\nIncluded in the proposal payload is a call to the [<u>SetValidatorsAction</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf94afebfbf062a88615bc012da39d0822670aba#code) with Infura\u2019s validator address. This action will be executed immediately after the primary BoLD Upgrade Action to set Infura as a whitelisted validator in the new Arbitrum Nova rollup contract.\n\n# Technical risks\n\nSome of the technical risks of the BoLD upgrade include:\n\n* Issues preventing liveness of challenges due to smart contract bugs in the new contracts. For instance, no honest validator is able to make a move when it should be able to;\n* Safety issues where a malicious party is able to game the system and win due to logic errors in smart contracts;\n* Logic bugs in the assertion smart contracts that could affect assertion confirmation and posting, which could delay withdrawals until it is fixed; and\n* Bugs in bonding logic in the smart contracts that could lead to loss of funds due to logic errors in the Arbitrum Rollup and challenge manager smart contracts.\n\n<!---->\n\n* Bugs in the one step proof logic: BoLD does not change how one step proofs work for Arbitrum chains.\n\n\n\nSome of the technical risks that come with adding Infura\u2019s validator to Arbitrum Nova\u2019s validator whitelist are:\n\n* Bugs in the SetValidatorsAction that could cause the whole upgrade to revert.\n* An incorrectly specified validator address could cause the wrong validator to be whitelisted.\n\n\n\n# Implementation Plan\n\nBoLD\u2019s implementation has now been complete and merged into the Arbitrum Nitro codebase as of [<u>Nitro v3.3.0</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/) and [<u>nitro-contracts 3.0.0</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/282). The BoLD dispute protocol is now deployed on a permissionless public testnet as of April 15, 2024 that settles to Ethereum Sepolia and has also been deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia as of Dec 11, 2024. Should this governance proposal pass, the target timelines for BoLD to get activated on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is expected to be on Feb 12, 2025 between GMT-5 09:00 to 12:00.These dates are tentative targets that will depend on the governance vote outcome.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost for this proposal to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n# References\n\n* [<u>BoLD Gentle Introduction</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/bold/bold-gentle-introduction)\n* [<u>BoLD whitepaper</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491), containing both the formal specification & mathematical safety proofs\n* [<u>BoLD Implementation Deep Dive</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/bold/concepts/bold-technical-deep-dive)\n* [<u>BoLD Economics Deep Dive</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/bold/bold-economics-of-disputes)\n* [<u>Announcement blog for BoLD</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-bold-testnet-live-the-next-step-in-decentralization-2a6cd39e9bba)\n* Solutions to delay attacks on Optimistic Rollups, a blog that highlights a core motivation behind BoLD\u2019s development: [<u>Solutions to Delay Attacks on Rollups | by Offchain Labs | Offchain Labs | Medium</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a)\n* [<u>Audit by Trail of Bits (Aug 2, 2023)</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/audits/TrailOfBitsAudit.pdf), covering the first implementation of BoLD, based on the first design\u00a0\n* [<u>Audit by Trail of Bits (May 2, 2024)</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf), covering the new BoLD protocol contracts, assertion pooling contract, and changes to the sequencer inbox for the Censorship Timeout feature (then called \u201cDelay Buffer\u201d)\n* [<u>Audit Report by Code4rena</u>](https://code4rena.com/reports/2024-05-arbitrum-foundation) (June 17, 2024), from the public audit competition\n* [<u>Audit Report by Trail of Bits (Aug 5, 2024)</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-06-offchain-labs-bold-dac-rewards-updates-securityreview.pdf), covering fixes (from the previous audit) and additional optimizations made to the Arbitrum BoLD Solidity contracts.\n* [<u>Audit Report by Trail of Bits (Oct 7, 2024</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-10-offchain-bold-optimized-history-commit-securityreview.pdf)), covering specific optimizations to make BoLD\u2019s history commitments functions more efficient using fuzzing and differential testing techniques.\u00a0\n* [<u>Audit Report by Trail of Bits (Oct 30, 2024)</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/assets/files/2024_10_30_trail_of_bits_security_audit_Nitro_Contracts_with_BoLD-90984d87c800f448601b84972e544e1d.pdf), covering further optimizations and changes to the Arbitrum BoLD Solidity contracts, including the review of potential impacts downstream of changes to support EIP-7702.\n* [<u>Audit Report by Trail of Bits (Dec 26, 2024)</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-12-offchain-boldfixes-securityreview.pdf), covering the BoLD upgrade actions, BoLD proposal payload, and other various small changes as part of Nitro contracts v3.0.0\n\n## Where to Learn More about BoLD?\n\n* There have been two governance calls on this proposal to date. You can see the meeting recordings here: [<u>governance call #1</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h5GroqCAt9YY4fgFleHAlOUtZeotoIdX/view) and [<u>governance call #2</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L20e38nY_Fm_wLJvb8_TIncM4mVIq2A-/view)\n* Listen to the AMA recording on \u2018Uncovering BoLD & Permissionless Validation\u2019 that took place on April 18, here: [<u>x.com</u>](https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs/status/1780643417522901337)\n\n## BoLD FAQ Document\n\nFollowing conversations with many stakeholders in the ArbitrumDAO and the wider ecosystem, we have consolidated together a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and answers [<u>here</u>](https://www.notion.so/93210f430a6a470792496be040ac9990?pvs=21) about Arbitrum BoLD. This FAQ document will be iteratively updated as and when more common questions are raised.\n\n## Disclaimer about BoLD\u2019s upgrade\n\nIf this AIP is approved, the confirmation timing on any withdrawal that is in-progress when the proposed BoLD upgrade is activated will be delayed until the first BoLD assertion is confirmed. This means that for any Arbitrum Rollup chain that upgrades to use BoLD, including Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, all pending withdrawals to the parent chain, that were initiated before the upgrade, will be delayed by 1 challenge period, plus the time between when the withdrawal was initiated and the time that the BoLD upgrade takes place. This is because the upgrade would effectively \u201creset\u201d the challenge period for transactions that are not yet finalized at the time.\n\n\n\nFor example, if the upgrade happened at time *t*, then a withdrawal initiated at a time *t*-2 days would need to wait an additional 6.4 days to be finalized, totaling 8.4 days (6.4 + 2 days) of maximum delay. Withdrawals that finalize before the upgrade takes place at time *t* would be unaffected. In other words, the maximum delay a withdrawal will experience leading up to the upgrade would be 12.8 days (two challenge periods)."

In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.\n2. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n3. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & implementing a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized so as to assess a project\u2019s eligibility for the \u2018Subsidy Fund\u2019 referred to in point \\[b] above. This \u2018Means Test\u2019 (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in \\[b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.\n4. The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.\n5. The ADPC will be tasked with creating & communicating guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes & circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.\n\nThe ADPC will be composed of three \\[3] members that will facilitate & administer procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The appointment of ADPC members will be effected via an open election process via Snapshot\u2019s weighted voting system; wherein the first three \\[3] ranked members in the vote will be elected to the ADPC. Albeit not legally binding, when voting for prospective members of the ADPC, delegates & token holders alike should prioritize the following eligibility criteria so as to properly equip the ADPC to carry out its mandate.\n\n**\\[ii] ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**\n\nAlbeit not being legally binding, prospective voters looking to assess election applicants should in-principle conduct their assessments in light of these criteria.\n\nExperience\n\n* A demonstrated knowledge of procurement principles & best practices;\n* In-depth knowledge of procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time;\n* At least 3 years experience in Legal, Operations or Administrative role.\n\nIntegrity\n\n* Disclosure of any involvement in ethical breaches, fraud, manipulation, or other forms of misconduct, whether in the past or present.\n* Failure to provide accurate and complete disclosure of such information will result in the forfeiture of the applicant\u2019s eligibility upon the discovery of this information.\n\nConflicts of Interest and Independence of Mind\n\n* Disclosure is required for any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may emerge upon being selected for the role applied for.\n* This includes any factors that may impair one\u2019s ability to carry out decisions with sound, objective, and independent judgment.\n\nIndustry Knowledge\n\n* A comprehensive grasp of industry-specific service procurement challenges, procurement frameworks, and prevailing best practices.\n* Previous experience drafting governance proposals.\n\nAnalytical Skills for Service Contracts\n\n* Robust analytical capabilities for evaluating and negotiating service contracts, including service-level agreements (SLAs) and performance metrics.\n* The ability to identify and assess risks associated with service procurement decisions.\n\nFinancial Acumen (Service Costs)\n\n* A firm grounding in financial aspects of service procurement, including budgeting, cost analysis, and financial implications.\n\nCommunication Skills\n\n* Exceptional communication abilities, both oral and written, for interactions with service providers, stakeholders, and fellow committee members.\n* The capacity to convey complex service procurement information clearly and effectively.\n\nNegotiation\n\n* A high degree of proficiency in negotiating service agreements and SLAs to secure favorable terms, pricing structures, and quality standards with service providers should the need arise.\n* The ability to build and maintain positive relationships with service providers.\n\nProject Management Abilities\n\n* Proficiency in project management related to service procurement, including project planning, execution, and performance monitoring.\n* The capability to manage timelines, resources, and deliverables effectively for service projects.\n\nEthical Conduct\n\n* An unwavering commitment to ethical conduct in all service procurement activities, ensuring transparency and fairness in service provider whitelisting & facilitation.\n\nTeam Player\n\n* The ability to function effectively as a team player within the committee and collaborate with other organizational departments, stakeholders, and service providers.\n* Willingness to consider diverse perspectives and reach consensus on service procurement decisions.\n\nTechnology Proficiency\n\n* Familiarity with service procurement software and tools for managing service procurement processes, data analysis, and reporting.\n* Previous experience with Asana/Airtable.\n* Previous experience with Multi-Sigs.\n\nDecision-Making Skills\n\n* Sound judgment and decision-making skills to make informed and strategic service procurement choices aligned with the organization\u2019s service procurement strategy.\n\n**\\[iii] ELECTION PROCESS**\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ADPC Members \\[REF:\u00a0[The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs\u00a01](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)]. Hereunder, we propose an adapted model of Section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to implement in the ADPC Elections.\n\nThe ADPC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the ratification of the on-chain proposal that will secure the funding for the ADPC.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has been finalized.\n\nAll ADPC committee members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ADPC \\[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions in the Checks & Balances section].\n\nThere will be one election with the first three \\[3] ranking members in the weighted voting Snapshot being elected to the ADPC.\n\n**\\[iv] PROCEDURE & ELECTION TIMELINE**\n\n1. Application Submission (T+7 business days):\n\nAnyone may submit an application on a dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums in conformity with the application template stipulated hereunder;\n\n1. KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period (7 business day period following the end of Application Submission Period):\n\nApplicants who would have validly submitted their applications in conformity with the application template will then be required to undergo KYC/KYB processes. All candidates will cooperate with the Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates who fail the compliance process. Only applicants who pass KYB/KYC will be eligible for the ADPC election.\n\n1. Member election (7 business day period following the end of KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period):\n\nA Snapshot with weighted voting will be put up, including the list of all eligible candidates. The three \\[3] highest voted candidates will be elected to the Procurement Committee.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may approve and implement a Non-Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future ADPC elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.\n\n**\\[v] ELECTION APPLICATION TEMPLATE**\n\nApplicant Information:\n\nName of Applicant & Applicant\u2019s Representative \\[If Applicable]:\n\nEmail Address:\n\nTelegram Handle (if applicable):\n\nLinkedIn Profile (if applicable):\n\nPrimary languages spoken:\n\nDisclosure of other time commitments:\n\nExperience\n\n\\[Refer to Eligibility Criteria] Please provide a brief overview of your experience in the digital asset industry and, more specifically, the Ethereum & Arbitrum Ecosystems.

This package includes a monthly stipend of 7,500ARB to support them in their roles and responsibilities within the ADPC.\n\n**TERM**\n\nThe duration of the ADPC\u2019s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal that funds the ADPC is approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n**OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ADPC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ADPC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ADPC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ADPC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ADPC progress. These dashboard will also grant applicants going through the procurement process insight into internal timelines & progress, thus ensuring a high degree of transparency operationally.\n\n**ADPC \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ADPC\u2019s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* DisruptionJoe \\[Plularity Labs]\n* [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3)\u00a0\\[Premia Finance]\n* [@limes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/limes)\n* [@KlausBrave](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave)\n* Dan \\[Vela]\n\nThe ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ADPC\u2019s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.\n* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.\n\n**CHECKS & BALANCES**\n\nThe ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.\n\nThe Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:\n\nAppointment & Termination: ADPC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.\n\n* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:\n\n\u201cArbitrum Community\u201d means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \\[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \\[[$1.38 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances)].\n\n* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:\n\n\u201cArbitrumDAO Consent\u201d means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at\u00a0[The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs\u00a01](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)\u00a0(as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:\n\n1. [Snapshot\u00a02](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth)\u00a0(or any successor thereto); or\n2. another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.\n\nConflict of Interest Provision: ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Member\u2019s involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\nMandate & Purpose of the ADPC: The ADPC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ADPC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ADPC Mandate objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal.\n\nRecord-keeping and Reporting: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC\u2019s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.\n\nDuty of Impartiality: ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\nObligation of Recusal: ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation & administration of the applicable procurement process.\n\nProhibition of Self-Dealing: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\nEthical Trading: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets."

    "description": "# AIP - 3 [Non-Constitutional] Fund the Grants Framework Proposal Milestone 1\n**Proposer:** disruptionjoe.eth\n\n**Authors:** Plurality Labs\n\n# TL;DR\nThis proposal requests 3,360,000 ARB (0.07% of the total treasury) to fund the first of three milestones in a comprehensive plan to build an Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program.\n\n### Voting Options\n- Yes, fund Milestone 1 (3.36 million ARB)\n- No, do not fund Milestone 1\n- Abstain\n\nMilestone 1 is the start of this journey with a funding request that breaks down as follows:\n\n### Fund Allocation\n- 2.5 million ARB: Funding Ecosystem Development\n- 300k ARB: Matching Gitcoin Funding Pools which use Arbitrum\n\n**Total Funds to be Allocated = 2.8 million ARB**\n\n### Services\n- 336k ARB (12%): Plurality Labs Services\n- 224k ARB (8%): Grant Program Managers\n\n**Total Service Fees (20%) = 560k ARB**\n\n#### Proposal Total = 3,360,000 ARB\n\nSuccessful completion of these Milestone 1 deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem further establishing Arbitrum as the go to scaling solution for Ethereum. Plurality Labs is committing to being held accountable for the following Milestone 1 deliverables.\n\n# Deliverables\nAt the end of Milestone 1 (Est. March 2024), Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n### Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops\n\n- Conduct DAO native sensemaking to find the Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values\n- Clearly define funding priorities including short & long-term goals & boundaries\n- Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n- Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n- Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n### Design | Construct best-in-class Pluralistic Grants Program\n\n- Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n- Design and process map the end-to-end grant funding flows\n- Design approach, process, and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n- Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n- Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n- Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n- Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n### Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs\n\n- Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n- Deploy 2.5 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n- Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n- Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n### Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes\n\n- Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes, and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n- Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n- Collate community feedback and input on grants programs' efficacy and success\n- Evaluate, review, and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow its ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum\u2019s ability to actualize its full potential. It\u2019s easy to say, \u201cWe can solve these problems later\u201d, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n# Rational\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the \u201cbest of both worlds\".\n\nAt its core, the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefit the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming-specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs have struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n- Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n- Create a backlog of \u201chigh impact work to be done\u201d be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n- Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the \u201chigh impact work that needs to be done\u201d\n- Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and  Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n- Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n- Domain expertise and knowledge\n- Ability to source innovative grants projects and support in the maintenance of a healthy pipeline of grants submission\n- Maturity of program-specific processes and tooling\n- Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of the mechanism\n- Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n- This is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nThe Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\nThis is not a payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to match the funding pools of programs willing to run on Arbitrum. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users who might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into the support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n\n\n# Improved Accountability, Transparency, and Reporting\nImproved Accountability, Transparency, and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model. Web3 spends 100\u2019s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spending. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well as specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand-alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n# Multisig Management\n## Grants Safety Multisig\nOn Tally, the request is to send 3.36 million ARB to the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig.\n\narb1:0xC158b555F0B1ddd7F4D4f97Fd2a9acd144f8e0D4\n\nThe 4/6 which includes 4 delegates with over 500k ARB plus 2 Plurality Labs team members. \n\n### Signers include:\n\n**Delegates**\n- Frisson (6.59m)\n -Soby (5.33m)\n- Coinflipcanda (4.95m)\n- Nathan (680k)\n\n**Plurality Labs**\n- Disruption Joe\n- Shawn Grubb\n\nThere are two layers of community protection against misuse or abuse of funds.\n\n### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module\n\n- DAO can clawback funds from multisig direct to its treasury with a vote\n- Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers\n### Grants Safety Multisig Signers\n\n- A multisig protects from simple wallet hacks\n- Protects from having the service provider hold all the funds\n- Protects against obvious self dealing or abuse\n- Provides a more integrated delegate watching the program closely\n- Does not decide how funds are allocated - Only a signer\n- This multisig is set up with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally. (Quorum is set at 100 million ARB for non-constitutional vote)\n\n## Role of Signers and Governance \nThe role of the multisig signer is solely to protect and prevent fraud and abuse such as perceived \u201cself-dealing\u201d by Plurality Labs. They are not expected to actively participate in deciding where funds should be allocated.\n\nThis multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program.\n\nDuring our sessions with the community, we learned that there is not an expectation of any election or term limits for this multisig because it does not actively make any decisions. Instead the requirements should be large delegates (skin in the game), active (will actually sign in timely manner), and has reputation (wants to maintain positive impression).\n\n***This vote will enable the DAO at any time to set term limits or request elections and for that request to be executed within 30 days. Governance requests for the Grants Safety Multisig will only require a winning vote on snapshot which meets non-constitutional quorum.***\n\n## Plurality Labs Payment\nUpon receipt of 3.36 million ARB, the Grants Safety Multisig will send 30% of the Plurality Labs service fee to the Plurality Labs wallet: arb1:0x76Ae3Af25332F5cd01c312E281685Bb35D7d27eA\n\nThe remaining 70% will be streamed to the Plurality Labs wallet over a period of 6 months. This means that if the DAO believes Plurality Labs is performing poorly, they can even clawback the payment to Plurality Labs.\n\nWe also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n# Plurality Labs Team\n### Disruption Joe\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million. First Gitcoin employee to leave the company and work full-time for the DAO. Started the Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD) workstream. FDD is responsible for stopping over $3 million in fraud while Gitcoin Grants delivered over $50 million in funding.\n\nMore reading about the work done in the FDD Review. Joe will be supporting overall project management and grants framework design.\n\n### Pepperoni Jo3 (on behalf of r3gen.finance 2)\n\nCofounder of r3gen, a web3 financial service provider working with clients including Squid, Coordinape, Inverse Finance and Treasure DAO. Previously PwC consulting alumni specializing in Org Design, Operational Excellence and Change. Joined web3 full time at Index Coop where he served on the Leadership Council as Head of People and Community.\n\nMore information on the r3gen services and team can be found here 2.\n\n### Mary Quandt\n\nPeople-first strategic design-thinking and organizational development leader. Partners with global business leaders to accelerate business strategies and execute people- and organization-focused solutions.

Introduced to the blockchain in 2015 he went full-time degen in 2019 but moved to DAOs in 2021 when he joined Index Coop leading the governance communications and people operations. In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n# Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures\u2026 The same process will occur before Milestone 3.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. By the end of Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for the entire process to run autonomously onchain.\n\n## Milestone 3 - Completion of the full project\nWe expect this to take 18 months in total. Each milestone being a 6 month cycle of iterative improvement. At the end of the third milestone we will provide:\n\n### Metrics\n- The number of quality active developers building on Arbitrum is growing at an increasing rate. (The combination of a quality assessment and the nuance of an increasing rate of growth indicates healthy and sustainable growth.)\n- Voter participation is increasing as indicated by # of active ARB holders in participating in grants governance. (Participation, especially those buying ARB to participate, is a key indicator of ARB value as a governance token providing political decentralization.)\n- DAO delegates\u2019 satisfaction with Plurality Labs service is improving as measured by NPS. (The delegate\u2019s happiness with Plurality Labs service indicates success as viewed by the delegates.)\n\n### What will have been achieved?\n- Capture-resistant governance of the grants program which supports continuous and sustainable funding of the grants program going forward.\n- Ability to massively scale allocation amounts such that the DAO can comfortably allocate significant capital to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem by improving sourcing pipelines, standardizing evaluation models, and using multiple allocation methods appropriately aligned to outcomes.\n- Improvements in the DAOs ability to sense, make and drive impact and outcomes by bringing the right information to the right decision making apparatus in a way that cuts off poor performance and doubles down on high-impact work.\n\n# Voting Options\n- Yes, fund Milestone 1 (3.36 million ARB)\n- No, do not fund Milestone 1\n- Abstain\n\n# Reference Discussions\n\nForum Discussion https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976\n\nSnapshot Passed 7/18 https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xa0e14b85197d73e825ac30f72b7d895d644ed06159a32a578f4efe47a2739b2f"

    "description": "# Upgrade Governor Contracts by Transfering Timelock Roles to the New Governors\n### **Abstract**\n\nThis proposal will transfer the proposer and canceller roles from the current Arbitrum Core Governor and Arbitrum Treasury Governor to newly deployed Governor contracts. This roles transfer is a crucial step in upgrading the Arbitrum DAO's governance infrastructure.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThis upgrade to the Arbitrum DAO's governance system was initially discussed as part of the 'Expand Tally Support for the Arbitrum DAO' proposal\u00a0[here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387). The community recognized the need for enhanced governance features, including proposal cancellation and flexible voting mechanisms.\n\nAs a result of these discussions, new Governor contracts have been developed and deployed with these improvements. To activate these enhancements and complete the upgrade process, we now need to transfer the proposer role to these new contracts.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n1. Grant the newly deployed Core Governor and Treasury Governor contracts the 'PROPOSER\\_ROLE' and 'CANCELLER\\_ROLE' on the timelock contract.\n2. Revoke the current Core Governor and Treasury Governor contracts' 'PROPOSER\\_ROLE' and 'CANCELLER\\_ROLE' on the timelock contract.\n\n### **Technical Details**\n\n* **This proposal has a longer than usual L1 timelock delay of 10 days, so the existing governors can still be used for proposing until the voting period of this proposal has ended.**\n* The new Governor contracts have been deployed on Arbitrum One at the following addresses:\n  * Core Governor:\u00a0`0x7796F378B3c56ceD57350B938561D8c52256456b`\n  * Treasury Governor:\u00a0`0x4fd1216c8b5E72b22785169Ae5C1e8f3b30C19E4`\n* These new contracts include the following enhancements:\n  1. **Proposal Cancellation**: Allows the delegate who submitted a proposal to cancel it during the delay phase, before voting begins.\n  2. **Flexible Voting**: Enables delegates to cast rolling, fractional votes, supporting future innovations like voting from Orbit chains and more.\n* The new Governors maintain all existing features of the current Governors, including custom relay functionality and fractional quorum calculations.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nThe rationale for upgrading the Governors by granting and revoking roles on the Timelock contract instead of using the proxy upgradeable contract pattern is discussed in detail in\u00a0[this forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governance-smart-contract-upgrade-technical-details/24642).\n\n### **Security Considerations**\n\n* The [new Governor contracts](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/310) have been [tested and audited](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governor-v2-review/26118) by OpenZeppelin.\n* This transfer does not move any funds or change permissions on the Timelock contracts.\n* Historical governance actions will remain visible and valid.\n\n### **Post-Transfer Actions**\n\n* Immediately after this transfer executes, Tally will update to interface with the new Governor contracts.\n* Delegates should use the new Governor contracts for all future proposal submissions.\n* The old Governor contracts will remain on-chain but will no longer have the ability to execute proposals.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\nIf this proposal passes, the transfer will be executed immediately after the Timelock delay.\n\nBy approving this proposal, the Arbitrum DAO will upgrade its governance infrastructure, enabling new features and improvements in the governance process."

    "description": "# Grant Request - Curve Finance\nThis vote is to seek support for a standalone grant application by LlamaRisk on behalf of and to support the growth of Curve Finance on Arbitrum\n\nThis grant application is NOT part of LTIPP but has been designed to follow a similar model and is proposed to be distributed over a similar period.\u00a0 If this proposal is approved by the DAO and the LTIPP council is agreeable this proposal can fit within the monitoring of LTIPP as well.\n\n### Key Grant Information\n\n**Requested Grant Size**\n237,500 ARB\n\n**Grant Period**\n16 weeks\n\n**Grant Matching**\nMichael Egorov will donated 237,500 ARB from his personal ownership to match the arbitrum grant. The source of these tokens are from early personal investment into Arbitrum.\n\n**Grant Breakdown**\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish a deeply liquid borrowing and lending market for ARB tokens. The funds matched by the Arbitrum DAO will be used exclusively to bootstrap the supply side in the two ARB markets. The funds from Micheal Egorov are used for the crvUSD/ARB/CRV pool and upcoming LRT/WETH AMM pools. Possible LRT tokens are weETH (ether.fi), ezETH (Renzo) and reETH (KelpDAO), which have decent liquidity on arbitrum.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 8.36.34\u202fPM.png](ipfs://bafkreihn7esgqmy7jaqqz7bfkrdgsrsgsvqpf4do4253ojjvz26gjl4ct4)\n\nThe ARB will be deployed to the market/pool rewards as a supply incentive and direct LP incentive.\n\nOnce funds have been received, we will work with the Curve core team to deploy the grant. Distribution will begin shortly after the necessary markets have been deployed.\n\n\n\n**Note added, 9. May 2024**\n\nCurve\u2019s matching contribution of 237,500 donated by Michael Egorov has partly already commenced, to this date, 168\u2019000 ARB has being distributed directly in the following lending markets: ARB/crvUSD, WETH/crvUSD, WBTC/crvUSD, CRV/crvUSD.

    "description": "# Pilot Phase: M&A for Arbitrum DAO\nNon-constitutional\n\nPlease review the forum post for full proposal details:\u00a0<https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pilot-phase-m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23588>\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe 8-weeks M\\&A pilot phase proposal is the next step toward the Arbitrum M\\&A proposal outlining the opportunity for Arbitrum DAO to form an M\\&A Unit focused on identifying and executing on acquisition opportunities.\n\nThe overarching aim is to utilize M\\&A as a key growth driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem and to help the DAO expand non-organically through acquisition opportunities that are not accessible to competing ecosystems, thereby critically enhancing Arbitrum DAO's capital allocation methods.\n\nFull details on the M\\&A proposal, its operational processes and structure you can find in the [Arbitrum M\\&A Core Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23205 \"Arbitrum M\\&A Core Proposal\")\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe 8-week pilot phase is designed to provide the DAO with sufficient information to make an informed go/no-go decision regarding the further operationalization of the M\\&A unit and its funding requirements. It is the natural progression of a 6 weeks Working Group sprint to develop an initial structure of the M\\&A unit.\n\nIn addition to conducting an in-depth strategy study on the value upside of M\\&A, analyzing strategic target areas, aligning them with key stakeholders (both online and at the GovHack in Brussels), and providing exemplary analyses on targets, the pilot phase should serve as a facilitated platform for in-depth discussions based on data rather than opinions.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe dedicated goals of the pilot phase are the following:\n\n1. **Equip the DAO with sufficient knowledge** to make an informed decision about the operationalization of the fund.\n2. **Align the DAO on strategic target areas** by providing strategic analysis and coordinating key delegates and stakeholders.\n3. **Provide an orchestrated platform for discussion** of the efforts over an extended period of time to further sharpen the edges.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe initiative will be led by a dedicated team from Areta - the leading independent crypto-native investment bank specializing in M\\&A and complex financial transactions for some of the leading ecosystems in the crypto space with deep M\\&A transaction expertise and involvement in Arbitrum DAO.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nThe insights from the analyses will be condensed into an assessment report to be presented to the DAO. Further, the GovHack at EthCC will be used for status update and facilitation of a working session. The insights from the analyses will be condensed into an assessment report to be presented to the DAO, incl.:\n\n**1. Analysis of M\\&A value upside for Arbitrum DAO**\n\n* Arbitrum M\\&A value upside analysis, incl. benchmarking for the DAO\n* Assessment of tactical importance of M\\&A for the DAO, incl. activities that M\\&A will enable the DAO to engage in\n* Impact analyses of determined target areas\n\n**2. Development of strategic areas for Arbitrum DAO supported by in-depth analyses, incl. alignment of target areas with key stakeholders in the DAO**\n\n* In-depth strategic analyses of target areas, incl. financial and strategic upside to the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* Facilitating interactions across the DAO to present results of analyses and align stakeholders. Key part of these will be held at the GovHack in EthCC.\n\n**3. Analyses of target examples and presentation to the DAO**\n\n* Exemplary target identification on one target area to provide the DAO with a better understanding of what it would mean to have the M\\&A Mgmt Unit operate\n* Target analysis and example of outside-in due diligence process\n* Integration options per target in context of Arbitrum DAO\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe pilot phase (as detailed in the proposal) will entail an 8-week sprint structured into 3 work packages and underlying deliverables detailed out above.\n\n## **Overall Cost**\n\nOverall cost for the 8-weeks pilot phase will be $52k ARB, consisting of:\n\n* **Operational budget:** Minimal budget to cover cost for a lean team conducting the execution of outlined work packages: $25k ARB / month\n* **Access to Data Providers/Research Platforms:** $2k in ARB (remaining budget to be refunded to the DAO)\n\nReceiving wallet address: 0xd5c4E8dd598205045f406DC81b9e01E91005C912\n\nSafe MSig with 3 signers: Bernard Schmid (0x8F7A73A6e96fAb2C970bC4b76d236c3dCCD6e7Da); Karl-Martin (0xC6Dc0805c3e7cF1667f80F46bd9D5b1443280dBF); Jan-Philip Grabs (0x39B91ede1F2e7524207cDFB6823Be2a4f9B94012)\n\n## Helpful links:\n\n* M\\&A Core Proposal:\u00a0[here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23205)\n* M\\&A Working Group Progress:\u00a0[here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/start-of-arbitrum-m-a-working-group/22520)\n* M\\&A Telegram Group:\u00a0[here](https://t.me/+IjizbmkcAisyZTli)\n* Easy-to-digest Video Summary (s/o to Sinkas):\u00a0[here](https://twitter.com/Sinkas_/status/1784876301826073036)\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDefinitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to the proposal, new to the Arbitrum community, and/or industry-specific. This section is optional, but recommended.\n\n**Mergers & Acquisitions (M\\&A)**\n\nMergers and Acquisitions (M\\&A) involve the process of combining two companies into one or one company taking ownership of another. These transactions aim to create a more efficient and effective entity by leveraging synergies\n\n**Target**\n\nA target in M\\&A refers to the company that is being pursued for acquisition by another company, known as the acquirer. The acquisition typically results in a change of control of the target company, transferring ownership to the acquiring company.\n\n*Special thanks to @jacobpphillips and @hiringdevs.eth for sparking the initiative at the GovHack in Denver, and the WG members for their continuous support.*"

    "description": "# [Constitutional] AIP: Constitutional Quorum Threshold Reduction\n# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes a reduction of the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5%, lowering it from 5% to 4.5% of the [total Arbitrum votable tokens](https://dune.com/queries/4629041/7761813). The goal is to ensure that well-supported proposals can successfully conclude by aligning quorum requirements with current levels of voter participation, reducing the risk of legitimate initiatives failing due to quorum thresholds not being met.\n\nFor non-constitutional proposals, the existing 3% quorum threshold will remain unchanged.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past year, the 5% quorum threshold for constitutional proposals within the ArbitrumDAO has been challenging, despite support from a broad range of delegates. As the circulating supply of $ARB continues to grow and voter turnout remains relatively flat, quorum requirements are becoming increasingly difficult to meet.\n[ARDC research on governance risks analysis](https://loving-bank-303.notion.site/Part-2-Governance-Risks-Analysis-1b605ac99aec80c282c7fa0105f13ce7) suggest that quorum on constitutional proposals could reach 300M (in base case) in about a year, while participation rate as % of votable supply has gone down from 8% in early 2024 to 4-5% in early 2025. Reducing the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5% provides a short-term adjustment that enables critical governance to move forward while longer-term reforms are considered and developed.\n\n# Rationale\n\nArbitrumDAO is governed by the principles of decentralization, participation, and credible neutrality. This proposal balances those principles by modestly reducing the constitutional quorum threshold to better reflect the current governance environment without undermining the legitimacy of approved proposals. This proposal also would not require any upgrades to existing smart contracts, helping maintain community trust and operational simplicity.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction was selected as a conservative adjustment that is expected to meaningfully improve the likelihood of well-supported proposals reaching quorum, while still maintaining a high enough threshold to deter governance attacks.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Constitutional Proposal: A type of proposal within the ArbitrumDAO that modifies governance structures outlined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. These require higher quorum thresholds than non-Constitutional proposals.\n* Quorum: The minimum number of tokens required to participate in voting for a proposal to be valid and eligible to pass. In this context, it is calculated as a percentage of the total $ARB votable tokens.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThis proposal updates the constitutional quorum threshold from 5% of the total votable tokens to 4.5%.\n\nAs of April 2025, with ~4.3B ARB in votable tokens (formula is total supply of ARB token, which is 10B, minus the amount delegated to the [exclude address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a4b86)), the quorum reduction would decrease the requirement by approximately 25 million ARB tokens, bringing the effective quorum from ~215M to ~190M ARB.\n\nNo upgrades to core governance smart contracts are required. Instead, this proposal will include an action contract that uses existing functionality to modify the quorum constant used in the calculation of constitutional quorum thresholds. The action contract has been audited, [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-06-offchain-setcoregovernorquorumaction-securityreview.pdf).\n\nThe 0.5% reduction represents a minimal-risk, fast-to-implement interim solution, while other long-term solutions can be considered, such as flexible quorum, or franchiser contract.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe proposal will follow these steps:\n\n1. Forum discussion: This AIP is posted to the ArbitrumDAO forum for discussion and feedback from the community. \\[DONE]\n2. Temperature Check: An informal offchain vote is conducted on Snapshot to gauge community support. \\[DONE]\n3. On-Chain Vote: A formal Constitutional AIP and call-to-vote is proposed to Tally for the on-chain vote. This proposal itself will be subject to the existing 5% quorum to pass. \\[ON-GOING]\n4. Update Governance Parameters: If passed, the new 4.5% quorum requirement would take effect immediately for all future constitutional proposals.\n\nNo smart contract changes or audits are required, which reduces implementation complexity and cost.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThis AIP does not request any grant or budget allocation. It introduces no operational, technical, or recurring costs and does not require smart contract upgrades or audits. Governance configuration changes are handled via on-chain proposal execution and incur only the standard gas costs associated with DAO transactions."

Among the EL changes introduced are a way for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to execute smart contract code directly from their own addresses (via [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)) and new precompiles to efficiently perform operations over the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, including BLS signature verification (via [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)).\n\n*The ArbOS 40 \u201cCallisto\u201d upgrade is being proposed for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, and therefore, this specific proposal only impacts these two chains, as they are directly governed by the Arbitrum DAO.* On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be interpreted as Arbitrum\u2019s equivalent of a hard fork. More can be read about the subject in the [overview of ArbOS releases](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/overview). Please note that ArbOS version 40 \u201cCallisto\u201d builds upon [ArbOS version 32](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) (previously adopted by the Arbitrum DAO); the version number is incremented to 40 (instead of 33) due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability, as explained [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/overview).\n\n## Changes that will be included in ArbOS 40 \u201cCallisto\u201d:\n\n### [EIP-7702: Set EOA account code](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)\n\nEIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to set executable code at their own address, effectively adding account-abstraction functionality to EOAs. This enables features such as delegation, batching, transaction sponsorship, and sub-key permission control. ArbOS 40 implements full support for this new transaction type, bringing Arbitrum chains to feature parity with Ethereum\u2019s Pectra account abstraction changes.\n\n### [EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)\n\nThis EIP introduces a set of precompile contracts for performing cryptographic operations on the BLS12-381 curve, improving efficiency and enabling secure on-chain BLS signature verification. ArbOS 40 integrates this precompile, enabling smart contracts to use modern cryptographic primitives in line with Ethereum\u2019s upgraded capabilities.\n\n### [EIP-2935: Serve historical block hashes from state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)\n\nEIP-2935 proposes storing an extended window of recent block hashes in the Ethereum state. ArbOS 40 adapts this to store approximately 27 hours' worth of L2 block hashes, allowing for more accessible and trustless historical data retrieval.\n\n### Minor Stylus VM Caching Fix ([#2998](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2998))\n\nArbOS 40 includes a fix to the Stylus VM\u2019s handling of non-existent contracts in cache lookups. The fix is designed to make sure calls to `account_code` or `account_code_size` reflect the current state, even for addresses where a contract did not previously exist. This change is backward-compatible and does not increment the Stylus version.\n\n## Pectra Changes Not Included in ArbOS 40\n\nThe following EIPs from Ethereum\u2019s Pectra fork are not included:\n\n* **Consensus Layer EIPs** (EIP-6110, EIP-7002, EIP-7251, EIP-7549, EIP-7691): These pertain to the Ethereum Beacon Chain and are not applicable to Arbitrum\u2019s architecture.\n* [**EIP-7623: Increase Calldata Cost**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623): Although included in the Nitro codebase, support is disabled by default. ArbOwner precompiles allow optional enablement, but it is not activated in ArbOS 40.\n* [**EIP-7685: General Purpose Execution Layer Requests**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685): Not relevant due to Arbitrum\u2019s lack of a separate consensus layer.\n* [**EIP-7840: Add Blob Schedule to EL Config**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840): Arbitrum does not currently implement its own blob schedule or native blob transactions.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nAll of the above changes are implemented via a new ArbOS release and will be shipped via two separate upgrades: a Nitro node version upgrade and an update (to use the new WASM module root) within the on-chain rollup contracts for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal payload will contain the on-chain changes, including updating the WASM module root and scheduling the ArbOS Upgrade, and assumes that the Nitro node software for all node operators and validators for the network(s) are updated to a version that supports ArbOS 40 Callisto.\n\nAn independent, third-party audit by Trail of Bits has already been completed. The results from that audit have been published and can be found [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-04-offchainlabs-arbos40nitro-securityreview.pdf).\n\nNote that should this vote pass, the proposal payload [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/342) will trigger the activation of ArbOS 40 Callisto at epoch timestamp: `1750176000` which is Tuesday, June 17, 2025 4:00:00 PM (GMT) after the last step in the implementation process for Constitutional AIPs, as outlined [here](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal). This is so that large, complex upgrades (like ArbOS upgrades) can be done so when members from the Arbitrum Foundation, Offchain Labs, ArbitrumDAO Security Council, are available to assist if necessary.\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS 40 Code Difference\n\n[Click Here](https://www.notion.so/1f001a3f59f8800c8283e350cda357fb?pvs=21)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **\\[Completed] Forum Proposal and Snapshot Vote**: Initial proposal was posted [on the Arbitrum Forum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-arbos-version-40-callisto/28436?u=entropy). The temperature check vote on Snapshot received strong community support and was passed [here](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7cc26491a070c74c1a4ec5a9892571d31eb690015936a35b52c0d3a97bd5497f).\n2. **\\[Completed] Engineering Work**: Features are implemented in the Nitro codebase, including support for EIP7702, EIP2537, and EIP2935, and the Stylus caching fix. The engineering work also included smart contract code changes to the Rollup contracts to support ArbOS 40 (e.g. `nitro-contracts 3.1.0)`\n3. **\\[Completed] Security Audit**: Trail of Bits completed a successful audit; results were published, and can be found here: [https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports](https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports).\n4. **\\[Completed] Release Candidate**: Nitro v3.6.0 was released and is now available on Dockerhub as `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v3.6.0-fc07dd2.` The release notes can be found here and this version includes support for ArbOS 40 Callisto. This is not the final release for mainnet but is instead the first release that adds support for ArbOS 40 Callisto. The release notes can be found here: [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.6.0](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.6.0)Should this vote pass, the formal and recommended Nitro node version will be communicated to the community.\n5. **\\[Completed] Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet Deployment**: ArbOS 40 Callisto has been activated on Arbitrum Sepolia on May 5, 2025.\n6. **\\[This post] On-chain Vote**: A formal on-chain vote on Tally will be proposed and voted on by the ArbitrumDAO determine whether ArbOS 40 Callisto can be activated on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n7. **\\[Next] Upgrade Execution**: If the above on-chain vote is passed, the ArbOS 40 Callisto upgrade will be enacted following DAO governance procedures and activation timelines."

    "description": "# AIP 9: Arbitrum Short-term Incentive Program\nNote: This proposal has been drafted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created consensus framework to distribute up to 50,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through January 31, 2024. \n\nGranted funds are expected to be distributed by the end of January 31, 2024. Participating grantees will be expected to self report data, dashboards, and summarize grant performance on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis provisional framework aims to allow delegates to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed ([1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/4-arbitrum-open-governance-call-26-07-2023/15559), [2](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-now-a-pragmatic-approach-for-the-moment/15779), [3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/quit-shooting-the-dao-foundation-in-the-foot/15771/2), [4](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116)).\n\nThe goals of the framework are to:\n\n* **Support Network Growth**: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n* **Experiment with Incentive Grants**: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Find new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n* Create Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\nFollowing a successful [Snapshot Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5e0057920df9a278918e4de4ee1e6de7e2415d2af985e40a6c7a1a4b47a4ce01), the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply to delegates for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check achieved consensus and approved funding of up to 50,000,000 ARB through the end of January 31, 2024.\n\n## Financial Proposal\n\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n\n* A ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and [application template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544) as articulated in this document.\n* Approval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n* A 50,000,000 ARB distribution to the [STIP-ARB multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B).\n* A 94,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\n  * 20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n    * Draft and review of multiple iterations of the STIP framework.\n    * Moderation of community calls and working group telegram.\n    * Coordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\n   * 54,000 to ARB Multisig Signers (6,000 ARB per Signer).\n   * 20,000 ARB to StableLab streamed weekly for organizing and highlighting applications and managing review processes. This includes:\n        * Overseeing forum application and review stages.\n        * Monitoring progression of applications throughout the application and review process.\n        * Monitoring progression of applications throughout the application and review process.\n        * Collaboration with the Foundation for forum setup and oversight.\n       * Facilitation of Delegate x Grantee Community Calls during review periods.\n\n**Multisig Setup**\n\nThe [STIP-ARB 5/9 multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B) is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes the signers from the original PL-ARB multisig with the addition of to three community members (pending KYC):\n\n* Karel Vuong, Treasure DAO\n* Jack Sanniota, 404 DAO\n* Lindsey Winder, Hedgey Finance\n\nThis new multisig, the STIP-ARB multisig, includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1. Clawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n\n2. Streaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, *not punish bad designs*.\n\n## What are the Eligibility Requirements?\n\nGrant Requirements:\n\n* Grantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n* Grantees must not farm their own incentive programs. \n* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant's objective.\n* Grantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard .\n* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n* Grantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n* Grantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n* Grantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n* Grantees must apply using the approved program application [template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544). \n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n* Any use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n* Failure to comply with data reporting standards.\n  * Grantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n    * Dashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n    * More granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\n  * If dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\n\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds. \n\n## Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines\n\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\n\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there's no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\n\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n* Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n    * Meets one of the following criteria:\n      * .> $1.5M TVL.\n      * .>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n* Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n    * Meets one of the following criteria:\n      * .> $4M TVL.\n      * .>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n* Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n    * Meets one of the following criteria:\n      * .> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n      * .> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n* Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n    * Meets one of the following criteria\n      * .> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n      * .> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n# Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?\n\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\n### Cycle 1\n\n1. Application Period (1 Week):\n\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the \u201cIncentive Grant Applications\u201d Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application [Template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544).\n\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2. Review Period (1 Week):\n\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\n\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3. Voting Period (1 Week):\n\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\n\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\n### Cycle 2\n\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n# Projected Timeline \nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 10, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\nSep. 20, 2023 - On-Chain Vote Begins\n\nRound 1 \n* Application Date Starts: September 20, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Application Deadline: September 27, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Review Period Starts: September 28, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Review Period Deadline: October 3, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Voting Period Starts: October 4, 2023\n* Voting Period Deadline: October 11, 2023\n\nRound 2 (Subject to changes)\n* Application Date Starts: October 12, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Application Deadline: October 18, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Review Period Starts: October 19, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Review Period Deadline: November 01, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Voting Period Starts: November 2, 2023\n* Voting Period Deadline: November 09, 2023\n\n\n# Overall Cost\n50,094,000 ARB.\n\n# Outstanding Questions and Concerns\n\n**What happens if the budget is exceeded?**\n\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 50M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated based on the amount of votes in favor of a proposal, and then on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\n**What will happen to excess funds?**\n\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\n**What is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?**\n\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of empowering delegates to process incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\n\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\n**How does the program determine whether to halt funding streams?**\n\nFunds can be stopped by the STIP-ARB Multisig with a 5/9 consensus. Funds will be stopped in the event of negligent actions in violation of the previously defined grant requirements. If halted, the multisig must publish the justification of its decision on the Arbitrum Forum. The stream can restart either through a Snapshot Veto or if the multisig decides the grantee has corrected their actions and it\u2019s appropriate to continue.\n\n**What are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?**\n\n* **Community Support**: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n* **Network Activity**: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n* **Community Awareness**: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n* **Incentives Data**: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n\n***Regarding the StableLab Engagement** StableLab has offered to handle management of the forum process starting September 22, 2023 and has agreed to accept back pay (from the proposal's passing) via weekly streams forward through January 31, 2023. This arrangement was initiated due to their proactive outreach regarding a competitive rate and interest under unique time-constraints and circumstances. If at any point the multisig feels StableLab has not upheld diligence in its responsibilities the multisig is empowered to halt the stream and appoint a new service provided by election. \n\nFurther, due to these last-minute circumstances, the DAO is entitled to elect competitive service providers during the first voting round by signaling a competitive offer in this proposal thread. If a counteroffer(s) is endorsed by a delegate with over 500,000 ARB VP the DAO will hold an election for the remainder of the contract length (endorsement to avoid spam).\n\n\n"

    "description": "# Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime\n## [](#non-constitutional-aip-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime-1)**\\[Non-Constitutional AIP] Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime**\n\n### [](#abstract-2)**Abstract**\n\n[WakeUp Labs](http://www.wakeuplabs.io) proposal outlines the development of a simple but effective front-end interface that enables users to force-include transactions directly on L1 when the Arbitrum Sequencer is down, aiming to increase trust among end-users navigating the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nInspired by a few community discussions ([Link 1](https://x.com/Cattin0x/status/1735779772054077917?s=20) & [Link 2](https://x.com/fede_intern/status/1754226077981893052?s=20)) , and validated historical events like: [Sequencer Downtime 1](https://offchain.medium.com/todays-arbitrum-sequencer-downtime-what-happened-6382a3066fbc), [Sequener Downtime 2](https://dedaub.com/blog/arbitrum-sequencer-outage), [Historical Sequencer Status](https://status.arbitrum.io/history/3) and [L2BEAT status](https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk).\nThis tool aims to empower users with the ability to bypass the Sequencer in situations where it is unavailable or censoring transactions, thus aligning with Arbitrum\u2019s vision for progressive decentralization.\n\nWakeUp Labs has a proven track record of expertise in crafting exceptional blockchain tools and infrastructure. Their contributions extend to collaborating on [open-source projects for major DAOs](https://x.com/0xMilton/status/1755972182553899487?s=20), enhancing Ethereum Foundation-funded initiatives, building complex DeFi protocols, SmartContracts and offering a [developer platform](http://www.platform.wakeuplabs.io) that facilitates robust and scalable API calls for smart contract deployment without requiring Solidity programming skills. (Currently operating even on the Arbitrum blockchain).\n\n### [](#introduction-3)**Introduction**\n\nThe Arbitrum Sequencer is a critical component of the network, responsible for submitting users\u2019 transactions to L1.\n\nUnder the current system, the Sequencer is a potential single point of failure; if compromised, it could delay or prevent the processing of transactions.\n\nThere are ways to bypass it, but non-developer users lack that capability.\n\nThis proposal seeks to mitigate such risks by providing a user-friendly alternative transaction submission pathway, thereby enhancing the network\u2019s resilience, user autonomy, and their confidence in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nFor the service to be truly useful in the event of catastrophic occurrences, empowering more teams to deploy their own instances is crucial. Thus, to boost the project\u2019s reliability and significantly enhance its value to the Arbitrum DAO, it is essential to embrace an OpenSource approach from the beginning.\n\n### [](#rationale-4)**Rationale**\n\n* **Decentralization and user empowerment:** By enabling direct L1 transaction submissions, users can circumvent Sequencer outages or censorship, maintaining their ability to transact without interruption. This capability is crucial for ensuring the network\u2019s operational integrity and aligns with the principle of progressive decentralization.\n* **Enhancing trustless security:** The proposed interface would serve as a valuable tool in rare situations where the Sequencer fails to perform its duties. It ensures that the Arbitrum Rollup maintains its trustless security model, even when permissioned components of the system are not functioning correctly.\n\n### [](#wakeup-labs-core-team-5)**WakeUp Labs core team**\n\n* [Milton Berman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miltonberman/), co-founder and CEO, brings extensive experience as a CTO in a decentralized identity project supported by IDB Lab and Bitcoin NGO. He has also worked as a Product Owner at Rootstock blockchain and as a CTO in a mobile game studio company. With a background in working with large corporations, Milton possesses the technical expertise and strategic vision necessary to drive the success of our project.\n* [Maximiliano del Hoyo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximiliandh/), co-founder and CBDO, has a diverse background in software and finance. His previous experience at notable companies like Microsoft and Nestle provides him with the necessary knowledge and network to navigate the intersection of technology and business, ensuring the effective achievement of the project\u2019s goals.\n* [Gonzalo Silman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-silman/), co-founder and COO, possesses a unique blend of expertise in economics (former university professor), finance, and entrepreneurial experience in creating gaming products for LATAM communities. This diverse background brings a fresh perspective and innovative thinking to our project, enabling us to understand user needs and craft tailored solutions that resonate with our target audience.\n\n### [](#proposal-details-6)**Proposal Details**\n\n### [](#technical-implementation-7)Technical Implementation\n\n1. **OpenSource from Day One**: Given that the project should be 100% trustless, as clearly outlined in its \u2018Rationale\u2019 above, we believe that the entire project, including both the Back-End and Front-End, should be OpenSource from the beginning. One of our goals is for this service to be run from different instances and by different providers; therefore, it will be a top priority to ensure that this repository is well-documented and our support is readily available so that any team or community project can implement it.\n2. **Transaction Monitoring:** Develop functionality to listen for user transactions on L2 that are not included by the Sequencer, with guidance from the Arbitrum SDK documentation.\n3. **Manual Transaction Hash Input:** In cases where automatic detection is not feasible, provide a user interface for manually entering the transaction hash or implement manually the previous transaction in the new solution.\n   * *Step 2 and 3 might not be resolved as outlined in the proposal due to Arbitrum\u2019s specific traits. However, a solution will be proposed and explained in both the technical documentation and the research document from milestone 1.*\n4. **L1 Transaction Replication:** Implement mechanisms to replicate the intended L2 transaction on L1, using \u201cForced Withdrawal\u201d type transactions to push the L2 transaction from L1.\n5. **Confirmation Display:** Ensure the interface provides feedback once the transaction has successfully been processed.\n6. **Processing Time Consideration:** Account for the approximately 24-hour processing period to prevent errors or transaction duplication across chains.\n7. **Hosting, Service & Maintenance:** WakeUp will host the service, ensuring it runs 24/7, even on IPFS. For the first three months, we will fine-tune and iterate the service. Additionally, should any problems occur, the WakeUp team is committed to identifying and resolving these issues for a minimum of the next two years.\n\n### [](#development-roadmap-budget-allocation-8)Development Roadmap & Budget Allocation:\n\n1. **Technical Research, POC, Documentation and Testing (4 weeks, $ARB 9000):**\n   Deep dive into the Delayed Inbox functionality and its integration, along with creating a PoC and validating the necessity of a new internal tool for transaction monitoring and sequencer status. We will also carefully check that our solution doesn\u2019t disrupt the proper functioning of Arbitrum; if it does, we will enable this instance only when the official sequencer is not operating correctly. This research conducted by the WakeUp Team will be made public, and the community will be able to view it, both in a summary Twitter Thread and in an Article shared on the OSS Github repository once completed.\n   This document will also consider the security measures that must be taken into account when carrying out the development.\n2. **Endpoint Development (1.5 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\n   Creation of endpoints to interact with the backend logic.\n3. **Logic Integration and Testing (2.5 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\n   Connecting the frontend to the endpoints and verifying the operational logic, and test heavily the MVP.\n4. **Design Phase (4 weeks, $ARB 5000):**\n   Additional time allocated for the design process, ensuring a user-friendly experience.\n5. **UI Development (3 weeks, $ARB 5500):**\n   Crafting an aesthetic and intuitive user interface inspired by existing high-quality designs.\n   To enhance user security, we will add a banner at the top of the website to ensure the URL is correct and guard against phishing sites.\n6. **Enhancing Documentation Clarity and Usability (3 weeks, $ARB 6000):**\n   Finalizing and clearly documenting the open-source codebase. As detailed above, any team should be able to run their own instance of the service, so it\u2019s crucial that everything is sufficiently clear. There, we will also add a list of URLs for instances set up by others that we can confirm are correctly implemented.\n   * *This process will not be linear. Since the project will be OpenSource from the beginning, it may not be sufficiently organized until milestone 6 is reached. This is why significant community contributions, like PRs or entirely new pieces of code, will be more practical after this milestone is completed.*\n7. **Service & Maintenance after Launch (24 months, $ARB 10000).**\n   We commit to hosting the site on Vercel or AWS, ensuring 24/7 operation for at least 24 months. Once a stable version has been achieved and properly tested, an instance will also be running on IPFS to ensure a 100% decentralized option. While this may not be the most performant option, it will be available for at least these 2 years. After evaluating its performance, we will attempt to provide it indefinitely. Initially, the WakeUp team will refine the website based on feedback from users and the Arbitrum community and will conduct continuous testing to ensure its reliability. Any issues, such as downtime or crashes, will be promptly addressed by the WakeUp team for at least the next two years.\n\n### [](#budget-resources-and-payment-schedule-9)**Budget, Resources and Payment Schedule**\n\n* **Estimated Timeframe:** Approximately 4.5 months for full implementation, including design phases; followed by 3 months dedicated to post-launch iterations and 24 months of hosting, monitoring, and bug fixing to address any possible error.\n* **Development Team:** One full-time senior Solidity developer for the core implementation and research, in coordination with the entire WakeUp Labs engineering team, plus additional design and developer resources for the UI/UX phase. The proposal also includes a Senior Developer working part-time for post-launch maintenance.\n  Gonzalo or Milton from the core team will also keep track of the project as PO.\n* **Payment Schedule & Terms:**\n  * A payment of 20% of the total grant required will be made on June 1st, as a *\u201cKick off payment\u201d*.\n  * The remainder of the grant will be vested gradually, on a second-by-second basis, until approximately September (Over 4 months after the kickoff).\n  * The security council / The Arbitrum Foundation reserves the right to revoke the payment stream at any moment, to be used in case of unsatisfactory performance.\n* **Total Cost:** 42.500 $ARB\n\n### [](#conclusion-10)**Conclusion**\n\n### [](#h-11)\n\nDeveloping a front-end interface to enable force-including transactions during Sequencer downtime is a crucial requirement in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal aims to empower users by ensuring transaction capabilities even when the Sequencer is unavailable. By doing so, it aligns with Arbitrum\u2019s goals of decentralization and enhancing user autonomy.\n\nFor the solution to be truly useful in critical cases, we must ensure that other projects can run their own instances of this service. This is why the project is conceived as OpenSource from the very beginning, and the WakeUp Labs team will actively assist teams wanting to implement it.\n\nFurthermore, WakeUp will be responsible for maintaining the service operational and implementing minor improvements for a minimum of 2 years.\n\n#### [](#notes-12)Notes:\n\nSome changes have been made throughout the proposal; you can see the details here: [Tally: Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/21247/46) [Proposals\n](/c/proposals/7)\n\nOpenZeppelin did a security analysis of this proposal here: <https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/security-analysis-of-using-hedgey-for-proposal-payment-vesting/23780>"

We would like to thank the entire ArbitrumDAO community for their valuable input.*\n\n# [](#p-57276-tldr-2)TL;DR\n\n* Expand the program by introducing a new and improved version, **to be implemented over the course of a year.**\n* We propose a total budget of USD 4.2 million (in a year) in delegate incentives, **with a maximum monthly compensation of 7000 USD or 16,500 ARB per month per delegate.**\n* **Creating Delegates\u2019 compensation tiers:**\n  * **Tier 3:** TP \u2265 65% and \\< 70%. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.\n  * **Tier 2:** TP \u2265 70% and \\< 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.\n  * **Tier 1:** TP \u2265 85%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.\n* **Elimination of the special multisig**, the DIP adheres to the [MSS](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4f6f6c1ba11de1122d5d5b8b098999610920fdc9c61a5e775ea09fbb4bdffc1b)\n* The DAO can cancel the program or modify parameters, such as the scoring methodology, through a Snapshot vote.\n* **Min threshold requirement change:** Participation Rate (Karma) \u2265 75% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days. Previously, the requirement was 25% of total historical votes.\n* **Soft enforcement for DAO\u2019s social agreements:** Each delegate must adhere to and comply with all social agreements reached through Snapshot in order to receive incentives.\n* Adding the possibility of **revoking DIP Ban** via Snapshot vote and also creating the **DIP Suspension.**\n* **Delegates\u2019 Feedback Update:** The DAO has [opted](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1326cb522a74b29fb12d52bb302b245180c2b8f6e1fe8f295c4447bd96a5bacd) for v1.5 of the DIP, so a new rubric will be applied to evaluate the feedback given by the delegates in the diverse discussions. Due to the experimental nature of this new scoring system, it will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to **submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.**\n* **Note that everything related to** [DIP 1.0](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98889951328992702889653461987621825257851718470562453684547824130828387112157) **that has not been mentioned as modifications in this new proposal will remain in effect in v1.5.**\n* **Scoring Weight Changes**:\n  * **Participation Rate (PR):** Previously weighted at 20% and based on historical participation rates in Tally. Now, it is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV):** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 20%.\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR)**: The weight of this parameter has decreased from 25% to 10%.\n  * **Delegates\u2019 Feedback (DF):** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 30%.\n  * **Total Participation (TP):** The requirement for total participation has increased from +60% to +65%.\n  * **Bonus points update:** Adding Bonus Points for delegates who attends to the \u201c[Arbitrum Governance Report Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/19th-grc-governance-reporting-call-on-wednesday-september-25th-at-2pm-utc/26901)\u201d (monthly) and the \u201c[Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/biweekly-proposals-discussions-call/46).\u201d\n    * For the monthly call, 2,5% BP will be awarded for attendance.\n    * For the bi-weekly calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attending each call.\n\n# [](#p-57276-abstract-3)Abstract\n\nWe propose renewing the ArbitrumDAO Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) for one year. This renewal will include adjustments to the parameters, requirements, budget, and incentives awarded to delegates.\n\n# [](#p-57276-motivation-4)Motivation\n\nWe\u2019ve reached the [fifth month of the current version](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-results-july-2024/26098) of the incentive program, which ends on August 31.\n\nAs outlined in the [mid-term report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives/25671), the program has positively impacted ArbitrumDAO during the first three months.\n\nHowever, simply renewing the program will not generate enough value. Therefore, we propose adjustments to improve the program and increase its impact on ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThese changes are based on our experience as administrators, the reports we\u2019ve conducted, and feedback from delegates, the Karma team, and key community members.\n\n**Note:** *SEEDGov delivered the end-term report, you can check it* [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives-part-2-final-report/26982)*.*\n\n# [](#p-57276-strengthening-dips-mission-vision-5)Strengthening DIP\u2019s Mission & Vision\n\nAs we mentioned in the [report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/response-to-arbitrum-staking-proposal-ardc-research-deliverable/26048), it is crucial to keep delegated voting power active within ArbitrumDAO. We believe the Incentive Program should focus on the professionalization of delegates.\n\nBy professionalization, delegates should dedicate a significant amount of time to staying informed about developments in ArbitrumDAO, gaining knowledge of Arbitrum\u2019s technology, and making meaningful contributions to the DAO. This includes active participation in most DAO activities like providing feedback on proposals, attending to Governance Calls, maintaining high voting participation on Snapshot and Tally, and providing a rationale for such votes.\n\nTo achieve this, we also need to establish transparent and predictable incentives. Delegates should be confident that if they align with the DAO and improve their contributions over time\u2014essentially if they professionalize\u2014they will receive better incentives. These incentives should be transparent and attractive without being subject to manipulation or arbitrary changes in their amount. Delegates should focus on their role and DAO activities, not on understanding complex economic mechanisms to receive compensation.\n\nWe want delegates to be motivated to participate actively in ArbitrumDAO. In order to do this, incentives must be attractive enough for them to either participate directly or hire competent individuals to represent their interests, those of their community, or their protocol.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while managing the incentive program, we realized that it doesn\u2019t address all the challenges faced by the DAO, such as vote distribution, attracting new contributors, and other aspects. Expecting a single strategy to tackle all issues overlooks the diversity of factors involved. However, we\u2019re pleased to see initiatives like [ARB Staking](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084), [(Re)delegation Week](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/what-is-re-delegation-week-application-thread/25262/26), and the [Public Good Citizen Enfranchisement Pool](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/1) are underway to address these challenges. As each initiative matures, we can align them to achieve a more significant collective impact.\n\n# [](#p-57276-general-parameters-6)General parameters\n\nThe proposed changes below are based on the experience we\u2019ve gained while managing the program, the delegates\u2019 feedback during the discussion on this thread, and both reports we made for the DIP 1.0 ([mid-term](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives/25671) report and [final](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives-part-2-final-report/26982) report).\n\n**If you want to view the parameters of the previous program, click** [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98889951328992702889653461987621825257851718470562453684547824130828387112157).\n\n## [](#p-57276-duration-7)Duration\n\nThe program\u2019s first phase lasted six months, as it was designed as an experimental foundation. For this iteration, extending the duration to twelve months is appropriate, providing greater predictability and flexibility for implementing future changes.\n\n**ArbitrumDAO may cancel the program or modify parameters, such as scoring methodology, through an instantaneous vote.**\n\n## [](#p-57276-requirements-to-participate-in-the-dip-8)Requirements to Participate in the DIP\n\nThe requirements to participate in the program are as follows:\n\n* Each delegate must adhere to all social agreements reached through Snapshot, including those outlined in proposals such as \u2018[Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO\u2019s Operations](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x249a8e8aef5dc59da18b72e7d14ace5197ec6242675ab7f82b3d3f17f71bb13b),\u2019 \u2018[Should the DAO Create COI & Self Voting Policies](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbbec2fbf891d9abb21e8be380f79806519df8294d1d2cdce155d105fd1fed8db)?,\u2019 \u2018[Incentives Detox Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x99b57df3577e8e6561f3549b057bd87fdb7e66f65a7c45fddf63d9cd62f993d8),\u2019 and any other proposals or codes of conduct that may be approved in the future.\n* **Voting Power: >50K ARB, corresponding to 176 delegates.** (Source: [Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n  * **Change:** This parameter will remain unchanged.\n  * **Motivation:** Currently, only 30% of delegates meeting this requirement are part of the program. One of our goals for this renewal is to increase the number of participating delegates.\n* **Participation Rate (Karma): \u226575% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days.**\n  * **Change:** Previously, the requirement was 25% of total historical votes.\n  * **Motivation:** As the number of proposals grows, the impact of each individual vote decreases, making it challenging to meet the historical 25% PR. This change aims to lower the barrier for new participants, ensuring that all delegates, regardless of when they joined Arbitrum, are recognized for their consistency and active participation in the DAO. In this way, the program\u2019s approach encourages the active participation of delegates, ensuring a more accurate and up-to-date representation.\n\n### [](#p-57276-onboarding-new-delegates-9)Onboarding new delegates\n\n*A new delegate, without prior participation history, can join the program starting in the third month after casting his first on-chain vote, as long as he meets the specified requirements (>50k voting power and \u226575% participation in on-chain votes) during that third month.*\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2d74f7ff92612525b1bd8a4b822d56642337323f_2_690x428.png)\n\n## [](#p-57276-incentive-program-application-10)Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates who meet the requirements must confirm their participation in the DIP via the [DIP Application Thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945). Delegates can join the program anytime within 12 months, provided they meet the specified criteria. To minimize the potential for manipulation, delegates who sign up before the third day of the month will be included in the incentive calculations for that month. **The delegates who have registered for v1.0 will not have to go through this procedure again**\n\n### [](#p-57276-regarding-delegates-kyc-11)Regarding delegates\u2019 KYC\n\nIt is important to mention that it **won\u2019t be necessary** for the delegates already registered to complete the KYC again. They will only need to sign updated agreements with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### [](#p-57276-incentive-program-application-template-12)Incentive Program Application Template\n\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Participation Rate 90 days - Karma (Link):\n\n**Note:** *Any delegate who chooses to withdraw from the program can indicate their intention to opt out by posting a message in the forum.*\n\n## [](#p-57276-number-of-delegates-to-receive-incentives-13)Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe will maintain this parameter at 50 delegates.\n\n## [](#p-57276-incentive-budget-14)Incentive Budget\n\n**Budget Allocation: MAX 4,200,000 USD (up to 7.000 USD per delegate per month).**\n\n### [](#p-57276-making-the-incentives-more-predictable-15)Making the incentives more predictable\n\nIn the initial iteration of the DIP, costs were denominated solely in ARB, which led to challenges due to the token\u2019s [volatility](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-backed-vaults-risk-analysis/26192).\n\nWhen the program launched in March, the token was valued at approximately USD 1.70, allowing a delegate with 100% Total Participation (TP) to earn around USD 8,500 per month. However, now, in the fifth month of the program, the token is valued at USD 0.55, reducing a delegate\u2019s maximum monthly compensation to about USD 2,750\u2014a decrease of over 60% for the same amount of work. This significant reduction could disincentivize delegate participation.\n\nThe same issue applies to operational, development, and maintenance costs, which have become increasingly misaligned.\n\nTo avoid this situation, we propose that payments be denominated in USD **and made in ARB tokens**. Again, the delegates\u2019 incentives should be transparent and attractive without being subject to manipulation or arbitrary changes in their amount.\n\nIf we want to professionalize DAO operations as much as possible and stay aligned we should aim for delegates to have a certain seniority and dedication to Bringing Value to Arbitrum DAO. Thus, delegates who meet the requirements at the end of the month and achieve a TP of at least 65% will be eligible to receive up to 7,000 USD in ARB tokens as compensation.\n\nNow, as program administrators, our goal is to create the necessary incentives to elevate the overall quality of contributions. During the first iteration of the DIP, we observed that the compensation for top delegates did not significantly differ from those with lower Total Participation (TP) scores. To address this, we propose the introduction of three compensation tiers based on the Total Participation Rate achieved by each delegate.\n\n* **Tier 3:** TP \u2265 65% and \\< 70%. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.\n* **Tier 2:** TP \u2265 70% and \\< 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.\n* **Tier 1:** TP \u2265 85% and \\< 100%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.\n\nThis approach makes the program more cost-effective per USD spent because as the quality of contributions increases, more resources are allocated to higher-performing delegates (those in tiers 1 and 2). Conversely, if delegate performance is suboptimal, fewer resources are allocated, with more delegates falling into tiers 2 and 3.\n\nWe considered the volatility of the ARB token by suggesting an ARB cap for each Tier. In this way, while delegates\u2019 compensation could still be affected after a drastic price drop, we would at the same time protect the DAO\u2019s interests by limiting its \u201closs\u201d somewhat. It also act as a mechanism to align delegates with Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Note:** *ARB Cap for each Tier **includes a 30% buffer**.*\n\nWe\u2019ll provide a simulation of what the payout would look like in 3 different scenarios:\n\n* **1st scenario (base): ARB at $0.55**\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d030a4c6c32c6d51fe582b410ab77e7bf38bebe0_2_602x283.png)\n\n* **2nd Scenario: ARB at $0.35**\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c7772de483ab320803d0e1074ac0ace0b2232e29_2_602x283.png)\n\n* **3rd Scenario: ARB at $1.00**\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6d5527d5473ae5488221630857e1bd793933235a_2_602x288.png)\n\n**Note:** *We will use the* [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) *rate at the time of payment to determine the value of ARB each month.*\n\nAs seen in the images, an increase in ARB\u2019s price would significantly reduce the spending in ARB, allowing the DAO to benefit from the rise. In the other hand, if the price falls to $0.35, the token expenditure of the program is limited to mitigate the DAO\u2019s potential \u201closs.\u201d This approach also better aligns the program\u2019s USD spending with the DAO\u2019s new economic and financial reality.\n\nAdditionally, the use of tiers in this manner allows for a significant boost in incentives when efforts are increased, acting as a catalyst for delegate activity. The first tier serves as a \u2018minimum payment\u2019 for delegates who, for example, fulfill their primary duties: participating in every vote and providing some input in the forum.\n\nTiers 1 and 2 represent the leap in quality, requiring greater effort to obtain 70-100% of the TP, but offering a higher reward in return. A delegate who provides a high degree of dedication and high quality input can DOUBLE the incentives of the lowest tier.\n\n**Payments to delegates are expected to be processed in ARB from the MSS between the 15th and 16th of each month.**\n\n## [](#p-57276-conflict-resolution-16)Conflict resolution\n\n### [](#p-57276-dispute-17)Dispute\n\nIf delegates disagree with the results presented by the [Karma Dashboard](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation) at the beginning of each month, they have a four-day period to contest them.\n\nTo raise a dispute, delegates must post a message in the forum using the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for Dispute (provide details)\n\nThe DIP administrator will address the issue promptly, with a resolution expected within a maximum of 4 days.\n\n### [](#p-57276-dip-ban-18)DIP Ban\n\nThe program administrator will have the right to expel a delegate if they attempt to game or exploit the program or if the delegate does not meet any of the aforementioned requirements to be considered eligible. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator. In all cases the ban is permanent.\n\nThe affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change (for suspension), or revoke the Administrator\u2019s decision. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final.\n\n### [](#p-57276-dip-suspension-19)DIP Suspension\n\nThe program administrator will have the right to suspend a delegate if he/she/they commits a fault that in the administrator\u2019s judgment is insufficient cause for expulsion. The decision and duration of the suspension are at the discretion of the program administrator (duration can\u2019t exceed the program\u2019s current iteration).\n\nThe affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change, or revoke the Administrator\u2019s decision. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final.\n\n## [](#p-57276-scoring-20)Scoring\n\nTo determine which delegates will receive monthly payments, we will continue using the [dashboard](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation) developed by Karma.\n\n**Note:** *The program manager may adjust the compensation parameters, provided they inform the DAO of the reasons for the changes.*\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3ce736d6381929e586ea2e23db6ca976722c0d83_2_690x322.png)[](#p-57276-new-evaluation-system-for-delegates-feedback-21)**New Evaluation System for Delegates\u2019 Feedback**\n\nWe\u2019ve listened to the concerns raised by some delegates regarding the changes in the Delegates\u2019 Feedback section.\n\nSo, we propose changing the way we collect feedback from a quantitative to a qualitative way.\n\nInstead of counting comments on proposals that reach Snapshot, we propose implementing a monthly analysis of the feedback provided by delegates, regardless of whether the proposal/discussion has reached Snapshot.\n\nIn this way, the Program Administrator would be responsible for creating a rubric that evaluates the value and timeliness of the feedback provided by delegates. The goal of this system is to:\n\n* Incentivize quality over quantity of feedback.\n* Extend the analysis across all contributions made by a delegate in the forum (instead of only considering those that reach Snapshot).\n* Avoid unnecessary or spam comments made solely to achieve a higher score.\n* Allow delegates to focus on contributing to proposals or discussions related to their areas of expertise.\n\nUnder this system, a delegate could achieve the same score with (for example) one big significant contribution or by making several smaller contributions. It also discourages actors who might try to take advantage of the program.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-evaluation-approach-22)**Evaluation Approach**\n\nThis rubric assesses the overall feedback provided by the delegate throughout the month (from day 1 at 00:00 UTC to the last day of the month at 23:59:59 UTC), based on a summary of their participation in various proposals and discussions. The aim is to measure the consistency, quality, and overall impact of their contributions. We expect delegates to comment on and/or provide feedback on proposals and discussions both before and during the voting process. This feedback should aim to foster debate, improve the proposal, or clarify issues not explicitly addressed within it.\n\nWe trust the goodwill of the delegates to avoid meaningless/spam comments and ensure that all contributions are sensible.\n\n* **Key point:** Feedback or opinions that violate [community rules](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidlines/12807) will not be considered. Your interactions should contribute constructively to the discussions and the deliberation and improvement of the proposals.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-rubric-specifications-23)**Rubric Specifications**\n\nThe parameter \u201cProposal Feedback\u201d should be renamed to \"Delegate\u2019s Feedback\u201d in this case since we\u2019re analyzing the overall feedback provided by the delegate (not just proposals on snapshot) and will maintain a maximum weight of 30%, the score will be awarded based on the following rubric:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8f9ffbb43536c0fd29508d9230235895d8ba9b42_2_602x471.png)\n\nHere is a breakdown of each criterion included in the rubric:\n\n* **Relevance:** Analyzes whether the delegate\u2019s feedback throughout the month is relevant to the discussion.\n* **Depth of Analysis:** It evaluates the depth of analysis provided by the delegate concerning the proposals or discussions. This serves as a metric to assess whether the delegate takes the time to thoroughly meditate on the discussion and demonstrates attention to the details. Key elements include solid arguments, relevant questions, and thorough reasoning.\n* **Timing:** Considers when the delegate provides feedback, rewarding those who provide feedback earlier, as long as they meet the above criteria. Note that feedback will be considered as provided before on-chain/off-chain voting if it was published before the day voting starts at 00:00 UTC.\n* **Clarity and Communication:** this is a review of the clarity, structured communication, and overall readability of the delegate\u2019s feedback. Clear and well-written feedback is rewarded.\n* **Impact on Decision-Making:** While the proposer ultimately decides whether to incorporate feedback, high-quality feedback from a delegate often influences the final proposal that goes to vote. This criterion evaluates whether the delegate\u2019s feedback tends to drive changes in proposals/discussions.\n* **Presence in Discussions:** This is a more quantitative analysis, intended to reflect the effort of delegates who participate in most discussions. This parameter serves as a multiplier to the score obtained across the previous five criteria. Note that the percentage of participation in monthly discussions could be not linear across all DAO\u2019s discussions. Some proposals may carry more weight in the overall discussions (special cases such as LTIPP/STIP, gaming, treasury, etc.).\n\n#### [](#p-57276-monthly-evaluation-process-24)**Monthly Evaluation Process**\n\n**1. Data Collection**: At the end of the month, the complete set of contributions by each delegate across all discussions on the forum is reviewed.\n\n**2. Overall Evaluation:** The rubric is used to assess the delegate\u2019s overall performance on each criterion, based on a holistic view of their participation.\n\n**3. Score Assignment:** A level of 1 to 4 is assigned to each criterion, based on the consistency and quality of the delegate\u2019s contributions over the month. Each level has an assigned score, from 1 to 4.\n\n**4. Monthly Report:** A qualitative and quantitative report summarizing the delegate\u2019s performance over the month is then produced.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-scoring-methodology-25)**Scoring Methodology**\n\nEach rubric criterion has levels with an assigned score, from 1 to 4, depending on the level achieved.\n\nThe initial score is obtained by adding the first five criteria, while the final score results from applying the \u201cPresence in Discussions\u201d multiplier to the initial average score. The maximum Initial Score is 20 points and 30 points for the Final Score.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, here\u2019s an example:\n\n* Relevance: Level 3 - Scoring achieved = 3\n* Depth of Analysis: Level 2 - Scoring achieved = 2\n* Timing: Level 4 - Scoring achieved = 4\n* Clarity and Communication: Level 2 - Scoring achieved = 2\n* Impact on Decision-Making: Level 3 - Scoring achieved = 3\n\n**Initial Score/Average: 70% or 14/20 or 2.8/4**\n\n* Participation in Discussions: Level 2 - Multiplier assigned: 1.10x\n\n**Final Score: 70% x 1.1 = 77% or 23.1/30 Delegates\u2019 Feedback points.**\n\n#### [](#p-57276-trade-offs-26)**Trade-offs**\n\nWe are aware that this proposed solution introduces trust assumptions regarding the Program Administrator\u2019s criteria for evaluating feedback. We view this layer of subjectivity as inevitable until we can implement automated tools, such as the AI that Karma is developing, to assess the quality of delegate feedback. It is important to note that, as Program Administrators, after analyzing proposals and feedback for the last six months, we have gained experience that (we believe) will help us correctly identify constructive feedback.\n\nAt SEEDGov, we are committed to being as transparent as possible, as we have been thus far. Therefore, the rubric and the monthly report will always be publicly accessible to all interested parties. During this phase, feedback from Arbitrum DAO will also be crucial in helping us refine our evaluation criteria.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-next-steps-regarding-feedback-27)**Next steps regarding Feedback**\n\nDuring the first iteration of this delegate program, we have been closely monitoring forum activity, particularly during the feedback stage of various proposals. As this phase was a trial, we primarily focused on observing certain dynamics within the forum to better understand them and make adjustments for the next iteration.\n\nOne of the issues we identified is the use of AI to comment on proposals. While the use of AI for tasks such as translating text or correcting grammatical errors is understandable, we have seen instances where it has been employed to generate feedback based on other users\u2019 comments. This has not been a widespread or alarming issue but, in the next iteration, we plan to take a more reactive approach.\n\nAnother issue we have encountered is regarding users who post \u201cReserved for later comment.\u201d We want to clarify that we do not recommend or encourage such practices, which should preferably be avoided.\n\nIn this iteration, we will try to provide feedback to delegates on this type of situation.\n\n### [](#p-57276-experimental-nature-of-the-new-delegates-feedback-scoring-system-28)Experimental nature of the new delegates\u2019 feedback scoring system.\n\nDue to the experimental nature of this new scoring system, it will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to **submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.**\n\n### [](#p-57276-scoring-weight-changes-29)Scoring Weight Changes\n\nAfter observing delegate behavior and some internal discussions, we believe it is necessary to adjust specific parameters of the program:\n\n**Participation Rate (PR)**\n\n* **Change**: Previously weighted at 20% and based on historical participation rates in Tally. Now, it is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).\n* **Motivation:** The 90-day participation rate is a requirement for delegates to register in the program. Unlike the historical rate, this parameter is more accessible, so we have decided to lower its weight.\n\n**Snapshot Voting (SV)**\n\n* **Change:** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 20%.\n* **Motivation:** Snapshot voting is a crucial part of the governance process. It is essential to give it more weight to encourage delegates to vote in snapshots.\n\n**Communicating Rationale (CR)**\n\n* **Change:** The weight of this parameter has decreased from 25% to 10%.\n* **Motivation:** While providing a rationale for votes is important, we consider the feedback period even more crucial. Therefore, we have reduced the weight of Communicating Rationale and increased the weight of Delegates\u2019 Feedback.\n\n**Delegates\u2019 Feedback (DF)**\n\n* **Change:** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 30%.\n* **Motivation:** Providing feedback on forum proposals is fundamental. We have raised this parameter\u2019s weight above others and introduced a rubric to evaluate the feedback qualitatively. These changes are detailed further above.\n\n**Total Participation (TP)**\n\n* **Change:** The requirement for total participation has increased from +60% to +65%.\n* **Motivation:** After analyzing the program\u2019s results, we observed that some delegates with high historical participation in Tally could meet the +60% requirement by voting on 100% of monthly proposals. We have decided to raise the TP requirement to +65% for compensation to encourage more contributions in the forum.\n\n**Bonus Point (BP)**\n\n* **Change:** Adding Bonus Points for delegates who attend the \u201c[Arbitrum Governance Report Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/19th-grc-governance-reporting-call-on-wednesday-september-25th-at-2pm-utc/26901)\u201d (monthly) and the \u201c[Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/biweekly-proposals-discussions-call/46).\u201d\n  * For the monthly call, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attendance.\n  * For the bi-weekly calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attending each call.\n* **Motivation**: We have received several questions about delegate participation in calls or working groups. While there is a trend to compensate work within specific WGs (and we want to avoid potential double spending by the DAO), we find it interesting to experiment with the idea of awarding Bonus Points to delegates who participate in both the \u201c[Arbitrum Governance Report Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/19th-grc-governance-reporting-call-on-wednesday-september-25th-at-2pm-utc/26901)\u201d (monthly) and the \u201c[Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/biweekly-proposals-discussions-call/46)\u201d. We will continue to manage this parameter as in the previous program. Although it was a topic of discussion, we have yet to receive complaints about how these points were awarded. We welcome any feedback from the DAO.\n\n### [](#p-57276-details-terminology-symbols-and-formulas-30)Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n* **Participation Rate - 90 days (PR90) - Weight 15:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes in the last 90 days.

Delegates\u2019 compensations are capped at 16,500 ARB per delegate per month (Tier 1), which means the maximum spending on incentives would be 9,900,000 ARB per year (16,500 ARB x 50 delegates x 12 months). This amount represents 0.31% of the DAO\u2019s treasury.

Based on this experience, we anticipate the following work for the upcoming year:\n\n1. **Infrastructure Maintenance and Expenses:** We will continue to ensure that the dashboard operates smoothly, with real-time data updates for most metrics and daily overall calculations. This includes regular software maintenance, such as updating libraries and other necessary tasks to keep the system secure and efficient.\n2. **Ongoing Collaboration with SEEDGov:** Regular calls with the SEEDGov team over the past six months have been instrumental in maintaining the program\u2019s smooth operation. These meetings have allowed us to address bugs, resolve data discrepancies, and implement enhancements based on administrative needs. We will continue these calls to ensure ongoing improvements in operational efficiency.\n3. **Compensation Calculation Logic Updates:** As outlined in the new proposal, we will implement necessary changes to the compensation calculation logic. This includes introducing a tier system, adjusting weights and metrics, and incorporating a 90-day calculation period.\n4. **Automation of Voting Statistics:** Our current system fully automates voting statistics, streamlining the process for admins to determine compensation. Collecting data on Communication Rationale and Proposal Feedback has historically been time-consuming. A few months ago, we introduced an MVP that automates this process using LLM tools. We plan to continue enhancing this feature to further assist administrators.\n5. **Verification of Statistics:** All statistics need to be verified for accuracy in a timely manner, specifically by the first of each month. We will continue to ensure that this verification process is completed on schedule to maintain the reliability of the data.\n\n### [](#p-57276-program-manager-seedgov-40)Program Manager (SEEDGov)\n\n#### [](#p-57276-responsibilities-41)**Responsibilities**\n\nIn the first iteration of the DIP, we encountered additional tasks that were not anticipated when drafting the proposal, which required extra effort to meet the program\u2019s requirements. Therefore, in this new version, we have updated the responsibilities of the program administrator:\n\n1. Check corresponding data to see [delegates\u2019 eligibility](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945/96).\n2. Collaborate with Arbitrum Foundation to ensure delegates complete the KYC/KYB process and perform the necessary follow-up.\n3. Constantly monitor delegates\u2019 activity.\n4. Support delegates with any [questions or concerns](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-questions-and-feedback/20946/64) related to the incentive program through Telegram, forum, or Discord.\n5. Collect feedback from delegates and the community to improve the program.\n6. Review delegate comments in the forum and filter out spam messages.\n7. Communicate any [changes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegates-incentive-program-announcements-updates/23121/10) in the incentive program to the delegates\n8. Publish monthly [results](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-results-july-2024/26098/8) in the forum.\n9. Publish monthly [program costs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-payment-distribution-thread/23368/14) in the forum.\n10. Solve disputes\n11. Determine which delegates receive Bonus Points.\n12. Collaborate with MSS to ensure payments to delegates are processed each month.\n13. Periodic review of the information uploaded to the Karma dashboard.\n14. Have weekly meetings with Karma to fix bugs and enhance the dashboard.\n15. Prepare periodic reports.\n16. Prepare a rubric and a monthly report about each delegate\u2019s feedback performance.\n17. Monitor the participation of the delegates in the governance calls mentioned for the bonus points.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-deliverables-42)**Deliverables**\n\nWe commit to delivering:\n\n* Monthly results of the DIP.\n* Public cost reports to allow for audits by any interested party.\n* Mid-term and final evaluation reports of the program.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-additionals-43)**Additionals**\n\n* Hold meetings with delegates to gather feedback on the program and provide them with updates.\n* Constantly work on improvements to the program.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-what-else-can-we-do-44)**What else can we do?**\n\nWe are committed to reaching out to each of the delegates who meet the requirements to be part of the program but are not yet enrolled. Our goal is to encourage everyone to join, helping to maintain and increase the diversity of voices in Arbitrum DAO.\n\n## [](#p-57276-kpis-45)KPIs\n\nIn this new iteration of the DIP, we aim to establish the following KPIs:\n\n* Achieve that 50 delegates receive incentives.\n* Engage 100 delegates in the program.\n* Achieve an average Total Participation (TP) of 80% among participants in the program within six months.\n* Introduce improvements to the program after six months.\n\n## [](#p-57276-continuous-upgrades-46)Continuous Upgrades\n\nWe know that this program still has room for improvement. While this new program version moves away from its experimental nature to become a more developed one, a delegate incentive program must continuously receive feedback from its participants.\n\nThe SEEDGov team and Karma are committed to gathering feedback, obtaining more information, and implementing the necessary changes to optimize performance. Considering the new duration of the program, the Program Administrator reserves the right to make changes in the scoring methodology by giving public notice in the forum.\n\n**Note that everything related to** [DIP 1.0](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98889951328992702889653461987621825257851718470562453684547824130828387112157) **that has not been mentioned as modifications in this new proposal will remain in effect in v1.5.**\n\n## [](#p-57276-timeline-47)"

    "description": "# Fund the Stylus Sprint\n**TLDR of changes made since Snapshot:**\n\n* **Additional Evaluation Committee Members:**\u00a0SEEDGov and JoJo have agreed to join the evaluation committee.\n* **Soft Request \u201cCap\u201d:**\u00a0Language was added to specify a soft request \u201ccap\u201d of 500k ARB (10% of the program budget), which is dependent on the total ARB requested in the program. Applicants requesting greater than 500k ARB may be sent to the DAO directly.\n* **MSS-controlled multi-sig:**\u00a0Additional clarification has been added that funds will be managed by a MSS controlled multi-sig along with Entropy Advisors acting in an \u201capprover\u201d role to process payments to winning applicants once KYC has been completed.\n* **Flexibility in Milestone Structure:**\u00a0Language has been revised to allow applicants to propose their own milestone structure.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe\u00a0[ArbOS 31 \u201cBianca\u201d](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616)\u00a0onchain vote on Tally has passed and executed, activating Arbitrum Stylus on Arbitrum One and Nova. To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time \u201cStylus Sprint\u201d program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks with a 2 week review period and program length of 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign\u2019s primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.\n\nInterested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.\n\n## Motivation\n\nToday, the Stylus ecosystem is promising but very nascent. At launch, the developer experience will be in its early stages, offering an opportunity for pioneers to shape and refine Stylus as they build with it. Teams building with Stylus today are early adopters of the technology and are pushing the limits of what is possible on the EVM.\n\nThe \u201cStylus Sprint\u201d is strategically designed to accelerate the adoption of Stylus and help drive visibility into Stylus\u2019 transformative potential to the broader crypto community. Launched in conjunction with Bianca passing, this program aims to strengthen the momentum of the upgrade, drawing significant adoption and attention to the technological advancements it introduces.\n\n[Stylus](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts/22970)\u00a0represents a pivotal innovation for the entire Ethereum ecosystem, setting Arbitrum apart from other platforms by enabling the use of multiple programming languages for smart contracts. This not only enhances the efficiency and capabilities of Arbitrum applications but also broadens the accessibility of Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem to a more diverse group of developers. By supporting smart contracts written in languages such as Rust, C, and C++, Stylus expands the scope of possible applications, unlocking untapped use cases for end users and making Arbitrum a more versatile and attractive platform for developers. This capability represents a tangible competitive advantage for Arbitrum, and it is crucial that this differentiator is prominently showcased via its use in high-value developments.\n\nThe \u201cStylus Sprint\u201d will provide financial incentives to encourage the development of high-quality projects. This support aims to attract top-tier developers from within the Arbitrum, EVM, and Rust communities, targeting teams new to Arbitrum that can only realize their ideas with Stylus, existing Arbitrum projects with complex computation for migration, and developers from other WASM ecosystems (e.g., Solana Rust Devs), fostering a diverse range of applications. By demonstrating the practical benefits and performance enhancements Stylus offers, the program seeks to establish a robust portfolio of Stylus-based contracts, helping solidify Arbitrum\u2019s position as a leader in the rollup race. The Sprint will also empower developers to create building blocks for a wide variety of projects building on Arbitrum such as reference contracts, Rust libraries, testing/development frameworks, and SDK contributions. Reference tooling and code are crucial to any development-based ecosystem\u2019s staying power.\n\nThe Stylus Sprint aims to create a ripple effect of innovation and adoption, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and capable Arbitrum ecosystem for developers, users, and token holders.\n\n## Rationale and Goals\n\n1. Demonstrate the efficiency of, and untapped possibilities with, Stylus by showing how teams can build never-before-built protocols on Arbitrum and take advantage of Stylus\u2019 efficiency and compute advantages.\n2. Support network growth and accelerate the distribution of capital to both EVM and non-EVM protocols that migrate to Stylus to further drive network and ecosystem growth. This includes infrastructure as well as applications.\n3. Attract top protocols from other ecosystems drawn by Stylus\u2019 efficiency gains and multi-language support, which in turn will bring their user bases, increasing overall activity and transaction volume on the network.\n4. Implement a strategy to distribute grants over extended periods and in alignment with the achievement of key milestones. This approach aims to cultivate enduring relationships with protocols and ensure sustained development and engagement.\n5. Position Arbitrum as the most accessible, efficient, and powerful EVM-compatible ecosystem to build in.\n6. Provide ample resources, support, and incentives to developers utilizing Stylus, fostering robust projects and vibrant communities. This will drive the long-term growth and success of Arbitrum.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Application Process & RFP Details:\n\nAs mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nFor the open-application track, non-exhaustive categories may include:\n\n* New developer-focused infrastructure or extensions of existing developer-focused infrastructure to improve the arsenal of tools available to Stylus builders;\n* New applications that feature untapped use cases only made possible via Stylus, on Arbitrum One or new app chains using Stylus on Orbit chains;\n* External WebAssembly (WASM) application or chain migrations (from ecosystems that use Rust for their smart contracts);\n* Existing EVM application migrations from Solidity to Rust (e.g., an app rewriting a portion of their code using Stylus).\n\nFor the RFP track, the committee is excited to hear proposals from teams working on developing:\n\n* Tooling to add support for new languages with Stylus to expand the reach and adoption of Stylus among developers. This can include new SDKs, EVM-tooling specific to the new language, and/or reference implementations and libraries for the new language. To get inspired for what languages might be interesting to see support get added for:\n* [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/introduction.html)\u00a0- a Typescript-based programming language optimized for, and statically compiled down to, WASM. Typescript is a widely used programming language, with 38.5% of all developers claiming to have used or currently use Typescript, compared to 12.6% for Rust\u00a0[according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/).\n* [Move\u00a0](https://move-language.github.io/move/)- a resource-oriented, strongly typed programming language that offers built-in support for formal verification of code correctness. Originally developed by Meta for their Libra/Diem stablecoin, this language has gained popularity among emergent L1s like Flow, Aptos, and Sui. Adding Move support to Stylus and by extension the EVM opens the opportunity for Move-based applications to tap into the already-massive Arbitrum ecosystem and the liquidity layer of Ethereum.\n* A GUI for developers to inspect and interact with the\u00a0[Stylus cache manager](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-cache-manager)\u00a0on Arbitrum One. Extra consideration will be given to teams who make such a service/instance self-hostable to unlock widespread adoption and use among Stylus Orbit chains. Example user journeys that can be covered are:\n  * How a developer inspects the contents of the cache;\n  * How a developer gets the minimum bid price before bidding;\n  * How a developer makes a bid for their contract to join the cache;\n  * How a developer views the position of their contract within the cache, and/or;\n  * How a developer can subscribe to events or changes to the cache as it pertains to their contract(s).\n* A Solidity-to-WASM compiler to reduce the migration cost (for existing applications) of moving over to WASM. This in turn aims to help current Solidity projects reap the benefits of a more secure and performant WASM VM sooner and with less upfront work.\n* General improvements to the current debugging workflow and developer experience for Stylus applications and Orbit chain developers. This can include compatibility enhancements and Stylus-specific improvements to how GDB is currently used to debug Stylus applications, or the introduction/integration of new tooling to elevate the UX of Stylus contract debugging.\n* General enhancements and/or extensions to the existing Stylus Rust SDK, the cargo-stylus command line tool, and/or the WASM VM within Arbitrum Nitro itself.\n* Stylus-specific education and developer relations materials to onboard the next generation of Web3 developers.\n* Tools and frameworks to demonstratively help\u00a0[CosmWASM](https://cosmwasm.com/)\u00a0and Solana projects (as examples) to migrate to Arbitrum chains.\n\nThe application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.\n\nTeams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.\n\n### Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors\n\nTo effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far.\u00a0[@SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov)\u00a0and\u00a0[@JoJo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo)\u00a0bring extensive experience in DAO grant programs and will help round out the committee with additional perspective/backgrounds.\n\n**Evaluation Committee**\n\n1. Stylus Team Members - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n2. Dev Team - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n3. Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n4. Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n5. SEEDGov Org (5000 ARB per month)\n6. JoJo (5000 ARB per month)\n7. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe committee will work collaboratively to provide feedback and access applications. In the event of a equally split opinion, the Arbitrum Foundation will serve as the tie-breaking opinion.\n\n**Committee Advisors**\n\n1. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe Committee Advisors\u2019 main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible.\u00a0**Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.**\n\nJudges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months, with the Stylus Sprint expected to begin in November 2024 and conclude mid-January 2026. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 8 weeks will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects.\u00a0**Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.**\u00a0In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program. These updates will be posted to a dedicated Stylus Sprint forum channel.\n\n### Recommended Application Structure and Framing\n\nApplications for the program will be rigorously evaluated based on a set of clearly defined criteria. To ensure a thorough assessment, grantees are encouraged to provide detailed information about their plans and objectives for the grant. Each application should include:\n\n* What their plans are to grow their protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem;\n* How closely the team\u2019s mission aligns with those of Arbitrum;\n* Whether or not they clearly demonstrate how they will utilize Stylus;\n* An appropriate spending plan for how the grant will be used;\n* A reasonable development plan and timeline.\n\nJudges and advisors may also consider other relevant metrics tailored to the specifics of each application. These could include innovation potential, the experience of the team, market readiness, user engagement strategies, or any other factors deemed relevant.\n\nThe recommendations above are designed to ensure that the selected projects are coming to the committee with a high-quality plan and to ensure that the application ideas are not only viable, but also poised to make significant contributions to the Arbitrum ecosystem. By adhering to this application structure, the evaluation process aims to foster transparency, fairness, and alignment with the strategic objectives of the Arbitrum network. The judges and advisors will work together to create the application and evaluation criteria.\n\nQuestbook will be utilized for hosting the Stylus Sprint, accepting/rejecting applications, and giving public reasoning for the choice.\n\n### Application Evaluation Criteria\n\nWhile we strongly believe each application will be unique and should therefore be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, a baseline framework and evaluation criteria are outlined below to give teams a feel for what to keep in mind when applying and building.\n\nOverall, the Evaluation Committee will be on the lookout for, and prioritize evaluating applications, that:\n\n* **Can scale, or help scale**, Stylus usage over the long run. Examples include tooling and frameworks that can be extended, built upon, and leveraged by many teams all at once.\n* **Contribute to the young, but growing, ecosystem of Stylus tooling and infrastructure**, rather than direct contributions to individual Stylus applications and Stylus Orbit chains.\n* **Focus on projects that aim to be self-sustainable in the medium to long term**, rather than one-off projects that can only exist/survive for the short duration of the program.\n* **Directly highlight core Stylus benefits and strengths with excellent creativity**, including the efficient use of computational and storage resources or security primitives that Stylus bolsters and shines at.\n* **Fill a specific, unique niche in the market**, as opposed to re-implementing an existing application, tool, or chain in Stylus for the sake of using Stylus (and not the other purported benefits one gets with Stylus).\n* **Come from outside the Arbitrum and/or Ethereum ecosystem**\u00a0to effectively \u201cgrow the pie\u201d of Web3 projects and users.\n\nNote that applications may be rejected for a variety of reasons as there are a limited number of resources to allocate to a near-infinite pool of great ideas/applicants that can emerge. Out of scope are projects that are already being funded by the ArbitrumDAO, Offchain Labs, or the Arbitrum Foundation, or are otherwise nearing completion by the time this program\u2019s evaluation period ends. Examples of this include the development of the Stylus Rust SDK that is already being scoped out and developed by Offchain Labs.\n\n### Multisig Setup\n\nThe Stylus Sprint specific MSS multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program, 300K ARB for payments to judges, and 30k ARB for payment to Questbook. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig.\n\nEntropy Advisors will function in the \u201capprover\u201d role working with the MSS and the Arbitrum Foundation to process payments to winning applicants once KYC has been completed.\n\n### Funding Levels and Disbursement\n\nTeams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones. There is no maximum request amount, but requests over 500k that are deemed quality, have a likelihood of being sent to the DAO instead of included in the program depending on the total ARB requested in the program and quality of the applications. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nUnallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don\u2019t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.\n\nFunding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. The number of checkpoints, percentage of funds unlocked, and criteria for each will be proposed by the applicant. This is to grant additional flexibility as a one size fits all milestone structure is not the best approach given the wide-range of potential applicants and the volatile nature of ARB requests. While the milestone structure is flexible, the evaluation committee will prioritize applicants that backload payment distribution over those that request high percentages upfront.\n\nThe below milestone structure is recommended; however, it is not required:\n\n1. **10% - Planning**\u00a0+ Building: Creation of a Development Plan, Architecture Design, Prototyping, Implementation, Optimization.\n2. **40% - Deployment**: Testing, Auditing, Deployment. \\*Projects will be eligible but not guaranteed admission into the subsidy program per the ADPC\n3. **25% - Checkpoint 1**\n4. **25% - Checkpoint 2**\n\nAll projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above.\n\nThe evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.\n\n## Grant Eligibility Requirements\n\n* Grantees must participate in a case study that highlights their Stylus development experience\n* Grantees must build their projects open source, but not necessarily free to use. Free to use however will be a factor in the evaluation committee criteria.\n* Grantees must participate in co-marketing activities to promote their protocol and Stylus.\n* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant\u2019s objective.\n* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to judge progress.\n* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n* Grantees must not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n* Grantees must apply using the approved program application template.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Stylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024\n2. Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024\n3. On-Chain Vote - Oct 10th, 2024\n4. Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 28, 2024\n5. Open Application Period Begins - Nov 11th, 2024\n6. Open Application Period Ends - Jan 6th, 2025\n7. Application Review Period Ends - Jan 20th, 2025\n   a. 1 year timeline for selected applicants begins\n   b. KYC/Compliance process with the Arbitrum Foundation begins\n\nThe program will begin on the Monday following the onchain proposal\u2019s passing. The first 2 weeks will be used to refine and post the RFPs, followed by open applications for 8 weeks, then a 2-week application review process. Feedback between the Evaluation Committee and applicants will be conducted on an ongoing/continuous basis till the end of the Review Period (Jan 20th). Applicants will receive feedback on a first come, first serve basis. Those that apply early will likely have an edge over late applicants who will have less opportunities for feedback. KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation will begin after the review period and first milestone payments may be allocated upon completion. The MSS chairs, Arbitrum Foundation, and Entropy Advisors will work closely to ensure a strict payment process.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n**5,330,000 ARB**\n\n* Up to 5M to be awarded to projects building on Stylus.\n* 75,000 ARB payment in total over 14.5 months per committee member for 4 committee members = 300,000 ARB. Committee members will be paid in monthly increments of 5000 ARB.\n* 30,000 ARB paid up front to Questbook."

    "description": "# Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025\n## Abstract\n\nTo ensure Arbitrum\u2019s continued presence at the industry\u2019s most prominent events, and to enable the DAO to host in-person initiatives to accelerate collaboration and increase efficiency of operations, we (Entropy Advisors, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe) would like to earmark a budget for events for 2025 and take lead on running ongoing RFPs to satisfy the DAOs event demands. The 3 members of this group will lean on OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that any events organized by the DAO are aligned with the broader ecosystem of contributors, work towards a unified message/brand, and are synergistic with events led by the Foundation and OCL.\n\nOur proposed Events strategy should focus on 2 key categories:\n\n1. Delegate Gatherings aimed at streamlining operations through in-person meetups such as a delegate retreat.\n2. Ecosystem Growth Events to foster innovation and community engagement, ideally coinciding with other major crypto conferences (specifically ETHDenver, Bitcoin 2025: Las Vegas, EthCC, among other potential events) at the same location. These events can include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Virtual hackathons\n* Non-crypto conference presence (RustConf, CES, etc.)\n* In-person hackathons\n* Side events\n* Sponsorships of major events\n* Arbitrum Days around the world (not just EthCC)\n* Educational workshops (Stylus & Orbit)\n\nThe selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC and Disruption Joe, we will gauge community sentiment/attendance levels regarding certain events. If there is consensus to put on a certain event but there is no PM/event coordinator to lead the effort, the group will procure, select, and support service providers to make the vision a reality. It is highly likely the OCL or the Arbitrum Foundation will lead many of these events, which is made apparent by the preliminary schedule proposed below. Alternatively, if an events provider comes to the DAO with a proposal for an event that passes a Snapshot vote that garners at least 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority For/Abstain, the funds for that proposal will come from the 2025 events budget brought forth in this proposal.\n\nWe propose the earmarking of $1.5M USD to fund this initiative, with any unused funds at the end of 2025 to be returned to the DAO treasury. 4M ARB will be sent to a Foundation-controlled address to be liquidated into stablecoins, with any excess ARB immediately returned to the DAO treasury and the stablecoins to an MSS-controlled address. The ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe will be waiving payment to get this stood up, but we expect this initiative to fall under the OpCo once it becomes fully operational. We also envision a dedicated employee to lead the DAO\u2019s event strategy within the OpCo, so this is more of an effort to get the ball rolling so we are properly prepared for 2025. We plan to have the OpCo established in mid 2025, and once an events coordinator is employed by this entity, the funds will be transferred to the OpCo while Entropy, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe will be relieved of their duties thereafter.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEvents play a crucial role in strengthening the Arbitrum community and brand, attracting more users and developers to the ecosystem, expediting DAO initiatives by facilitating in-person collaboration, and providing avenues for alliance with other partners within the industry. While the Questbook program has done an excellent job in ensuring the Arbitrum brand is represented at smaller conferences across multiple regions, the DAO does not currently have a dedicated plan or budget for events. Larger Arbitrum events, such as Arbitrum Day, are left to the Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs to organize. The DAO certainly appreciates what the Foundation and OCL do on the events front, but the DAO should serve a complementary role \u2013 which if enabled \u2013 will maximize Arbitrum\u2019s overall ability to grow a healthy ecosystem and capture network effects in our speed and flexibility for deployment.\n\nThere is significant value in aligning on the scope/timing of hackathons, GovHack-type events, and major events presence (such as EthCC, DevCon, etc). For example, Stylus represents one of the most significant software upgrades in Arbitrum\u2019s history \u2013 it could be wise for the DAO to ensure a Stylus-focused hackathon is planned for 2025 in an effort to bring more developers into our ecosystem and to improve dev tooling/infra. In addition to ecosystem events, it is very important for delegates to meet up in person at a regular cadence. We see how much more we can accomplish in-person time and time again, and we believe the DAO could formulate and execute on a grander strategy if these delegate offsites were formally planned/coordinated.\n\nHosting events requires substantial upfront time and capital, typically involving 4-6 months of planning and $25-100k in down payments for venues, travel, accommodations, catering, and other expenses. Planning and funding events on a case-by-case basis are impractical due to the lead time and the lengthy DAO voting process. Recently, the DAO\u00a0[approved](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22498645709460639498013508413205734891453964526622655693207250687057651118730)\u00a0$309k to host an event at EthCC in Brussels. However, the proposal was not executed on-chain until approximately five weeks before the event. Hack Humanity, the entity behind the GovHack event, took on substantial risk by using its funds to secure a venue, caterers, and other necessities without a guarantee of DAO funding. Although Hack Humanity felt comfortable taking this risk due to previous collaboration with the DAO and assistance from Entropy Advisors, this upfront financial burden should not fall on service providers in the future. One off RFP processes would enable organizers to plan higher-quality events with the extra time & budget provided. Alternatively, any service provider can gauge DAO sentiment directly via snapshot, which will drastically reduce the burden of the Arbitrum DAO governance process put on service providers.\n\nTo ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the ability to represent itself at various events and to create new in-person experiences, we propose earmarking funds so this can be achieved in a streamlined manner. While we propose 3 core events in the section below, any DAO member can make a proposal to utilize these earmarked funds at any time. We are also happy to alter the below calendar in accordance with feedback received on the forum.\n\n## Proposed Industry Events for 2025, Q1\\&Q2\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"221\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0e4effcf28aaa53e548d8dcbda00b9edcdb8a920_2_624x221.png\" />1600\u00d7566 16.4 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0e4effcf28aaa53e548d8dcbda00b9edcdb8a920.png)\n\n\n\nThe above events were chosen based on the need to bolster Arbitrum\u2019s presence at the industry\u2019s top events. As mentioned above, the Questbook program has done an excellent job at making sure Arbitrum has a presence at smaller events across the globe. To date (September 10th, 2024) the events track has funded event initiatives in the following regions: Latam (8), Africa (6), India (4), APAC (4), and Europe (2).\n\nThere are also ample opportunities to fund events in the back half of 2025 that align with Arbitrum\u2019s strategic objectives (Ex. RustConf, GamesCon, Solana Breakpoint). However, with the expectation that a more comprehensive events strategy will be rolled up into OpCo upon the hiring of a full time events coordinator, we felt it was better suited to only establish a rough strategy for the first half of 2025 while leaving the door open for other service providers and community members to bring forth their own ideas.\n\n### ETHDenver - February\n\nETHDenver is an Ethereum centric conference that has one of the largest attendee lists of any event throughout 2025. Arbitrum has historically had a presence here, but we would like to partner with OCL to bolster the DAO\u2019s representation. We envision a very large floor space at ETHDenver (see photo below of Near\u2019s booth at ETHDenver in 2024 for inspiration), with plenty of room for Arbitrum projects to showcase their products, delegates and other DAO contributors to talk to people who are interested in getting involved, and an area for more technical folks to ask OCL questions about the Arbitrum roadmap and tech upgrades. Last year, Arbitrum had a smaller 10x20 or 20x20 floor space at ETHDenver, but this year we want to go bigger. OCL will lead the charge on this front, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can assist as needed and funnel ideas from the community to their team.\n\n<img height=\"407\" width=\"624\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-22 at 1.15.50 PM\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/11b5cb68df2614f42437162176baa40b075f70d1.jpeg\" />\n\n### Bitcoin 2025: Las Vegas - May\n\nThe Bitcoin conference is the most widely attended conference in all of crypto, and is ofcourse a Bitcoin-focused event. However, as seen with the rise of \u201cBTC L2s\u201d, Ordinals/Runes/other inscriptions, etc, there is a growing appetite from developers, users, and VCs to build out more functionality on Bitcoin. Additionally, there is work being done to enable OP\\_CAT, which could enable trust minimized bridging of BTC to other chains. As such, we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence here. There is no reason Orbit should not have a presence on Bitcoin, and the DAO recently signaled its support for Orbit deployments on alternative settlement layers via\u00a0[snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd6138aaca39742a1a56f3219a74a4258e0786aa5494cdfbe752f23277c1b947f)\u00a0vote. Bitcoin has served as the \u201cGateway\u201d for bringing new people onchain in the past, and we believe targeting Bitcoin supporters is a good way to onboard new users into the Arbitrum ecosystem. We would like to work with OCL on this event, similar to the ETHDenver event, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can procure a service provider and act as the point of contact in case OCL does not have interest in partnering with the DAO on this event.\n\n### EthCC - July\n\nEthCC, similar to ETHDenver, is one of the largest Ethereum-centric events of the year, and has historically been hosted in the EU. The event in 2025 is currently slated to take place in Cannes, France, but with the recent arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France, this could potentially change. Nevertheless, this is an event that we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence at, and we again suggest supporting OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to put this event together. In the scenario that OCL/the Foundation does not want to work with the DAO on this initiative, the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy will procure a 3rd party organizer to manage this event and will be in attendance to ensure things go smoothly. We are hopeful that OpCo will be stood up by this time, so there is a strong possibility that this event will fall under its purview rather than the aforementioned individuals/entities.\n\n### Other Events:\n\nWe estimate the three events outlined above to cost somewhere in the range of $250-$400k, and would thus have a budget approved that is much higher than the actual outlays. We want to avoid scenarios where we are forced to overpay for event service providers, have a limited selection of service providers, or need to rush through the DAO process in order to meet deadlines for future events. Therefore, we are requesting a budget much larger than required so that if other community members wish to push forward an event, they can do so without having to go through the full governance process.\n\nInstead, we suggest that anyone can put forth an idea for an event in the first half of 2025, but that it can pull from these pre-approved funds via a snapshot vote that must garner 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain. From there, the ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe can help procure service providers to put on the event, or the proposer themselves can serve as the project manager/event coordinator. This will cut down on the lead time to put on other events and give the DAO more negotiation power when organizing events on an expedited timeline. Some other events that we had envisioned include presence at non-crypto conferences such as RustConf or CES to attract new developers and users, virtual hackathons specifically focused on Stylus or Orbit with the help of a service provider like\u00a0[Buidlbox](https://buidlbox.io/),\u00a0[ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/), etc. It is also important to note, that events with an expected cost under $50,000 should be routed through the Questbook program. The purpose of this proposal is to establish an events strategy for larger initiatives that require substantial funds and active project managers.\n\nIt may also be possible for protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem to partake in events that are put together with funds from this budget. For example, if a community member has an idea for the DAO to have representation at RustConf with an emphasis on showcasing some of the products built with Stylus, Entropy, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC could reach out to protocols building on Stylus to attend the event and showcase their products. Protocols could be expected to \u201cbolster\u201d the events budget. E.g., the DAO spends $100K while 2 Stylus projects put up $10K each to sit at the same booth. This increases the total budget by $20K at no additional cost to the DAO, and these two protocols could showcase their products in a shared booth with Arbitrum branding. This is just one example of how this could look, with the exact structures managed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWe want to emphasize the fact that excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025. We felt some of the other events required a full-time project manager to ensure they go smoothly, and we do not want to take on more than we can handle. However, by requesting more budget than we require, anyone in the community can take lead on an event if there is DAO support.\n\n## Specifications\n\nIn order to eliminate the potential for event overload, we are capping the number of delegate gatherings to two for the year - but are leaving the number of ecosystem growth events open-ended. These events should be planned in such a way that no two events align too closely with one another on dates, with the exception of delegate offsites which could coincide with an ecosystem growth event at a major crypto conference given the convenience of planning travel arrangements. While the primary goal of delegate offsites should be aligning ecosystem leaders and providing a dedicated place/time for more efficient in-person working hours, the ecosystem growth category is more vague in nature. However, all applicants should have clearly articulated goals for the events in line with the defined events strategy, i.e., driving the adoption of Stylus through a hackathon, generating thought-provoking governance proposals, or onboarding new people into the DAO similar to GovHack. Events brought forward by either an individual or service provider, must create a post-event impact report ([example](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethcc-brussels-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/26530)\u00a0from Govhack Brussels) that includes a breakdown of actual costs. Service providers that are procured to execute on an event idea will also be required to provide a post-event impact report.\n\nFor concrete examples of how this could work, we can take a look at the 2 proposals for events currently on the forum. The GovHack Core proposal (which has since been rescinded) was brought forth by Hack Humanity, which serves as a great example of a scenario where the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy would not have been needed in the process at all. Hack Humanity could have taken their proposal to Snapshot, and because they were the service provider themselves, there was no need for any type of procurement process. If the GovHack Core proposal passed snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain, the funds would be sent from the 2025 events budget (this proposal) and Hack Humanity could have begun their planning. This would eliminate the ~4-week onchain voting process and potentially make it possible to put something together for DevCon in Bangkok in just ~2 months.\n\nThis is a prime example of how earmarking an events budget will enable the DAO to move more nimbly. Please note that this proposal is only for 2025, so the previous example is only provided for illustrative purposes. However, it is quite possible that the DAO would rather fund GovHacks on an as-needed/case-by-case basis rather than a whole year, or even open up the event type to other service providers to get new actors involved or potentially lower the price.\n\nIn an earlier iteration of a proposal from\u00a0[@danielo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo), there was no defined offsite facilitator. This is an example of a proposal that did not specify the service provider, so the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy could have worked together in procuring the proper coordinator upon the proposal passing on Snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply and a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain. The procurement process should bring down overall costs by making the process competitive amongst service providers, and again reduces the lead time by foregoing the onchain Tally vote. Note that this is just an example for illustrative purposes.\n\nIt is expected that the contributor requesting a specific event is tasked with defining the measurable KPIs. The DAO will be tasked with deeming a specific events proposal worthwhile via Snapshot, and we encourage delegates to hold these authors to a high standard when it comes to measuring a given event\u2019s impact and how it pushes Arbitrum\u2019s mission forward.\n\n## Flow of Funds\n\nTo cover the $1.5M dollar-denominated expenses, 4M ARB would be earmarked and sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled wallet, with funds liquidated into a preferred stablecoin and then sent to a MSS-controlled address .Surplus ARB will be sent back to the DAO Treasury following the liquidation. Entropy Advisors, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC will be the point of contact for the MSS chair to greenlight any queued transactions. No transactions will be signed without confirmations from all 3 entities/individuals. The MSS may send stablecoins back to the Arbitrum Foundation in order to pay service providers with fiat if required. Excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025.\n\nUpdates related to funds spent, upcoming events and relevant details, a place to provide feedback or recommendations, or any other communications will be posted to the\u00a0[ADPC update thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/procurement-committee/27)\u00a0on the Arbitrum Forum. Alternatively, Entropy can post these to our\u00a0[updates thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/entropy-advisors-updates/50)\u00a0on the Arbitrum Forum.\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n1. September 10th: \u201cEstablishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025\u201d Forum post (4 weeks)\n2. October 10th: Snapshot Vote\n3. October 31st: Tally vote (If Snapshot passes and depending on feedback)\n4. November 18th: The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy Advisors can begin working with OCL/the AF and other individuals/SPs to ensure the events calendar brought forth comes to fruition. Dependent on the outcome of the Tally vote.\n\nWe expect this process to take about 2-3 months in its entirety to get underway, which will provide the DAO ample time to prepare for its 2025 events.\n\n## Overall Ask\n\nThe upfront ask to the DAO is $1.5M and the transfer of 4M ARB with the excess returned to the DAO post liquidation, but with just 3 ecosystem growth events outlined in this proposal, the entire budget will not be utilized. However, as mentioned earlier, earmarking these funds gives the DAO the ability to act more nimbly when there is an opportunity to host an event. This will result in the DAO getting better pricing from potential service providers while ensuring the service provider has ample time to do what they do best - organize great events. The DAO can clawback funds from the MSS at any time via a snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain."

    "description": "# [Updated] Proposal to Establish the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\nThis is a non-constitutional proposal.\n\n**Amendments in light of community feedback:**\n\n* Standard 50,000ARB for the DAOAdvocate role due to the important nature of the role re. the ARDC.\n* Added detail re. clawback functions on \\[Multi-Sig] + \\[Service Provider Streams]\n* Created the ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability] Governor via the Zodiac Governor Module:\u00a0[Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability\\]](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)\n\n**Abstract**\u00a0- This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members\u2019 ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation**\u00a0- The ARDC\u2019s role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale**\u00a0- the ARDC\u2019s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\u00a0- Steps to Implement - The AIP moved to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded,\u00a0[@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer)\u00a0will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\nLink to passed Snapshot proposal:\u00a0<https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf49d88ec2f4fa7373efc66a7cf9441d916519f48a2d90e7db3ea688357150a44>\n\n**Specifications & Timeline**\u00a0- Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Total Cost -**\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n665,000 ARB \\[Security] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n\n1,000 ARB \\[per signer - per month for the 6-month term] \\[Multi-Sig Budget]\n\nUSD16,000 payable in ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining \u2018Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\u2019 or \u2018ARDC\u2019: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members\u2019 ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition\u00a011](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot\u00a07](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC\u2019s mandate will naturally aid in \u2018Governance Optimization\u2019 through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC\u2019s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition\u2019s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO\u2019s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC\u2019s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe\u00a0***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC\u2019s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate\u2019s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem\u2019s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024\u00d7768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF:\u00a0[The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs\u00a03](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)]. Hereunder, we propose an adapted model of Section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to implement to the ARDC Elections.\n\nThe ARDC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the ratification of the on-chain proposal.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has been finalized.\n\nAll ARDC members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ARDC \\[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions].\n\nThere will be four separate elections per vertical based on the intellectual need of the ARDC:\n\n1. The DAOAdvocate;\n2. Risk Management-Oriented Member;\n3. Security-Oriented Member;\n4. Research-Oriented Member.\n\nThe following timeline governs an election process that starts at time T \\[\u2018T\u2019 means the date that the on-chain vote passes +3 days]:\n\n**Governing Rules**\n\n* Applicants may only apply for 1 Role during the election process;\n* Joint applications are permissible under the following conditions:\n\n1. Joint applications must abide by the applicable cap to the corresponding seat to be applied for as voted by the ArbitrumDAO;\n2. An applicant may not apply as part of a joint application with other applicants & then proceed to apply individually for another seat.\n\n* The Fee Structure/Ask must not exceed the applicable cap as voted by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n**Election Process**\n\n***1. Application Submission (T+7 business days):***\n\nAnyone may submit an application on a dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums in conformity with the application template;\n\n***2. KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period (7 business day period following end of Application Submission Period):***\n\nApplicants who would have validly submitted their applications in conformity with the application template will then be required to undergo KYC/KYB processes. All candidates will cooperate with the Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. Only applicants that pass KYB/KYC will be eligible for election.\n\n***3. Amendment Period (3 business day period following the end of the KYB/KYC + Delegate Review period whereby applicants may amend their application):***\n\nApplicants may amend their applications in light of community feedback during this time period.\n\n***4. Member election (7 business day period following end of Amendment Period):***\n\nA Snapshot with rank-choice voting will be put up per vertical including the list of all eligible candidates:\n\n1. Snapshot for DAOAdvocate election;\n2. Snapshot for Risk Management-Oriented Member election;\n3. Snapshot for Security-Oriented Member election;\n4. Snapshot for Research-Oriented Member election.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may approve and implement a Non-Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future ARDC elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.\n\n**Election Application Template**\n\nFor the fee-cap applicable to the role being applied for, please refer to the Funding section. Applicants requesting asks exceeding the corresponding cap will be contacted to amend accordingly.\n\n***Applicant Information***\n\nName of Applicant & Applicant\u2019s Representative \\[If Applicable]:\n\nEmail Address:\n\nTelegram Handle (if applicable):\n\nLinkedIn Profile (if applicable):\n\nRole being applied for \\[1 Max] \\[DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Member, Security-Oriented Member, Research-Oriented Member]:\n\n***Background Information \\[Applicable to all]***\n\nPlease provide a brief overview of your experience in the digital asset industry and, more specifically, Ethereum & Arbitrum Ecosystems.

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member\u2019s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC\u2019s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC\u2019S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it\u2019s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC\u2019s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and members elected:\n\n* Streaming of funds to elected members through Hedgey on a monthly basis. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote as the ArbitrumDAO will be made the Grant Admin on the Hedgey module.\n* Clawback capability as explained hereunder.\n\n**The Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ARDC Multi-Sig via the Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability]:**\u00a0[**Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability\\]\u00a01**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)\n\n**In addition, after the ARDC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ARDC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO\u2019s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.**\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC\u2019s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums."

    "description": "# [NON-CONSTITUTIONAL] Arbitrum Onboarding V2: A Governance Bootcamp\nOn December 12, 2024, the Snapshot vote to launch the [<u>Arbitrum Governance Bootcamp</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb5bbd23c20a480dc46f750112b6cc8f1d1825e40cdd0fc12f4ac3642b18f6740) successfully passed.\u00a0\n\nOne area of feedback questioned the level of interest in protocol matching. In response, we\u2019re pleased to share that Areta, Event Horizon, Gains Network, Gitcoin, Tally, Plutus DAO, and Uniswap Foundation are eager to work with a Governance Fellow to support their governance needs and strengthen their alignment with the DAO. If your organization is interested in working with a Governance Fellow, please complete [<u>this survey</u>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWmKWngdL4PHoZ6nFNEVnHPo1LLJ0pD_F2n2WfvQ-my3k2sg/viewform?usp=sharing).\u00a0\n\nTo ensure the program is impactful, we\u2019ve taken a data-driven approach, gathering insights from 14 Arbitrum stakeholders \u2014 including protocols and service providers \u2014 on their needs, pain points, and priorities for working with a Governance Fellow. These findings have shaped curriculum refinements and additional program improvements to better serve the DAO.\u00a0\n\nThe rest of this update will highlight the changes that we have made between the Snapshot vote and the ongoing Tally vote.\u00a0\n\n**Note**: We have created [<u>a Chatbot</u>](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6769c0f8f3508191aed172caf8b5aa7d-arbitrum-governance-bootcamp-chatbot) to assist you with reviewing the details of the proposal.&#x20;\n\nThe full Snapshot proposal is included at the end.&#x20;\n\n## **Changes Made Since Snapshot**\n\n### **Team Updates**\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Bhaumik Patel, founder of [<u>Atrium Academy</u>](https://atrium.academy/uniswap#hero), as an advisor to our team! Atrium Academy, a Uniswap Foundation grantee, builds immersive cohort-based experiences for advanced solidity developers, with a focus on V4 hooks. See [<u>this case study</u>](https://atrium.academy/case-study) and this [<u>hooks directory </u>](https://hooks.atrium.academy/uniswap-hook-directory)to learn more about Atrium and its impact.\u00a0\n\nWith deep experience building and shipping educational programs, both at Atrium Academy and in previous roles, Bhaumik brings invaluable insights to the Onboarding Working Group. He has already been instrumental in enhancing our operations and refining the curriculum.\n\nMeanwhile, Manu and Angela have transitioned to new roles elsewhere.\u00a0\n\n### **Program Updates**\n\n1\\. Open call for workshop facilitators\n\n* We will launch an open call for applications, inviting anyone in the DAO to apply to facilitate workshops aligned with their subject matter expertise.\n\n2\\. Curriculum refinement based on survey responses.\u00a0\n\n* The program has been tailored to have a greater focus on practical training and exercises that directly address the challenges and priorities of DAO delegates.\u00a0\n\n3.\u00a0 A **smaller budget** (see budget [<u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HW7ESeDLNn5oeNvt5D1dxtP7lVL8ed-MIwkxtU9T-dc/edit?usp=sharing)).\u00a0\n\n* The budget has decreased $21,657 since the Snapshot proposal.\n\n### **Curriculum Refinement**\n\nWe made the following changes to the curriculum based on survey responses to better align with delegate needs:\n\n**1. Governance Goals & Strategic Alignment**\n\nDelegates identified two primary goals with their governance participation:\n\n* Advocating for initiatives that align with their entity\u2019s objectives.\n* Building relationships with delegates and ecosystem participants.\n\nTo support these goals, we have added a workshop on **Strategic Governance** that will cover the following topics:\n\n* How different DAO stakeholders approach governance.\n* Mapping entity goals to DAO objectives.\n* Identifying governance proposals that align with strategic priorities.\n* Structuring proposal narratives to align with broader DAO goals.\n\n**2. Governance Fellow Support & Key Responsibilities**\n\nDelegates highlighted the following areas where Governance Fellows can add the most value:\n\n* Proposal Management & Tracking \u2013 Support in organizing, monitoring, and documenting proposals and initiatives.\n* Participation in DAO-wide Calls & Summarization \u2013 Support in having a presence and sharing information.\n* Grant & Funding Opportunities \u2013 Help in identifying and applying for relevant grants.\n\nTo address these needs, we have added the following workshops:\n\n1. **Governance Reports & Dashboards** \u2013 Teaching participants how to synthesize, analyze, and present governance data effectively.\n2. **Governance Project Management** \u2013 Covering best practices for tracking governance initiatives, including hands-on experience with project management tools and frameworks.\n\n**3. Enhancing Visibility & Influence in the DAO**\n\nSome respondents noted challenges in gaining visibility and influence within the DAO. To help address this, we have added the following workshop:\n\n* **DAO Relationship Management** \u2013 A workshop designed to help participants build credibility, expand their network, and engage strategically with key DAO stakeholders. This session will cover:\n  * Effective communication strategies\n  * Relationship-building with key stakeholders\n  * Navigating DAO dynamics\n  * Leveraging governance communication platforms\n\nAdditionally, the Onboarding Working Group will offer Fellows 1:1 office hours during their Fellowship for personalized support.\n\n## **Schedule**\n\n| **Week** | **Workshop Title**              |\n| -------- | ------------------------------- |\n| 1        | Arbitrum DAO Governance Basics  |\n| 2        | Strategic Governance            |\n| 3        | Governance Reports & Dashboards |\n| 4        | Governance Project Management   |\n| 5        | Arbitrum Tech Deep Dive         |\n| 6        | DAO Relationship Management     |\n| 7        | Work on Exercises               |\n| 8        | Work on Exercises               |\n\nParticipants will have access to video tutorials and additional reference materials created by the Onboarding Working Group. All workshops will be recorded.\u00a0\n\nDetailed workshop materials are available in the Appendix.\n\n## **Exercises**\n\nAt the conclusion of the six-week workshop series, participants will have two weeks to complete practical exercises, applying the knowledge they have gained.\n\nThe top 10 submissions will have the opportunity to be matched with an Arbitrum Protocol or Service Provider, where they will gain real-world governance experience as Governance Fellows.\n\nParticipants who are not selected for matching will be invited to join the next cohort on a fast-track basis, bypassing the application and interview process. This creates a positive feedback loop, ensuring multiple opportunities for individuals to engage with Arbitrum governance and contribute meaningfully over time. Each cohort will feature updated content and refined sessions to enhance the learning experience.\n\nThe next section provides sample exercises, which may be adjusted to better align with the evolving needs of the DAO.\n\n### **Sample Exercises**\n\nThese exercises provide Governance Trainees with hands-on experience in core governance activities\u2014commenting on forum posts, analyzing proposals, and engaging in DAO-wide calls\u2014while also increasing their visibility on social media and the Governance Forum.\n\nThe exercises are designed to address the governance needs of onboarded Service Providers and Protocols, incorporating insights from collected survey responses.\n\n### **Graduation & Matching Criteria**\n\nTo graduate and be eligible for matching with a Protocol, Governance Trainees must complete all five mandatory exercises. Bonus points will be awarded for completing optional exercises.\n\n### **Mandatory Exercises**\n\n**1. Draft and submit a proposal idea**\n\n* Based on the DAO\u2019s vision, goals, and strategy, trainees will create a proposal idea and submit it for feedback in the Governance Forum.\n* This group exercise (3-4 participants) fosters engagement with the governance process and alignment with DAO priorities.\n\n**2.Analyze a recent governance proposal**\n\n* Explain how different stakeholders (service providers, protocols, delegates) might vote on it.\n* This helps trainees understand governance dynamics and stakeholder decision-making processes.\n\n**3.Engage in Governance Forum discussions**\n\n* Comment on at least three different proposals with thoughtful feedback or questions.\n* Encourages active participation in governance discussions.\n\n**4.Attend an Open Discussion of Proposals call & share insights**\n\n* Join a live governance discussion and write a recap on X.\n* Encourages active participation in governance discussions.\n\n**5.Identify and summarize a grant opportunity**\n\n* Research and summarize a grant program within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Delegates identified sourcing grant opportunities as a governance need, making this a valuable skill for Governance Fellows.\n\n### **Bonus Exercises (Optional for Extra Points)**\n\n* **Write a blog post** explaining how to participate in Arbitrum DAO governance and share it on X.\n* **Post about the Governance Bootcamp** on X, sharing thoughts or highlights.\n* **Share insights after each workshop** in a thread, summarizing key takeaways.\n* **Summarize recent governance proposals** in a concise thread to keep the community informed.\n\nThese exercises ensure that trainees develop essential governance skills while actively contributing to Arbitrum DAO\u2019s governance ecosystem.\n\n## **Facilitator Training**\n\nWorkshops will be led by experienced stakeholders from the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem, selected through an application process managed by the Onboarding Working Group. Interested facilitators can apply by selecting up to two workshops they are willing to lead.

DAO\u2019s Onboarding Program for 7 months.\n\nEarlier this year, the Onboarding Working Group ran a three-month Pilot Program (V1) to bring new participants into the DAO. Based on feedback from delegates and ecosystem participants, we\u2019ve applied key lessons learned to create V2\u2014a more robust and refined iteration of the program.\nV2 will function like a Governance Bootcamp and the Onboarding Working Group will act akin to a recruitment agency, sourcing and training a select group of new DAO contributors.\nThe Onboarding Working Group is comprised of the following individuals: @Manugotsuka from @SEEDGov, @ocandocrypto from @web3citizenxyz, @san from Reserve Protocol, and @RikaGoldberg from @404DAO. Our advisors are @krst and @Sinkas from L2Beat.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nArbitrum DAO needs to onboard high-quality and diverse (**see note 1**) governance participants to thrive in the future. Currently, fragmented information, siloed resources, and private communication channels create a culture of exclusivity, making it challenging for newcomers to navigate the governance process and contribute meaningfully.\n\nIn V1, we pioneered a solution by running a Pilot Program where we hosted weekly onboarding calls and grouped participants into one of five Fellowship tracks based on their interests and skills. Ultimately, each Fellowship was expected to collaborate and work on a Proposal to publish on the forum.\n\nBased on the lessons learned in V1 (details are\u00a0[here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/onboarding-pilot-program-final-report-milestone-3/26046)), we have developed V2, a more robust and meritocratic Onboarding Program. V2 focuses on selecting high-quality participants, training them, and assessing their skills\u2014 ultimately matching top performers with Arbitrum Protocols that need a Governance Fellow. (**see note 2**)\n\n**Note 1**:\u00a0*In an effort to increase diversity within Arbitrum, we are committed to ensuring that at least 25% of program participants are female/non-binary. This ratio is aligned with the representation in the Pilot Program (V1). We will also focus on inclusivity, creating opportunities for LGBTQ+ and applicants from underrepresented regions, including developing countries, throughout the application and interview process.*\n\n**Note 2**:\u00a0*V2 does not guarantee program participants with long-term placement in the DAO.*\n\n## Key Terms\n\n**Governance Analyst**\u00a0\u2014 An individual who is selected into V2 based on their application and interview.\n\n**Governance Fellow**\u00a0\u2014 A Governance Analyst who successfully graduates from the program and is subsequently matched with a Protocol to assist with Governance work.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Onboarding Program consists of the following components:\n\n* An Application and Interview Process.\n* A Curated Curriculum and Workshops.\n* Exercises to assess comprehension of workshop materials.\n* A Rubric to evaluate and grade exercises.\n* Completion NFTs/Forum Badge for Governance Analysts and Fellows\n* An updated DAO Contributors List\n\nThese components are described in detail below.\n\n## Applications and Interview Process\n\nTo assess candidates for experience and cultural fit, V2 will include a one-month rolling application period followed by a month of interviews, after which twenty applicants will be selected to join the program.\n\nWe will be seeking applicants with specific characteristics, including a positive mindset, an ability to work well with others, an aptitude to engage in healthy debate, and an eagerness to learn. Furthermore, applicants should have a high-level of familiarity with Ethereum and L2s.\n\n## Workshops\n\nOver the course of 6 weeks, the selected cohort of 20 Governance Analysts will participate in weekly workshops that cover critical concepts (see Curriculum section) of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s governance process.\n\nThe workshops will be primarily facilitated by Manugotsuka (Manu), a Governance Contributor at @SeedGov, who is most notably involved in managing Arbitrum\u2019s Delegate Incentive Program. Members of the SEEDGov team will also support Manu as needed.\n\n## Curriculum\n\nThe following governance content will be covered in the workshops:\n**Note: You can find links to all content in the original**\u00a0[**forum**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrum-onboarding-v2-a-governance-bootcamp/27546)\u00a0**post.**\n\n### Arbitrum Protocol Basics:\n\n* A gentle introduction to Arbitrum\n* Get started with Arbitrum\n\n### Arbitrum DAO Governance Basics\n\n* The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO\n* How to Delegate your Voting Power\n* How to Submit a DAO Proposal and Docs\n* Writing Your First Proposal to the ArbitrumDAO\n* Proposal Lifecycle (RFC, Snapshot, Tally)\n* Constitutional vs. Non Constitutional Proposals\n\n### An Introduction to the Arbitrum Foundation\n\n* The role of the Arbitrum Foundation\n\n### Arbitrum DAO: Important Proposals\n\n* Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO\u2019s Operations\n* COI & Self Voting Policies\n* Incentives Detox Proposal\n* Code of Conduct\n* Mission, Vision, Purpose\n\n### Arbitrum DAO: Important Initiatives\n\n* Delegate Incentive Program\n* Working Groups, Committees, Councils and Service Providers\n* Security Council\n* Key Delegates\n  -Multisig Support Services (Entropy)\n* Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025\n* Stylus Sprint\n* Grants Programs: (Foundation, Questbook)\n* Additional Grants resources: GrantsDAO\n\n### Arbitrum Tech Deep Dive\n\n* How to create a Dapps on Arbitrum\n* Orbit Chains Technical Introduction\n* A gentle introduction: Stylus\n* Quickstart: Arbitrum bridge\n\n### Arbitrum DAO Tools and Resources\n\n* Karma Delegate Dashboard\n* Arbitrum Hub\n* Arbitrum DAO Twitter\n* Arbitrum DAO Updates\n* Governance Forum\n* Arbitrum DAO Calendar\n* Foundation-led: Bi-weekly Proposal Discussions Call\n* Monthly Governance Reporting Call\n* Telegram Updates Channel\n* Weekly Voting Reminders\n* Snapshot\n* Tally\n\n*Note: Recordings will be shared on X to maximize the educational content\u2019s distribution and reach.*\n\nA week-over-week schedule is presented in the below table:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.snapshot.box/ipfs/bafkreif3e3yjzza3btoh3yxsnei7atvve2yljb6fx443kbg7ienscfid34)\n\n## Exercises\n\nAt the conclusion of the 6 weeks of workshops, participants will have two weeks to work on practical exercises to apply the knowledge they gained.\n\nThese exercises, along with the grading rubric, will be designed by Sandra Carillo (a V1 Pilot Program Fellow, Project Manager at Reserve Protocol, and Developer).\n\nThe top 10 submissions will be eligible to be matched with an Arbitrum Protocol where they will acquire real-world governance experience as Governance Fellows (more details in the \u2018Governance Fellows\u2019 section).\n\nThose not selected for matching will be invited to participate in the next cohort on a \u201cfast-track,\u201d bypassing the application and interview process. This creates a positive feedback loop, providing multiple opportunities for individuals to be matched with a Protocol and contribute to Arbitrum governance.\n\nThe next section provides Sample Exercises.\n\n### Mandatory:\n\n1. Draft a mock proposal for Arbitrum DAO and submit it for feedback on the Governance Forum \u2013 This encourages participants to actively engage with the governance process, understand proposal creation, and contribute thoughtful feedback. This is an exercise that can be made in groups of 3 or 4 people.\n2. Comment on at least three different Governance Forum proposals, providing thoughtful feedback or questions \u2013 This ensures participants are involved in governance discussions and contributing to decision-making.\n3. Write a blog post explaining how to participate in governance for Arbitrum DAO and share it on X or Farcaster\u2013 This promotes deeper understanding of the DAO structure and helps educate the broader community.\n4. Attend an Open Discussion of Proposal(s) call and write a thread about your experience on X or Farcaster \u2013 Participation in live discussions helps foster community engagement and ensures participants are informed about ongoing governance. As the Open Discussion of Proposal(s) happens every 2 weeks, the participants will have the opportunity to attend to at least 1 call.\n5. Share on the governance forum how you would vote on a proposal that\u2019s currently in active voting, explaining your rationale and feedback \u2013 This promotes critical thinking and encourages participants to articulate their rationale on voting process.\n\n### Bonus Points\n\n1. Write a tweet or a cast about the Arbitrum DAO Onboarding Program on X or Farcaster: Share your thoughts or highlights from the onboarding experience, spreading the word about how others can get involved.\n2. Share your insights after each workshop in an X or Farcaster thread: Reflect on key takeaways and learnings from the workshops, helping others benefit from your knowledge and fostering community discussion.\n3. Write a thread summarizing recent governance proposals and share it on X or Farcaster: Provide a clear, concise overview of the latest proposals to keep the community informed and encourage broader participation.\n4. Write a tweet thread explaining how ARB token holders can participate in governance and share it on X or Farcaster: Educate the broader community by breaking down how ARB holders can engage in governance, making the process more accessible and encouraging more involvement.\n\n*Note: These exercises will be refined before V2 starts.*\n\n## Rubric\n\nThe rubric that we will use to grade Exercise submissions is provided in the below table. We drew inspiration from the Rubric created by SeedGov for the Delegate Incentive Program.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.snapshot.box/ipfs/bafybeifjdau4h2r25gg74fqljlajldtt7slpgjtrnrq6vuzbghqnmwsv4u)\n\n*Maximum points per exercise: 25 points*\n*Maximum points for completing 5 mandatory exercises: 125 points*\n*Maximum points for completing 5 mandatory exercises and 2 bonus exercises: 175 points*\n\n## Governance Analysts and Fellows\n\nThe highest-scoring Governance Analysts (up to 10 individuals), based on rubric evaluations, will graduate to become Governance Fellows and will be matched with a protocol to assist with governance work.\n\nEach Fellow will be paid a monthly stipend of $1,500 USD in ARB. The Onboarding Working Groups will support Fellows during these two-months to ensure maximum alignment and success.\n\nOcandocrypto (Angela), a Contributor at Web3Citizen and an Arbitrum DAO Delegate, will manage the relationships between Protocols, Governance Fellows, and the Onboarding Program.\n\nIf your protocol is interested in working with a Governance Fellow, please indicate that in your comment on this forum post or reach out directly to Angela @ocandocrypto on Telegram.\n\n## KPIs\n\nWe will be measuring the Onboarding program\u2019s success with quantitative KPIs. To ensure alignment and leverage existing DAO programs, we will base these KPIs on the metrics tracked in the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP v1.5).\n\nSpecifically, we will be using the following metrics (please refer to the Karma delegate dashboard):\n\n* Snapshot Voting (SV)\n  *KPI: Percent increase in SV from beginning to end of program*\n* Tally Voting (TV)\n  *KPI: Percent increase in SV from beginning to end of program*\n* Commenting Rationale\n  *KPI: Percent increase in SV from beginning to end of program*\n* Delegates Feedback (DF)\n  *KPI: Percent increase in DF from beginning to end of program*\n\nWe will use a 6-month trailing average will be used to calculate the program\u2019s starting baseline for each metric, smoothing out monthly variability in the number of proposals. For the program\u2019s endpoint, we will use a 3-month trailing average, aligned with the 3-month duration of the Fellowship.\n\nTo ensure realistic expectations for Fellows, we will use a 5% increase as a baseline goal for each metric.\n\n## KYC\n\nGovernance Fellows will need to KYC with the Foundation in order to receive the stipend. We will work with the Foundation on this process.\n\n## MSS\n\nWe plan to use the MSS services for payment.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe have intentionally allocated ample time, 2 weeks, for delegates to respond and provide feedback on the forum. We will incorporate the feedback and make necessary revisions before posting to Snapshot.\n\nExpected Timeline:\nRFC Discussion:\u00a0*November 18 - Dec 2*\nSnapshot:\u00a0*Dec 5 - Dec 12*\nTally:\u00a0*January 6 - January 27*\nWe are planning to start the Program on February 10, 2025 and end on September 29, 2025.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe are proposing a budget of $193,138 USD (including a 30% volatility buffer and accounting for an ARB price of $0.69) paid in ARB over 7 months. Any unused ARB will be returned to the DAO.\n\nA detailed budget breakdown can be found here:\u00a0[Arbitrum Onboarding WG Budget V1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MNFl_Uko0tY5kiG1F4eoLbYeA7EU5W5RDb_RBKTJ9ec/edit?gid=1283170482#gid=1283170482).\n\n![image](https://ipfs.snapshot.box/ipfs/bafkreidqkbhiyes56ltf3v6ggmrdzd7pddqbxypdd66mwwix6b23gtqmeu)"

    "description": "# AIP-1.2 - Foundation and DAO Governance\nCategory: Constitutional - Process\n\n## Abstract:\nThis document (\u201cAIP-1.2\u201d) proposes amendments to the Constitution, and The Arbitrum Foundation Amended & Restated Memorandum & Articles of Association (the \u201cA&R M&A\u201d) and Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) to (1) remove references to AIP-1, and (2) make other changes reflecting feedback from the community.\n\n## Motivation:\nAIP-1 set out critical aspects of governance and included key governance documents for the ArbitrumDAO, and The Arbitrum Foundation which referenced AIP-1 throughout: the ArbitrumDAO Constitution (the \u201cConstitution\u201d), the Bylaws and the A&R M&A. However, after vigorous community debate, AIP-1 did not pass.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe Constitution is a foundational document that lays out the governance system and capabilities of the ArbitrumDAO; the Bylaws and A&R M&A outline The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s relationship with and obligations to the ArbitrumDAO. These documents should be updated, via amendment, to remove references to AIP-1 and also to reflect other changes requested by the community during the debate process over AIP-1.\n\n## Specifications:\n\n1. Amendments to the Constitution ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link))\n- Remove references to AIP-1, except as reference to the moment the original Constitution became effective.\n- Make explicit that proposals to amend The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s A&R M&A and Bylaws take the form of a Constitutional AIP.\n- Make explicit that the DAO may make a Non-Constitutional Funding AIP with respect to the Administrative Budget Wallet.\n- Lower the threshold number of Votable Tokens required for an AIP to be posted on-chain from 5,000,000 $ARB to 1,000,000 $ARB.\n- Add a new Section 5, which details the Data Availability Committee, including processes for removing and appointing Data Availability Committee members.\n\n2. Amendments to the Bylaws ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link))\n- Remove references to AIP-1.\n- Clarify that the definition of \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d includes all assets that are contributed to or otherwise acquired by the Administrative Budget Wallet, inclusive of assets specifically approved by the ArbitrumDAO. As pointed out by the DAO in its feedback in response to AIP-1, the \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d defined term in the Bylaws was unclear and didn\u2019t clearly reflect the reality of The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s receipt of 7.5% of the token supply upon the $ARB token genesis.\n- Remove references to \u201cSpecial Grants\u201d and replace with the concept of Arbitrum ecosystem growth.\n- Remove \u201cAIP Threshold\u201d defined term as it is not used elsewhere in the Bylaws\n- Clarify that the ArbitrumDAO may replace The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s directors, change the number of directors, and require The Arbitrum Foundation to take certain actions.\n\n3. Amendments to the A&R M&A ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link))\n- Remove references to AIP-1.\n\nLinks:\n- Snapshot temperature check: [https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x373dfa89fc9c5ccba8ed83fa3fa4f233edd270075b5f8f4f3902b408318d9d17](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x373dfa89fc9c5ccba8ed83fa3fa4f233edd270075b5f8f4f3902b408318d9d17)\n- GitHub PR: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44)\n- Forum thread: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-2-foundation-and-dao-governance/13362/58](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-2-foundation-and-dao-governance/13362/58)\n"

    "description": "# Funds to bootstrap the first BoLD validator\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is seeking **5,134 ETH**, which is a combination of:\n\n* **Assertion and challenge bonds.**\u00a04,234 ETH to allow the Arbitrum Foundation to run a BoLD validator and fulfill the role of being the first honest and active proposer.\n* **Service fees.**\u00a0500 ETH to pay proposers who are actively participating and advancing the chain. We estimate the funds will last for 3 years of operation and the Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to collect any service fees.\n* **Refund L1 gas costs.**\u00a0400 ETH to reimburse all L1 gas costs for active proposers who are actively advancing the chain and defending against malicious challenges, assuming 1 challenge per year.\n\nThis proposal is **contingent** on the proposal \u201c[AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1)\u201d (constitutional AIP) being approved by the ArbitrumDAO. If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD does not pass - then the Arbitrum Foundation will return the funds, in its entirety, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days of the\u00a0[BOLD proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1)\u00a0being hypothetically rejected.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe\u00a0[AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1)\u00a0is scoped to only propose the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet include the introduction of an economic incentive mechanism. In the absence of an economic incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n# **Key Terms**\n\n* **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. In order to become an active proposer for Arbitrum One, post-BoLD, a validator has to propose an L2 state assertion to Ethereum. If they do not have an active bond on L1, they then need to attach a bond to their assertion in order to successfully post the assertion. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. There can only be 1 \u201cactive\u201d proposer at any point.\n* **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.\n* **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n* **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n* **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n* **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer\u00a0*must*\u00a0have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n* **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer once their assertion is confirmed. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n# **Budget Request**\n\nThis section focuses on the budget request from the ArbitrumDAO treasury alongside the motivation for why the funding is required.\n\n## Assertion and Challenge Bonds (4,234 ETH)\n\nWe are requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.\n\nThe requested ETH is a combination of:\n\n* 3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;\n* Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the\u00a0`RollupCore.sol`\u00a0contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the\u00a0[BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1)\u00a0passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One\n\n**Note: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active validator, not the ONLY validator. BOLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run nodes and validators for Arbitrum chains upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.**\n\n## Service Fees for BOLD Validators (500 ETH)\n\nAll blockchain systems, including Arbitrum, should reward participants who actively work to advance the system.\n\nIn the case of Arbitrum, the DAO will pay a service fee to an active proposer who is helping to advance the system by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet. At the time of writing, the estimated annual income is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH, according to the\u00a0[Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr).\n\n**We must highlight that this payment is a fee and not a reward**. In BoLD, a new assertion can be posted every round (1 hour) and only a single fee is paid per round. There can be multiple agents who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1. The proposer whose assertion is accepted by L1 and paid the service fee is called the active proposer for this round. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice\u2019s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded.\n\nWe estimate the following service fee per year:\n\n* Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer.\n\nThe Foundation is therefore requesting 500 ETH to support service fee payments for **up to 3 years (with a buffer of 68 ETH in case the average Ethereum validator income increases)** in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. Moving forward, the DAO may consider allocating a portion of ETH from the ArbitrumDAO governed chains\u2019 sequencer fees to fund the ongoing service fees for active proposers.\n\nTo learn more, please read the section on\u00a0[Service Fees in the BOLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7).\n\n***Note: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee.***\n\n## Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs (400 ETH)\n\nWe are requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain. It is estimated that 400 ETH will be sufficient to cover ~3 years of operational costs.\n\nThere are two on-chain gas costs:\n\n* **Posting assertions.**\u00a0An active proposer must post an assertion for the chain to advance.\n* **Challenges.**\u00a0A proposer who is defending the system must participate in a multi-round challenge process.\n\n*Note: we only propose to reimburse L1 gas costs since that is publicly verifiable and computable by all. The off-chain costs to run a proposer will not be reimbursed and it is expected the service fee will be sufficient to help cover the operational cost for it.*\n\n### Estimated Reimbursement Costs\n\nThis section focuses on the estimated costs to reimburse the L1 gas costs for proposers who are actively posting assertions and participating in the challenge process.\n\n#### Assertion Gas Costs\n\nThe on-chain gas costs for posting assertions are available from the BoLD testnet deployed on\u00a0[Arbitrum Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x06a5851f1d2daa5312161efefb62f0c561319f46ca97215a0fbe144774b6d65e):\n\n* **\u2018stakeOnNewAssertion\u2019 function.**\u00a0It costs 163,109 gas per invocation.\n\nAssertions are expected to be posted every hour and under normal operations:\n\n* 163109 gas \\* 24 hours \\* 365 days = 1,428,834,840 gas per year.\n\nIf we assume 50 gwei/gas on L1 Ethereum, then the estimated total gas costs will be 71.44 ETH/year. This equates to 214.32 ETH for a 3-year period.\n\n#### Challenge Bonds Gas Costs\n\nA challenge should only occur if a dishonest proposer posts an assertion that is not valid. Given the financial cost to a dishonest proposer, we are not expecting many challenges to occur. Even so, we should always be prepared for the worst-case scenario and be ready to defend against it.\n\nAccording to the\u00a0[BoLD whitepaper\u00a01](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491)\u00a0and theoretical calculations conducted by the Offchain Labs team, honest moves to defend a full challenge will cost honest parties roughly 62,632,000 gas (not including the top-level assertion).\n\nPer challenge, the L1 gas costs will depend on the gas price at the time of the challenge:\n\n* At a 50 gwei/gas price, this equals 3.1316 ETH in L1 gas costs\n* At a 100 gwei/gas price, this equals 6.2632 ETH in L1 gas costs\n* At a 500 gwei/gas price, this equals 31.316 ETH in L1 gas costs\n\nAssuming one challenge per year for 3 years in the worse case scenario on gas prices, we estimate 93.93 ETH will be required.\n\n#### *Gas Cost Summary*\n\nAssuming a nominal gas price of 50 gwei/gas during normal operations (i.e. no challenges) and assuming an elevated 500 gwei/gas price during a challenge (i.e. worst-case scenario), to fully reimburse an honest party\u2019s gas costs incurred for posting assertions and for performing honest moves to defend Arbitrum in the event of one challenge per year, the Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 400 ETH for 3 years.\n\nThis includes ~308 ETH to cover the above costs and a ~92 ETH buffer in the event of higher gas prices during normal operations, during a challenge, and/or in the event that there is more than one challenge per year.\n\n# Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate. (completed)\n2. Two separate temperature checks on Snapshot (both passed).\n   a.\u00a0[**Bond sentiment**](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x81cc53932edd0891c8f93a502a1ea929ba1ef1ebf76701663c52d5167b323a6d)**.**\u00a0Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s request for 4,234 ETH to run the first BOLD validator and to cover for one BOLD challenge.&#x20;\n   b.\u00a0[**Operational cost sentiment**](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x9a4800da3ebd6792a59f02d70467fc6ae158ec2d3d1d941cf095a54cb7c7f0d5)**.**\u00a0Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer. Total request is 900 ETH to cover a 3-year period.\n3. **Onchain AIP on Tally** (this vote)\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to 2 multi-sig wallets controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.&#x20;\n   a. The first multi-sig wallet (Multi-Sig A) will receive 4,234 ETH for posting the bond assertion to become the first BoLD validator, as well as to cover for one BoLD challenge, and&#x20;\n   b. the other multi-sig wallet (Multi-Sig B) will receive the 900 ETH meant for service fees and L1 gas costs reimbursements.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the 3,600 ETH from Multi-Sig A (first multi-sig) in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the\u00a0[AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1)\u00a0is passed.\n\n# Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 5,134 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n\n* Multi-Sig A\n  * 3600 ETH to run the first BOLD-enabled proposer for Arbitrum One,\n  * 634 (555 + 79) ETH budget to counter one BOLD challenge,\n* Multi-Sig B\n  * 500 ETH as service fees for active BOLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and,\n  * 400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.\n\n**Notable points:**\n\n* **Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to the service fee,**\n* **Arbitrum Foundation will be reimbursed for the L1 gas costs,**\n* **All service fee payments will be manually processed by the Arbitrum Foundation on a periodic basis (weekly or monthly) alongside a requirement that all payments adhere to the Foundation\u2019s compliance process.**\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to 2 multi-sig SAFE addresses controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation,  and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO. Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO reserves the right to revoke the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s proposer at any time and return the bonds (i.e. 3600 ETH from Multi-Sig A) back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n\n* **Withdrawal Address.**\u00a0The funds will be deposited into BoLD and the withdrawal address set to the \u2018UpgradeExecutor\u2019 contract on L1.\n* **Triggering Withdrawal.**\u00a0The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s treasury).\n\nArbitrumDAO also reserves the right to revoke the 634 ETH budget to counter one BOLD challenge (Multi-Sig A); the 500 ETH budget for service fees (Multi-Sig B) and the 400 ETH to reimburse L1 gas costs (Multi-Sig B). The DAO can revoke these funds by raising and passing a Snapshot proposal that requests the Arbitrum Foundation to return the relevant funds to the DAO treasury. The Snapshot proposal will have to meet the quorum of a non-constitutional AIP in order to pass. The Arbitrum Foundation is bound by its [<u>bylaws</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf) to serve the needs of the DAO, so if the DAO decides that it wants to clawback funds, the Foundation will be obliged to do so.\n\nPut another way, the ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds back to the ArbitrumDAO treasury. This model can be used for future proposals if other entities want to run a proposer on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO."

    "description": "# AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency [UPDATED]\n\n## ATTENTION:\n\nThis is an updated version of a similar proposal that has been put up for a vote a day prior to this one. We have discovered that the target vesting contract in the previous proposal had an incorrect \"start\" date. A more detailed explanation is provided below. Please do not vote on the other proposal and vote on this proposal instead.\n\n### What happened?\n\nThe way this proposal works is that there is a special AIP smart contract (AIP1Point1Target) that references the location of the vesting vault for the Foundation Administrative Budget Wallet. The on-chain action that the proposal is executing is changing of the \u201cpassed\u201d parameter on this AIP smart contract from false to true, documenting DAOs approval for the Foundation to use this referenced vesting vault, after the vote the Foundation will move 700M ARB tokens that are subject of AIP 1.1 to this contract and will be able to retrieve the vested amount to the Foundation\u2019s multisig. \n\nOne parameter of this setup is a \u201cstart\u201d timestamp, which determines the point in time from which the vesting schedule is being calculated. According to the text of AIP-1.1: \u201c\u2026ARB tokens in the \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO\u2026\u201d. So this timestamp should be set to 1681754400, which translates to Monday, 17 April 2023 18:00:00 GMT, the date of the Snapshot approval. However, in the vesting contract that was subject to the original vote, it has been wrongly set to the date of the ARB Airdrop (1679590871, which translates to Thursday, 23 March 2023 17:01:11 GMT). This means that the smart contract configuration did not reflect the text of the AIP and would result in the effective unlocked vested amount being too large.\n\n### Resolution\n\nSince we cannot cancel the vote at this point (it could be canceled by the Security Council, but only after the vote has passed), after thorough discussion, we have decided to create a new proposal with the correct smart contracts that are referenced in the vote. We recommend that the DAO ignore the other AIP-1.1 vote, and instead vote on this one.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to check the parameters are set correctly this time, you can check (for example using Arbiscan) the AIP smart contract referenced by this vote: [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9E43f733Da0445b35f038FB34a6Fb8C2947B984C#code](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575). In the Contract tab you can go to the Read contract sub-tab and check that the arbitrumFoundationWallet parameter references smart contract at [0x15533b77981cda0f85c4f9a485237df4285d6844](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x15533b77981cda0f85c4f9a485237df4285d6844), which is the vesting vault. You can now go to this smart contract and, again, go to the Contract tab, and Read as Proxy sub-tab to see that the \u201cstart\u201d parameter is set correctly to 1681754400. \n\nWe hope that this resolution will cause as little confusion as possible among delegates. We plan to publish \"lessons learned\" from this case at a later date to elaborate on this case and suggest certain procedures to be implemented in the future to minimize the chances of such mistakes happening again. \n\n\n***\n\n\nCategory: Non-constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\ntl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation\u2019s \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation\u2019s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup \u2013 linearly unlocking over 4 years \u2013 alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation\u2019s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\n### Motivation\n\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n\n- Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n- Control over the DAO treasury\n- Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n- All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n- Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain\u2019s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that\u2019s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum\u2019s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Rationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation\u2019s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation\u2019s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\n- Operating Budget: Cost ($USD)\n- General and Administrative: $16,000,000\n- R&D: $9,000,000\n- Technical Infrastructure: $5,000,000\n- Events, Marketing & Communications: $6,000,000\n- Total - Next Twelve Months: $36,000,000\n- (50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation\u2019s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation\u2019s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation\u2019s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation\u2019s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation\u2019s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup).\n\n### Links:\n\nPrevious version of this proposal with misconfiguration issue: [https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\nSnapshot temperature check: [https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae)\n\nGitHub PR: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44)\n\nForum discussion thread: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1)"

    "description": "# [Constitutional] ArbOS 31 \u201cBianca\u201d (Stylus, RIP-7212 Support, Nova Fee Router)\n# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes the activation of\u00a0**ArbOS 31**\u00a0on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This ArbOS upgrade brings a number of improvements, including:\n\n* Activating Arbitrum Stylus to enable developers to build the next generation of Rust or C++ applications on the EVM.\n* New precompile for verifying the\u00a0[secp256r1 elliptical curve](https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/what_is_secp256r1)\u00a0(as part of\u00a0[RIP-7212\u00a01](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md))\n* Change to fee collection on Arbitrum Nova, making it easier for ArbitrumDAO to manage and access the funds.\n\n**This AIP combines the following three temperature checks:**\n\n* [AIP: Activate Stylus and Enable Next-Gen WebAssembly Smart Contracts\u00a01](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x330ed0f609da63cf4b67b932ab0665a76e1c7d6a7789f3383339bad79c789d2b)\n* [AIP: Support RIP-7212 for Account Abstraction Wallets\u00a01](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2f73825f375d59a5d3c8b05074e17140a4967e6ccb6fe20a58f836f865fcaae5)\n* [AIP: Nova Fee Router Proposal\u00a02](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65)\n\nA new ArbOS 31 \u201cBianca\u201d was released between the time of the temperature check votes and submitting this proposal. ArbOS 31 release builds upon ArbOS 30 and includes new optimizations that were discovered during rigorous testing and feedback from Stylus teams. The ArbOS upgrade is shipped as a new Nitro node release alongside new upgrades to the rollup contracts for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n*Note: ArbOS 31 \u201cBianca\u201d will be the canonical ArbOS version for the \u201cBianca\u201d family of releases.*\n\n> **Since the DAO has already signaled support for the adoption of all three changes in all three temperature checks, this proposal will proceed to an on-chain AIP on Tally next.**\n\n# Changes included\n\n### 1. Activation of Arbitrum Stylus: a new WebAssembly-based (WASM) VM to support smart contracts written in Rust and C++\n\nStylus is an upgrade to the\u00a0[node software](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro)\u00a0that powers all Arbitrum chains. This upgrade introduces a new WASM-based Virtual Machine (VM) that runs alongside the EVM. This enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.\n\nStylus is a first-of-its-kind technology resulting from breakthrough engineering efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Unlike other alternative VMs, the Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM & is instead purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable. The two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. Support for more memory efficient and safer languages will unlock a new generation of applications that were previously impossible to build on the EVM.\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover were originally developed as a fork of the\u00a0[Nitro](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro)\u00a0codebase before. The Stylus codebase has since been audited ([Trail of Bits audit report\u00a01](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-05-offchain-arbitrumstylus-securityreview.pdf)) and merged back into the Nitro codebase:\n\n* [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus: Stylus VM and Fraud Prover](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus)\n  * Merged into the Nitro codebase in:\u00a0[Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield \u00b7 Pull Request #2242 \u00b7 OffchainLabs/nitro \u00b7 GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2242)\u00a0and\u00a0[Stylus v2 by tsahee \u00b7 Pull Request #2425 \u00b7 OffchainLabs/nitro \u00b7 GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2425)\n* [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth)\n  * Merged into Offchain Labs\u2019 fork of Geth in:\u00a0[Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield \u00b7 Pull Request #305 \u00b7 OffchainLabs/go-ethereum \u00b7 GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/305)\n* [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts)\n  * Merged into the Nitro-contracts codebase in:\u00a0[Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield \u00b7 Pull Request #170 \u00b7 OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts \u00b7 GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/170)\n\nStylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability. For example, existing Solidity DEXs can list Rust tokens without modification. New SDKs for additional programming languages can be added over time. Current SDK repositories:\n\n* Rust SDK:\u00a0[GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs: Rust Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs)\n* C/C++ SDK:\u00a0[GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c: C/C++ Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c)\n* Stylus CLI:\u00a0[GitHub - OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus: Cargo subcommand for developing Arbitrum Stylus projects in Rust](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus)\n\nIf you would like to better understand the lifecycle of a Stylus contract, head over to\u00a0[A Gentle Introduction: Stylus\u00a01](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction). For teams who are curious to learn more about how Stylus is expected to interact with their project\u2019s existing infrastructure, we encourage folks to check out this\u00a0[Stylus launch ecosystem one-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-FGC1sO5DlypyEW77r83GJUHuuipHGUY2Tvlvqr7GWk/edit).\n\nNote: Support for Stylus contract verification is currently under development by major block explorers. We expect that contract verification will be fully supported before ArbOS 31 Bianca gets activated on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, pending the DAO\u2019s decision to adopt this proposal.\n\n### 2. Addition of a new pre-compile, to Arbitrum Nitro, that reduces the costs of verifying the secp256r1 elliptic curve as part of\u00a0[RIP-7212\u00a01](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md)\n\nPasskeys offer a solution that removes the need for a web3 user to personally store a private key for their wallet. Passkeys accomplish this by leveraging WebAuthn, a global standard for passwordless authentication used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and all major web browsers. The private key generated when creating a passkey can be encrypted and can only be decrypted using a specialized hardware module called the Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave ensures a user\u2019s private key can never leave the device, transforming any compatible device into a hardware wallet. Users can authorize transactions with biometric features like Touch ID or Face ID when using passkey-based wallets for key management. These qualities add flexibility and significantly improve UX while maintaining high security.\n\nAdding support for\u00a0[RIP-7212\u00a01](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md)\u00a0decreases the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve on-chain\u00a0[by 99%](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/what-is-rip-7212)\u00a0when compared to current implementations, making them more feasible for everyday use and enabling dApp developers and protocols to offer their users improved UX on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Without a precompile, verifying this signature on-chain is extremely expensive. Passkey-based wallets offer a better level of security than a typical EOA and seamless cross-device support. Many wallets, and notably, apps using embedded wallets, have been requesting this feature for over a year.\n\nThe specifications of\u00a0[RIP-7212\u00a01](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md), including test cases, can be found in the\u00a0[RIP repository\u00a01](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md). If approved, Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova will use this specification as the reference for implementation. The\u00a0[Ethereum Magicians Forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7212-precompiled-for-secp256r1-curve-support/14789)\u00a0discusses design decisions, iterations, and the transformation of the proposal from an EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) to a RIP.\n\nThis pre-compile is part of Nitro 3.1.0 and was added to our fork of Go Ethereum in\u00a0[Add Precompile for secp256r1 conditionally based on ArbOS version by anodar \u00b7 Pull Request #303 \u00b7 OffchainLabs/go-ethereum \u00b7 GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/303)\u00a0and has been upstreamed into Nitro 3.1.0. Nitro 3.1.0 is the minimum supported version of Nitro for ArbOS 31 \u201cBianca\u201d.\n\n### 3. Update all Nova fund distributors to use a series of \u201cfee routers\u201d instead, while keeping the final destination as the ArbitrumDAO Treasury\n\nToday, the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s portion of the transaction fees from Arbitrum Nova are sent to the\u00a0[Core Governance L1 Timelock address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951D92B0C345144506576eC13Ecf5103aC905a), which is accessible via the core governance system. This setup is disadvantageous because any time the ArbitrumDAO wishes to spend/move the funds, a roundtrip, constitutional proposal must be passed before the DAO.\n\nThis proposal updates the setup such that all Arbitrum Nova transaction fees, that are currently sent to the Core Governance L1 Timelock Address, are instead sent to a system of \u201cfee routers\u201d that automatically send all funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury. Benefits of this new setup include:\n\n* Lower quorum requirements for moving these funds (3% vs. the current 5%)\n* No ~2 week delay to spend funds (since a constitutional vote would not be needed, as per the\u00a0[Lifecycle and anatomy of an AIP](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal))\n* Simpler accounting and bookkeeping, since all the funds would be in the ArbitrumDAO treasury.\n\nThis new, proposed system of \u201cfee routers\u201d results in a fee collection lifecycle as follows:\n\n1. A\u00a0`distributeRewards`\u00a0function call is made on the\u00a0`RewardDistributor`\u00a0contract, sending funds to a\u00a0`ChildtoParentRouter`\u00a0contract\n2. Either upon receiving funds or via a call to\u00a0`routeFunds`, the\u00a0`ChildToParentRouter`\u00a0creates an\u00a0[L2-to-L1 message](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/arbos/l2-l1-messaging)\u00a0which sends the contract\u2019s full Ether balance.\n3. The L2-to-L1 message is executed, transferring the Ether to a\u00a0`ParentToChildRouter`\u00a0contract on L1.\n4. `routeFunds`\u00a0is called on\u00a0`ParentToChildRouter`, creating a retryable ticket which transfers its full Ether balance to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One.\n\nNote that the addresses deployed during the\u00a0[Snapshot vote\u00a02](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65)\u00a0for the\u00a0`ParentToChildRewardRouter`\u00a0and\u00a0`ChildToParentRewardRouter`\u00a0have been re-deployed at\u00a0`[0x40Cd7D713D7ae463f95cE5d342Ea6E7F5cF7C999](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x40Cd7D713D7ae463f95cE5d342Ea6E7F5cF7C999)`\u00a0and\u00a0`[0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d)`, respectively.\n\n# Implementation\n\nAll of the above changes were independently audited.

However, that includes a lot of code that isn\u2019t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 20 or ArbOS 31 with bash:\n\n\\# !/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -e\n\nmkdir -p ~/tmp\n\n\\# This script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output\n\n\\# This script should be run in the nitro repository:&#x20;\n\n\\# Checkout and update submodules for consensus-v31\n\ngit checkout consensus-v31\n\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\nmake .make/solgen\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter nitro dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v31-nitro-files.txt\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter geth dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v31-geth-files.txt\n\n\\# Checkout and update submodules for consensus-v20\n\ngit checkout consensus-v20\n\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\nmake .make/solgen\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter nitro dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter geth dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt\n\n\\# Combine and sort nitro dependencies\n\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v31-nitro-files.txt > ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt\n\n\\# Combine, sort, and filter geth dependencies\n\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v31-geth-files.txt | sed 's@^\\[./]\\*go-ethereum/@@' > ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt\n\nNow, ~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 20 or ArbOS 31. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\ngit diff consensus-v20 consensus-v31 -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)\n\nThe fraud prover is not part of the on-chain upgrade, but may be helpful in understanding the fraud proving smart contract changes and other components:\n\ngit diff consensus-20 consensus-v31 -- arbitrator/prover arbitrator/wasm-libraries/ arbitrator/arbutil ':!\\*\\*/Cargo.lock' ':!\\*\\*/kzg-trusted-setup.json'\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 20 and 31 used:\n\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v20 go-ethereum\n\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de go-ethereum\n\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v31 go-ethereum\n\n160000 commit 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 go-ethereum\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each Nitro commit. Then, you can again use git diff and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n\\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\n\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.13.3 and v1.13.11, as ArbOS 20 used the former and ArbOS 31 uses the latter.\n\nTo filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs:\n\nGit diff intersection finder\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 31\u2019s go-ethereum against ArbOS 20\u2019s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 31\u2019s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.13.11:\n\n\\# This should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\n\n\\# Generate diff between two specific commits and save to file\n\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-31-geth.diff\n\n\\# Generate diff between upstream geth and nitro geth, and save to file\n\ngit diff v1.13.11 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-31-vs-upstream-geth.diff\n\n\\# Run the diff-intersection script with the specified diff files and ignored files\n\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-31-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-31-vs-upstream-geth.diff --ignore-files 'core/blockchain\\*.go' arbitrum\\_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/\\*\\*' 'rpc/\\*\\*'\n\nThe above command ignores files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used with these arguments:\n\n`--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'.`\n\nTo also review those diffs, you can remove those arguments.\n\nNote that by default, [diff-intersection.py](http://diff-intersection.py) does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag."

    "description": "#  Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0\n**Summary:** This proposal proposes to allocate 125,000 $ARB tokens, equal to 0.00125% of the total supply, to recognize and reward the outstanding contributions of the Arbitrum community member known as \"Arbiter\". Arbiter receives the arbiter community role in the arbitrum discord after having made significant contributions to Arbitrum, as recognized by members of the Arbitrum team.\n\nOver the three-year period 2021-2023, these contributors played a key role in the development of Arbitrum, from translating, advising, publicizing, and docking projects to community support, fraud prevention, and docking activities etc. At the time of the Arbitrum DAO's inception, Arbiters did not receive any airdrops or rewards.\n\nBy establishing a transparent and fair reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, our goal is to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication to the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Considering that arbiters did not keep proof of their contributions before and after the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO, and that a great deal of their work could not be counted or quantified, the dedication of each arbiter is also exceptionally valuable.\n\nAll members of arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal as a whole and agreed on an equal share of the reward amount.\n\n**Foreword:** 25 Arbiters come from different countries with different time zones, speak different languages. Arbiters have been deprecated by the Arbitrum team, and it has become extremely difficult to bring arbiters together. Arbiters who have made outstanding contributions to the Arbitrum community from 2021 to 2023. Compared to on-chain activists and ecosystem projects which have conducted a large number of airdrops, arbiters haven\u2019t received any airdrop retroactive rewards\n\nConsidering the large number of contributions made by arbiters prior to the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO that have not been effectively preserved, and the fact that there are many members whose work cannot be counted and quantified, and that the dedication of each arbiter has been exceptionally valuable, all members of the arbiters have agreed that arbiters as a whole should initiate the proposal. All members of Arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal and apply for retroactive awards for Arbiters as a whole.\n\nArbiter as a whole (or project) is asking for retroactive rewards. If each member's contribution is listed one by one to make a forced comparison, this will bring arbiter infinite tug-of-war, mutual disputes, suspicion etc.. At the same time, Arbiter is not professional to establish a very systematic and perfect evaluation system.\n\nSpecial statement: As the earliest arbitrum contributor, arbiter is retroactively obtaining voting rights and voice in the governance of Arbitrum DAO. The Arbitrum DAO airdrop to early adopters and ecosystem projects also does not take price into account, but rather the weight of governance. The choice of 125,000 $ARB is fully considered (explained in detail below). If the current arb price is $0.1, the arbiter also only apply for 125,000 $ARB, which has little to do with price.\n\n**Motivation:** The Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\n1.Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum\u2019s development.\n\n2.Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\n\n3.Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\n\n4.Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n**Rationale:** The Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in shaping Arbitrum over the past two years. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.\n\nPlease review the forum post for full proposal details: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-empowering-early-contributors-the-community-arbiter-proposal-2-0/20404"

    "description": "# Arbitrum DAO Grants - Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook\nAuthor Saurabh, Questbook\n\nType Non-Constitutional\n\n### **Abstract**\n\n- We propose Arbitrum DAO to launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a\u00a0*wide variety*\u00a0of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading\u00a0[Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136)\u00a0grants program through\u00a0[delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/)\u00a0, a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by\u00a0**4**\u00a0**individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a\u00a0*domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these\u00a0*domain allocators*\u00a0will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each\u00a0*domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/)\u00a0)\u00a0**will help facilitate setting up these\u00a0*domain allocators*\u00a0and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members\n\n## **Rationale (Benefits to Arbitrum)**\n\nThe proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:\n\n1. Aligned allocation of funds: By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum\u2019s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.\n2. Increased transparency: The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook\u2019s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. Increased accountability: With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. Lower Turnaround Time (TAT): The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals\u2019 turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. An example of this is Compound who\u2019s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours. The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.\n5. Strong Brand Recognition : The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas.\n\n### Specifications\n\nThe program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator\u2019s performance.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\n**Arbitrum Grants Committee**\n\nThe program will consist of\n\n1. A Program Manager\n2. 4 Domain Allocators\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uIjprH3.png)\n\nWe propose [Tally\u2019s Zodiac Governor Module](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/questbook-arb-dao-grants) for security purposes, furthermore, a Grants SAFE with a 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and four domain allocators, one member from the DAO. We will then have four SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/4 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, one more domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.\n\n**[Questbook ARB DAO GRANTS](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/questbook-arb-dao-grants)** acts as a security layer for grants multisig, empowering ARB holders to control multisig when needed.\n\nCurrently, we have four signers on the Safe, and the Safe is 3/4  until the domain allocators are elected by the community. As a result, we will have three temporary signers:\n\n1. Saurabh - Program Manager\n2. Frisson - Arbitrum Delegate \n3. Coinflip - Arbitrum Delegate\n4. Matt Stable Labs - Arbitrum Delegate\n\nHere\u2019s the multi-sig address: [0xB7c1551BBEB47Eb86266153df5F9D7dA47F08308](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0xB7c1551BBEB47Eb86266153df5F9D7dA47F08308)\n\nWe have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0wompF.png)\n\n### Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:\n\nThe following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.\n\n1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs\n        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum\n        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders\n        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements\n        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly\n        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program\n        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls\n        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the grants program\u00a0and progress each selected project such as:\n        \n![](https://i.imgur.com/IAmytlJ.png)\n\n2.  Grants Program: \n  a. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities\n  b. Sign the transactions for the approved projects\n  c. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision\n  d. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly    distributed and take their feedback consistently\n\n1. Domain Allocator:\n    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator\n    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network\n    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.\n\n### **Compensation:**\n\nThe grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unused funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qz3RmPL.png)\n\n**P.S** \n\nWe are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Tally, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted. \n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\nObjective\n\n1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum\u2019s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects\n3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas\n4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)\n5. Increase in the community members\u2019 participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Arbitrum\u2019s community call\n7. Increased engagement in builder community\u2019sDiscourseDiscord, TelegramSocial media (Twitter, Reddit)GitHub\n\nSubjective\n\n1. Improved community involvement in the grants program\n2. Strengthened builders\u2019 sentiment towards Arbitrum\n3. Enhanced Arbitrum\u2019s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook\u2019s role in Arbitrum\u2019s Grant Program\n\n- Saurabh from Questbook will be the program manager. Thereafter, the program manager will be elected from the community. Saurabh was previously working very closely with the Program manager of Polygon, where he facilitated the disbursement of approximately $1 million in grants. Saurabh has received a grant from IoTeX to establish their grant program, and he works closely with the Program Manager of Compound Grants Program 2.0. Saurabh has spoken to more than 100 builders and teams over the last 6-8 months and understands what it takes to make a grant program successful - from both program manager and builder perspectives.\n- Questbook Grants tool will make sure the workflows are systematic and transparent.\n\n### Product Flows\n\n1.

Executive Summary**\n\n### **Background**\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (\u201dADPC\u201d), composed of Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal, is coming to the end of its first phase on August 20, 2024. As such, this proposal aims to extend the ADPC\u2019s tenure into Phase II for a 6-month period, which will commence on the date on which the Tally vote for this proposal is executed on-chain.\u00a0\n\n### **Outcome**\n\nThe ADPC\u2019s pilot phase proceeded successfully, with significant outcomes to Arbitrum DAO and a range of key learnings for the committee. Creating a comprehensive procurement process from the ground up to ensure that Arbitrum is seen as a leader not only in the technical sphere but also within decentralized governance has been a great opportunity.\n\nWe laid the foundation for the ADPC to be an effective set-up bringing the benefits of well-structured procurement to Arbitrum DAO. Cost savings will result from the creation and use of procurement frameworks and marketplaces developed by the ADPC uniquely for Arbitrum DAO as well as the necessary legal and operational infrastructure and strategic sourcing methodology.\n\n### **Way Ahead**\n\nThe ADPC's initial phase was conducted as a proof of concept demonstrating the capability of the team and the benefits arising from the strategic use of advanced sourcing methodology. The ADPC proposes to build on these successes into Phase II of the ADPC's engagement. In this Phase II, the ADPC, after careful alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO, proposes to work on all of the following work packages:\n\n**1.** **Work Package 1: Procurement for 2 tactical verticals**\n\n* Vertical 1 will be focused on procuring RPC providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on engagement with delegates and stakeholders as well as an understanding of the core services required by all projects looking to build in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Vertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal. Please note that the ADPC will not request any funding for its events services procurement in that separate proposal.\n* The scope within the 6-month term is to develop evaluation criteria, draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP/tender), evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s. Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in the scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those internal legal processes.\n* Further details on our process for arriving at these shortlisted verticals can be found below in the section on Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II.\n\n**2. Work Package 2:** Continued management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services and, based on the success of the first cohort, publishing the proposal for an extension of the fund.\n\n**3. Work Package 3**\n\n* Definition and creation of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget for the Arbitrum DAO, to be custodied by the Multi-Signature Safe (MSS), and allocated towards the utilisation of service providers as whitelisted by the ADPC. This creates a utilisation rail for the DAO to be able to utilise the services of the whitelisted service providers procured by the ADPC. Without this in place, the DAO is unable to utilise these service providers without the full proposal process (Forum, Snapshot, On-Chain).\n* The ADPC will draft and propose the OpEx proposal to the DAO;\u00a0 further details, including the process and procedure for utilization of the OpEx budget by the DAO, will be outlined in this separate proposal to the DAO. This seperate proposal will contain multiple options for the size of the OpEx budget for the community to vote on.\n\n**4. Work Package 4**\n\n* Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have \\[published]\\(https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as) for Phase I, and submitting it to the DAO.\n* Continued alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).\n* Ad-hoc tasks, e.g., aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.\n\n**5. Optional Additional Verticals:** On completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to \\[2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks.\n\nThe overall budget for the 6-month term will be USD 414,000 including OpEx, details on which can be found below in the Budget & Methodology section. The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be 954,608 ARB based on the time weighted average ARB price of $**0.5204**/ARB as further outlined below. A buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC multi-sig under the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) is still able to satisfy payments to the ADPC's members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury.\n\nThe multi-sig requested to manage the funds is within the [<u>Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836) established by Entropy Advisors. The Multi-Sig that has been created by the MSS is the following address:\n\n**arb1:0x13d4Ff2A83fBCB8F5fc73cE66CF5928eD0943cB0**\n\nAfter receipt of the ARB, the ADPC will convert as much of the requested amount as is required to obtain 414,000 USDC and will return the unutilized ARB to the DAO treasury. This is intended to avoid fluctuations in ARB price and ensures that the ADPC avoids using the buffer as much as possible.\u00a0\n\nThe ADPC will utilize a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Gauntlet's Aera solution to convert the program\u2019s ARB into USDC for operational purposes. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilizes off-chain logic to monitor on-chain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ADPC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modelling and executed on Odos, or Bebop. Based on current market conditions, it would take approximately one week to trade out of 414K USD worth of ARB with minimal impact.\u00a0\n\nOnce the ARB is converted into USDC, the Aera vault will utilize LlamaPay to stream the total payment due to the ADPC member wallet addresses over the course of the 6-month period (120k USDC per member, 360k USDC in total). The remainder of the converted funds (54k USDC) will remain in the MSS as the OpEx budget. This process will be coordinated with the MSS chairs and members.\n\nFurther details about the ARB conversion strategy and about Aera can be found below in the 'ARB Conversion Strategy' section below.\n\n**Note**: The proposal includes the re-election of the current members of the ADPC. For any future extension terms of the ADPC, the process outlined in the original Tally vote will stand unless automatic renewal of the then-current members is proposed. Of course, this will be subject to the potential OpCo that gets formed and any implications that may have on the structure of the ADPC.\n\n### **Acknowledgements**\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the consistent participation and deep input from the Arbitrum community, delegates, and stakeholders, without whom our progress would not have been possible. We would especially like to thank the security service providers who deeply engaged with the program from the very beginning. We would also like to thank all respondents to the ADPC\u2019s outreach in determining the procurement frameworks to tackle in Phase II, including @bobbay, @JoJo, @Frisson, @realdumbird, @IronBoots, and @krst, among others.\n\n# **II. Background of the ADPC**\n\nThe ADPC was established as a crucial component of the Arbitrum ecosystem's governance structure, following a successful proposal and subsequent community vote in early 2024. The formation of the ADPC was driven by the growing need for a structured, transparent, and efficient approach to procurement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the ecosystem's growth, security, and sustainability.\n\nThe inception of the ADPC can be traced back to discussions within the Arbitrum community about the challenges faced by projects building on the protocol, particularly in securing high-quality service providers. These discussions highlighted the need for a pre-emptive quality assurance mechanism that could benefit the entire ecosystem. Against the background that a dedicated procurement framework has, to our knowledge, not been established in any DAO prior, the committee's formation marked a pivotal moment not only in Arbitrum's governance evolution, but set a precedent for DAOs in general. We designed the ADPC to address immediate needs and to create a foundation for future growth and efficiency in the ecosystem.\n\nPhase I of the ADPC ran for a duration of 182 days from February 21, 2024 (i.e., the day that the KYB for the ADPC members was completed) until August 20, 2024.\n\nThe ADPC\u2019s mandate in Phase I consisted of the following:\n\n### **A. Oversight of Security-Oriented Service Providers Framework**\n\nOversee and facilitate the Procurement Framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### **B. Subsidy Fund Research & Proposal**\n\nResearch and draft a proposal to set up a subsidy fund for security-oriented services to subsidize the costs for security services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### **C. Development of Eligibility Framework (\u2019Means Test\u2019)**\n\nResearch and implement a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized\u00a0 to assess a project's eligibility for the subsidy fund referred to in paragraph \\[B] above.\n\n### **D. Establishment of Future Procurement Frameworks**\n\nEstablish procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service types that the Arbitrum DAO could need in the foreseeable future.\u00a0\n\n### **E. Creation and Communication of Guidance**\n\nCreate and communicate guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time.\n\n# **III. Achievements & Progress**\n\nThe ADPC made significant progress against its mandates:\n\n**A. Oversight of Security-Oriented Service Providers Framework**\n\nThe ADPC finalized and [<u>published</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031) extensive RFP documentation for whitelisting security service providers on June 19, 2024. This comprehensive framework is designed to establish a marketplace for whitelisted service providers to offer services pursuant to pre-agreed terms, conditions, and pricing to projects that have been granted subsidies under the Security Services Subsidy Fund Proposal.\n\nThe development of the RFP documentation was an intensive, multi-stage process that involved various stakeholders and multiple rounds of refinement. The key stages included:\u00a0\n\n1. Creating an initial draft that incorporated research on best practices in procurement frameworks and multiple internal drafting sessions;\n2. Working with DeDaub to integrate specific technical requirements into the RFP;\n3. Working with the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s legal team to align the legal documents with the Foundation\u2019s policies and guidelines;\n4. Conducting a final review by the ADPC, DeDaub, and the Arbitrum Foundation;\n5. Publishing the final documentation.\n\nThis procurement framework, being the first of its kind, set a new standard for procurement processes in the crypto space.\u00a0\n\nThe RFP received responses from 12 security service providers and the whitelisting of these providers is still in progress. We expect to execute the agreements necessary for enabling engagement in September 2024.\n\n**B. Subsidy Fund Research & Proposal**\n\nThe ADPC researched, drafted, and passed a [<u>proposal to set up a subsidy fund for security-oriented services</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/3552942192106351362095426680857341385146921274641698065112264407057470303359); the development of the proposal was strongly influenced by community engagement, while the terms and conditions for the receipt of the subsidy (\u2019Means Test\u2019) were mainly based on our experience from traditional procurement processes.\n\nThe [<u>initial Subsidy Fund proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958) incorporated:\n\n1. A comprehensive benchmarking exercise with 10 leading security audit service providers which was conducted to analyze costs and scope of typical security audits to determine the fund size and allocation;\n2. A detailed evaluation framework with weighted criteria for the \u2018Means Test\u2019; and\n3. Timelines and procedures for application submission and review.\n\nFollowing the publication of the initial proposal, the ADPC engaged in extensive community discussions. Key points of feedback included concerns about the large fund size and potential for inefficient capital allocation and questions about the capacity to manage such a large fund.\u00a0\n\nIn response to community feedback, the ADPC revised the proposal. In particular, the subsidy fund was reduced to $2.5 million worth of ARB (75% reduction) to potentially fund up to 12 projects for one cohort of 8 weeks and with a maximum subsidy per project of $250K (10% of the total fund).\u00a0\n\nThe ADPC also listened to and incorporated community feedback about the ADPC managing the initial subsidy fund itself. As a consequence, the ADPC translated raised community concerns into a concrete governance proposal to create a separate \u201c[<u>Security Services Subsidy Fund Sub-Committee</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-set-up-a-sub-committee-for-the-security-services-subsidy-fund/23766)\u201d, consisting of five members elected through a weighted voting system with a proposed compensation of 60,000 ARB in total. However, after thorough discussion, the community voted against the creation of the sub-committee, leaving the disbursement of funds under the subsidy fund to the ADPC.\n\n**C. Development of Eligibility Framework (\u2019Means Test\u2019)**\n\nThe [<u>Means Test</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958) and the related [<u>Grant Application T\\&Cs</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view) were uniquely developed for Arbitrum DAO as a structured approach to evaluate applications for financial assistance. The primary goal of the Means Test is to identify applicants who would benefit most from support with the potential for significant positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem while (i) ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem and (ii) preventing exploitation by larger players.\n\nFor this assessment, we:\n\n1. Developed a scoring system with a 1-5 rating scale and assigned weights to criteria based on importance.\u00a0\n2. Developed four main criteria categories, each with weighted sub-criteria: Arbitrum Ecosystem Contribution, Business Model & Need for the Subsidy, Financial Analysis and a Risk Analysis.\u00a0\n3. Based on community feedback, we further identified key verticals that are particularly valuable to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\u00a0\n4. Implemented a two-stage evaluation process, with an initial screening focused on the five highest-weighted sub-criteria before conducting an in-depth review with a comprehensive evaluation of all criteria for top-scoring applicants.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**D. Establishment of Future Procurement Frameworks**\n\nWhile our primary efforts were focused, due to the complexity of the undertaking and the high level of community engagement and input, on the oversight of the security-oriented service providers framework, the research and proposal of the subsidy fund, the development of the eligibility framework ('Means Test') and the creation and communication of guidance, we did conduct work to identify and prioritize potential verticals for future procurement frameworks. Our approach was to create a comprehensive and adaptable methodology that could be applied to various service categories, ensuring that future frameworks would be developed with a robust approach.\n\nMore detail about our exploration into future procurement frameworks can be found in the section on [<u>Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) below.\n\n**E. Creation and Communication of Guidance**\n\nThe ADPC achieved its goal of keeping the community abreast of its activities and progress during the entirety of its first phase by:\n\n1\\. Setting up a bi-weekly 1 hour call on the Arbitrum governance calendar to engage with delegates and community members;\n\n2\\. Establishing a [<u>dedicated dashboard</u>](https://www.notion.so/Public-Dashboard-a1d953a54c7949c38d9882792f90a7a0?pvs=21) including the Meeting Minutes of each week\u2019s internal ADPC standing meeting and the ADPC\u2019s current task list;\n\n3\\. Creating a [<u>dedicated Telegram channel</u>](https://t.me/+lyn8LCx7_3U5NTU0) to communicate with RFP applicants;\n\n4\\. Scheduling two AMA sessions to field and answer queries from RFP applicants; and\n\n5\\. Publishing a [<u>forum post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031) explaining how the entire Procurement Framework operates.\n\n# **IV. Key Learnings & Improvements from Phase I**\n\nA comprehensive set of learnings and recommendations can be found in the [<u>ADPC\u2019s Phase I Outcome Report</u>](https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as). A subset of the most important of these learnings that we will implement in Phase II are:\n\n**Financial Management & Budgeting**\n\nGiven the nature of this initial phase being a pilot, the budget for Phase I was more \u2018experimental\u2019, and thus did not fully account for all necessary resources. As such, this proposal will include a comprehensive budget plan and management that:\n\n* Creates a fit-for-purpose budget model based on data collected during Phase I; this model is further explained in the [<u>Budget & Methodology</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) section below;\n* Bakes in Operating Expenses to account for unexpected challenges and opportunities;\n* Allocates budget for specialized external consultants to address complex issues efficiently (such as DeDaub in Phase I); and\n* Increases the number of FTE personnel to adequately cover all aspects of the ADPC's mandate.\n\n**Clear Alignment with Arbitrum Foundation**\n\nTo improve effective coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation, in Phase II we will:\n\n* Designate specific points of contact within both the ADPC and the Arbitrum Foundation for different areas of collaboration (e.g., legal, technical, strategic). As needed, the points of contact will be with the DAO Relations team;\n* Establish regular check-in meetings between the ADPC and Arbitrum Foundation;\n* Implement a clear escalation path for urgent matters or deadlocks;\n* Develop a mechanism for early Foundation review of legal frameworks;\n* Coordinate timelines for legal reviews and feedback.\n\n**Create a Long-Term Vision for the ADPC\u2019s Role in Supporting Arbitrum**\n\nAs can be seen in the [<u>Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) section below, we have already begun to identify a list of selected procurement frameworks the ADPC can tackle over its next and future phases. To compile this list, we used a comprehensive methodology, involving community feedback and engagement, and took into account current market conditions and need for Arbitrum.\n\nIn Phase II, we will further outline the ADPC\u2019s role in the continued growth of Arbitrum and ensure that it forms an important part of the DAO\u2019s structure going forward, including as a key component of the OpCo.\n\n**Community Engagement & Transparency**\n\nWhile we spent significant time and resources on community engagement and providing regular, detailed updates, this part of our mandate was more time-consuming than anticipated but crucial for the success of initiatives. Key learnings that we will implement in Phase II are to:\u00a0\n\n* Implement a clear process for incorporating community input into decision-making;\n* Improve the public dashboard to inform better about the ADPC and showing even more information on real-time progress;\n* Develop comprehensive onboarding materials for community members interested in ADPC activities.\n\n# **V. Phase II Mandate**\n\nThe ADPC proposes the following work packages in Phase II:\n\n### **Work Package 1: Procurement for 2 Tactical Verticals**\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Vertical 1. Procuring RPC Providers**\n\nVertical 1 will be focused on creating a whitelisted panel of RPC providers that can be procured by projects currently building or looking to build on Arbitrum. This panel of RPC providers will enable streamlined access and transparent pricing during the project\u2019s build phase or post-launch, adding to the ecosystem of support services for Arbitrum projects and Orbit chains.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe have chosen this vertical based on discussions with key delegates and stakeholders, given that a key focus for Arbitrum is to grow the Orbit ecosystem, while RPC costs are relatively high and RPCs are critical for projects to deploy, similar to security audits. Moreover, the technical due diligence around infrastructure providers is a huge time suck for projects. Pre-vetting RPC providers would make it much more attractive for projects to build on Arbitrum.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn case there is any major opposition to the selection of this vertical, the ADPC will in the first month of Phase II engage with key delegates and stakeholders to arrive at a final decision on the vertical to tackle. The stakeholders we have engaged with have demonstrated an interest in each of the verticals listed below. To find such a substitute vertical, we will:\n\n* Shortlist key stakeholders to schedule calls with;\n* Liaise with the Arbitrum Foundation to identify relevant legal and regulatory considerations associated with these frameworks;\n* Create engagement surveys to be shared with key delegates and projects building on Arbitrum to identify their one prioritized vertical from the below four verticals:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/6d3da625-529b-4cfb-baa9-4ef39d1cae33_original.png)\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/7cc0015d-e57a-494d-85cc-79855272c3c6_original.png)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor further information on the methodology we used to shortlist these frameworks, see the [<u>Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) section below.\n\n**Vertical 2. Procuring Events Providers**\n\nVertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC, Entropy Advisors will first create an events & sponsorships strategy while, in parallel, event providers will be whitelisted. Second, individual RFP processes will be conducted to procure event services for specific events defined in the event strategy from the whitelisted panel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPlease refer to the \u201cRFP - Establishing a DAO Events Strategy for 2025\u201d proposal for granular detail on how this procurement process will be constructed when it is published in the coming weeks.\n\n**Scope for Work Package 1**\n\nThe scope within the 6-month term is to:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1. Develop evaluation criteria;\n2. Draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP / tender);\n3. Evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s.\n4. If need be, research and begin the process of setting up a subsidy fund for the RPC providers vertical (or, if the need arises, a substitute vertical chosen by the DAO). This will include the development and ratification of the Means Test for that specific fund, community engagement and research to determine the size of the fund, drafting a proposal to pass the fund through Arbitrum governance, and if need be, the set-up of a separate sub-committee to manage the fund.\n5. For the Events vertical, conduct individual RFP processes to procure event services for specific events defined in the event strategy from the whitelisted panel.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Note:**\n\n* Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those external parties.\n* To streamline our financial budget, the management of any subsidy fund other than the legacy subsidy fund for security service providers is not included in this scope. The management of newly formed subsidy funds could be conducted either by a separate sub-committee or by the ADPC (as decided upon by the DAO), and will be subject to an additional management fee which will be included in any extension proposal.\n\n### **Work Package 2: Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services**\n\n**Scope for Work Package 2**\n\n* The management of the Security Services Subsidy Fund was not part of the ADPC\u2019s mandate in Phase I. However, as decided by the DAO, the ADPC was elected to manage the first cohort of the Subsidy Fund, which we hereby include in the scope for this work package.\n* Communication of key learnings and improvements from the first cohort of the Subsidy Fund.\n* The ADPC will conduct in particular the following tasks to manage the Subsidy Fund (non-exhaustive):\n  * Setting up the infrastructure for running the program;\n  * Defining and executing the marketing strategy;\n  * Scanning inbound applications, filtering for scams/junk, and reviewing each application;\n  * Onboarding of grantees, including a welcome email with acceptance, set up of comms channels, coordinating KYB/KYC, etc.\n  * Setting milestones for funding and progress;\n  * Ensuring milestone alignment with program objectives;\n  * Setting clear project deliverables;\n  * Tracking progress;\n  * Executing funding alongside the Arbitrum Foundation;\n  * Preparing the End-of-Program report;\n  * Act as the point of contact and \u2018customer service\u2019 for all grant applicants.\n* Depending on the success of this first iteration, market conditions, and demand from the DAO, the ADPC may propose an extension of the fund for one or more cohorts.\n* Depending on discussions with the community and delegates and learnings from the first iteration of the fund, the ADPC will either propose a separate sub-committee to manage the fund or will propose to manage the next iteration of the fund itself. Both of these options will require additional fund management costs which will be included in any Subsidy Fund extension proposal.\n\n### **Work Package 3: Creation of OpEx (Operational Expense) Budget for the DAO to Utilize Whitelisted Service Providers**\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO currently faces significant inefficiencies in its ability to engage with service providers, particularly those whitelisted by the ADPC. Presently, any effort to solicit services, such as a security audit, requires the DAO to navigate the entire governance proposal life cycle \u2014 a process that can extend over a month for just a single deliverable. This protracted timeline not only delays critical operations but also impedes the DAO's ability to respond swiftly to emerging needs, creating a bottleneck that hinders operational efficiency.\n\nTo address these inefficiencies and better equip the DAO for future needs, we will propose the establishment of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget. This budget is designed to streamline the DAO\u2019s interaction with ADPC-whitelisted service providers by creating a direct utilization rail. This rail will allow DAO initiatives and contributors to access and utilize these pre-approved service providers without undergoing the cumbersome proposal process for each engagement. The OpEx budget essentially bypasses the bureaucratic hurdles that currently plague the DAO\u2019s procurement process, enabling a more agile and responsive operational framework.\n\nThe OpEx budget will be initially administered by the Multi-Signature Service (MSS), ensuring that funds are allocated specifically for the utilization of ADPC-whitelisted service providers. The ADPC will draft the initial proposal for the OpEx budget, which will include detailed guidelines on its usage. Importantly, while the ADPC will establish the budget, it will not have control over its management or the approval of expenditures, thus maintaining a clear separation of duties and preserving DAO oversight.\n\n**Why is an OpEx Budget Needed?**\n\nCurrently, the DAO\u2019s engagement with service providers is hampered by a rigid and time-consuming process that involves submitting a governance proposal, conducting a Snapshot temperature check, and finally, holding an on-chain vote. This multi-step process is not only inefficient but also stifles the DAO\u2019s ability to procure services in a timely manner, particularly in scenarios requiring quick action. By introducing an OpEx budget, we aim to eliminate these bureaucratic barriers, creating a streamlined pathway for the DAO to access necessary services from ADPC-whitelisted providers.\n\nMoreover, the OpEx budget is not just a temporary fix; it is a strategic initiative designed to future-proof the DAO\u2019s operations. As the DAO evolves, the OpEx budget can be seamlessly integrated into future organizational structures, such as the prospective OpCo, which has been under discussion. By establishing this budget now, the DAO ensures it has a ready-made, adaptable infrastructure in place to meet its future operational needs. This forward-thinking approach not only addresses current inefficiencies but also lays the foundation for a more resilient and responsive organizational framework.\n\n**Key Aspects of the Proposal**\n\n1. **Funding Allocation**: The amount allocated to the OpEx budget will be determined through a governance vote, with the ADPC providing multiple options for consideration. The funds will be held in the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) set up by Entropy Advisors, dedicated exclusively to services procured through the ADPC\u2019s whitelisted providers.\n2. **Effective Utilization**: The proposal will outline the procedures for the DAO to efficiently utilize the OpEx budget, ensuring that all expenditures are subject to appropriate oversight while still allowing for the flexibility needed to address immediate operational needs.\n\n**Benefits of the Proposal**\n\n1. **Immediate Access**: The OpEx budget will enable the Arbitrum DAO to quickly and efficiently engage with service providers without the delays imposed by the current governance process.\n2. **Foundation for Future Operations**: This initiative serves as a foundational step toward future-proofing the DAO\u2019s operations. By establishing relationships with service providers now, the DAO will be better positioned to transition into more complex organizational structures in the future, with an established operational framework already in place.\n\nIn summary, the introduction of an OpEx budget addresses the current inefficiencies in the DAO\u2019s procurement process by providing a streamlined mechanism for engaging with service providers. It also future-proofs the DAO by laying the groundwork for its evolving operational needs, ensuring that the DAO can continue to operate efficiently and effectively as it grows and adapts.\n\n### **Work Package 4: Outcome Report, Definition of ADPC Vision and Role, and Ad-Hoc Tasks**\n\n**Scope for Work Package 4**\n\n* Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have [<u>published for Phase I</u>](https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as), to be submitted to the DAO. The Outcome Report will consist of:\n  * Achievements and Progress from Phase II;\n  * Financial Overview;\n  * Overview of Community Engagement;\n  * Challenges;\n  * Key Learnings & Recommendations;\n  * Outlook.\n* Continued definition of ADPC vision and role in the DAO:\n  * The DAO is currently in the process of determining its ways of working and operational structure for the short and long-terms. There have been extensive discussions among key delegates and community members around the set-up of an OpCo, and Areta has (tentatively) defined how the ADPC could fit into such a structure in the [<u>final report for the M\\&A Pilot Phase</u>](https://docsend.com/view/wc4cackddrbfe35h).\n  * As such, as part of the ADPC, we commit to continually align with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits cleanly into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).\n  * Executing on ad-hoc tasks such as aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.\n\n### **Optional Additional Verticals: Procurement for Up to \\[2] Additional Verticals Depending on the Completion of Work Package 1**\n\n**Scope of Optional Additional Verticals**\n\nOn completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to \\[2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval and approved by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks.\u00a0\n\nWe are leaving some flexibility in this Work Package given the pace of change in the DAO and the broader crypto market, and recognize that the DAO\u2019s needs and wants will likely change over time.\u00a0\n\n**Note:** This work package will likely be subject to the ADPC requiring additional funding since this Phase II proposal is based on conducting procurement for two verticals. If the need for additional funding to conduct procurement for these further verticalsarises, the ADPC will approach the DAO with further details about budget and scope.\n\n# **VI. Budget & Methodology**\n\n### **Budget Components**\n\n**Phase II Budget**\n\nAs outlined in the [<u>Phase I Outcome Report </u>](https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as)and the section on [<u>Key Learnings & Improvements</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) from Phase I above, the actual work in the ADPC was significantly more time intensive than priced-in, but taken on by the committee as goodwill in the pilot phase. Since we have now left the pilot phase and will provide procurement services for two verticals in Work Package 1, the budget naturally reflects this.\n\n**The ADPC is budgeting USD 360,000 for the work in Phase II as outlined in the Phase II Mandate section above.**\n\nIn Phase II, the ADPC will continue with producing the agreed outputs together with a continuation of management of all legacy programs including the management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Service Providers.\n\n**Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services \\[Work Package 2]**\n\nRegarding the Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services \\[Work Package 2], given the operational effort to set up and run such a fund, as described in Work Package 2 above, we would usually charge a management fee including Operational Expenses as a percentage fee of the value of the fund.\u00a0\n\nIn this case, however, given that this is the pilot phase for the fund and that all the pre-work to set the fund up including the passing of the Tally vote and liaising with the Arbitrum Foundation has already been completed, we will waive all fees to run the fund in the pilot phase as a sign of our commitment and in order to make it as seamless as possible to prove the success of the fund in this first iteration.\n\nThis fee waiver only applies to the current proposal. If there is an extension to the Subsidy Fund in the future, management fees will be included in the respective proposal.\n\n**Operational Expenses Budget**\n\nPhase I highlighted the importance of including operational expenses in the budget: This is necessary to engage external subject matter experts - as we did with [<u>DeDaub in Phase I</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adding-a-security-sme-to-the-adpc/23526)\u00a0 - and cover operational expenses such as third party communication tools and collaboration infrastructure.\n\nTo take this into account, we propose an additional budget of 15% Operational Expenses which will be allocated for the engagement of SMEs and for other operational expenses and running costs. The Operational Expenses budget includes (non-exhaustive):\n\n* Infrastructure set-up for essential tools and infrastructure like centralized accounts for email, collaboration platforms, and document management systems;\n* Implementing comprehensive document retention and IP management policies;\n* Creating standardized templates and workflows for common processes;\n* Allocation of budget for specialized external SMEs to address complex issues efficiently;\n* Budget flexibility to accommodate unexpected challenges and community engagement needs.\n\nThe remaining unused funds of this sub-budget will be returned to Arbitrum\u2019s treasury after Phase II has been concluded.\n\n**The Operational Expenses Budget for Phase II will total USD 54,000.**\n\n**ARB Token Calculation**\n\nTo determine the ARB token amount, we used the 14-day Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of ARB/USD, each as listed EOD UTC, until EOD on Thu Sep 19 on CoinGecko ([<u>https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum/historical\\_data</u>](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum/historical_data)), prior to the proposal being posted on Tally. This method ensures a fair and current valuation while mitigating short-term price volatility. We'll add a 20% buffer to this amount to account for potential price fluctuations between proposal submission and execution. The remaining unused funds of this buffer will be returned to Arbitrum\u2019s treasury after the conversion has been concluded.\n\n### **Total Budget**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/4a89fd32-67ef-4286-a857-9c946ad16b25_original.png)\n\nThe total budget requested is 954,608 ARB. Please find the Google sheet with the corresponding calculation of the TWAP ARB Amount [<u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bwv3ljCRbZfQFJHeam_HaE5bSu1d-wIGyv0YUj2b7RA/edit?gid=0#gid=0).\n\nA detailed breakdown of the budget can be found in the Google sheet [<u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqsCoVu8ykQ3QOr1IMPiMG1lhP-qHYGnXl_OqOP3eBQ/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n# **VII. Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II**\n\n### **Methodology**\n\nIn order to identify the verticals that will be most beneficial for the ADPC to tackle in Phase II, we created a non-weighted scoring system to rate all verticals against the following factors:\n\n**Importance to Projects on Arbitrum**\n\nThis factor takes into account the importance of the vertical with respect to the following criteria:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n* Frequency of use of the vertical by Projects;\u00a0\u00a0\n* Estimated spend under the vertical;\u00a0\n* Feedback from Arbitrum stakeholders regarding importance of vertical to Arbitrum ecosystem growth; and\u00a0\n* The extent to which the Procurement Framework (PF) vertical helps make the process of building on Arbitrum, both for existing and new projects, more streamlined, cost-effective, and attractive, while simplifying and standardizing their engagement with service providers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHigher ratings indicate higher levels of importance.\n\n**Importance to DAO Proposals & Initiatives**\n\nThe extent to which the PF solves issues faced by existing DAO proposals and initiatives, helps operationalize them, and increases their chances of success. Higher ratings indicate higher levels of importance.\n\n**Solving Existing DAO Needs**\n\nThe extent to which the PF solves issues faced by the DAO in general, and how significantly the PF will help professionalize and operationalize the DAO further. Higher ratings indicate higher levels of utility to the DAO.\n\n**Overlap with Existing DAO Initiatives / Structure**\n\nThere are initiatives in the DAO or from the Foundation that are already tackling the problem solved by the PF. The ranking will take into account how well the PF vertical avoids overlap/duplication. Higher scores indicate PF is better at avoiding overlap/duplication.\n\n**Procurement Complexity / Cost**\n\nThe complexity of constructing the procurement framework and the cost to do so. Higher ratings indicate lower complexity.\n\n**Monetary Savings for Projects on Arbitrum**\n\nThis criterion evaluates cost savings for projects on Arbitrum resulting from an implementation of the respective PF. Higher ratings indicate greater cost savings.\n\n**Monetary Savings for DAO**\n\nThis criterion evaluates cost savings for the DAO resulting from an implementation of the respective PF. Higher ratings indicate greater cost savings.\n\n**Increase in Deployment Efficiency**\n\nThis criterion evaluates the extent to which an introduction of the PF makes deployment for new projects more efficient.\u00a0 The greater the efficiency improvements, the higher the rating.\n\nEach of these factors are rated on a scale of 0 (Not Applicable at All), 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), 3 (High), and higher scores are better.\n\n**Note:** Some of these factors are not applicable to some verticals. As such, the final score for each vertical is the percentage it has achieved, to enable comparability between verticals. For example, if the Events vertical has 6 factors that are applicable to it, the maximum score it can achieve is 18 and its final score is the percentage of the score it has achieved out of 18, so if it has achieved 17, its final score is 94%.\n\n**Application of Methodology to Frameworks**\n\nWe identified 27 verticals that we could potentially tackle in Phase II. The below table represents the scores per vertical with the methodology applied, in order from highest to lowest. For a detailed breakdown of the application of the methodology with rationales for each individual score, please see the table [<u>here</u>](https://adpc.notion.site/Application-of-Procurement-Framework-Shortlisting-Methodology-0c35048ce6074195b64afb07277a7887).\n\nThe verticals we selected to obtain further feedback on from high-context delegates, existing projects on Arbitrum, and new projects looking to build on Arbitrum, were those with scores >80% and constitute the below verticals:\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/02a80294-c049-43b9-aace-e9c02b4283f8_original.png)\n\nThe verticals we selected to obtain further feedback on from high-context delegates, existing projects on Arbitrum, and new projects looking to build on Arbitrum, were those with scores >80% and constitute the below verticals:\n\n1\\. Events\n\n2\\. Tokenomics & Token Launch Teams\n\n3\\. DevRel Firms\n\n4\\. OTC Services\n\n5\\. KYC Providers\n\n7\\. RPC Providers\n\n**Note:**\n\nWe did not initially include Risk Service Providers in the list of verticals since these were already available to the DAO via the ARDC. As such, we did not ask for specific feedback from delegates and stakeholders for this vertical.\n\nHowever, given that the ARDC may eliminate this function in its next iteration, we decided to include it in our list and, as it scored very highly, include it in the list of verticals to potentially tackle in Phase II.\n\n**Community Engagement & Feedback Collection**\n\nAfter shortlisting the top six verticals, we decided to validate the shortlisted verticals with high-context delegates, existing Arbitrum projects, and new projects aiming to build on Arbitrum. The intention was to further narrow down the verticals to the two we would tackle in Phase II.\n\n**We reached out to 25 stakeholders for feedback:** L2Beat, Coinflip, GMX, DK, Gauntlet, Wintermute, Griff Green, Blockworks, Frisson, JoJo, Jones DAO, Pepperoni Jo3, Treasure, Camelot, Cattin, Premia, MUX Protocol, MaxLomu, Bob Rossi, Karpatkey, Princeton Blockchain Club, Bobbay, Angle Protocol, Merkl, and PaperImperium.\u00a0\n\nBased on our interactions with the community, we decided to move forward with the procurement of RPC providers as the first vertical. This is because RPC costs are high, RPCs are critical for projects to deploy, similar to security audits, and technical due diligence around infrastructure providers is a complex task that drains time and resources from projects. As such, creating a panel of whitelisted RPC providers streamlines the building process for projects.\n\nIn addition, we locked in 'Events' as a second vertical. The reason for this is that we spoke with Entropy Advisors about the need for a coherent events strategy for Arbitrum DAO, which is also apparent from the multiple concurrent events proposals being proposed in the DAO. As a result, we decided to create a proposal alongside Entropy Advisors and DisruptionJoe to establish a DAO Events Strategy for 2025, which will be published soon. While the proposal on the DAO Events Strategy for 2025 is focused on defining in particular the type and distribution of events as a first step, event services and event providers have to be procured in a second step to execute on the identified strategy. This second step, i.e., the provision of those procurement services for the identified events, is the subject of this proposal.\n\n# **VIII. Transparency & Community Engagement**\n\nAs in Phase I, the ADPC commits to maintaining its high standards of transparency and community engagement. We will:\n\n* Continue to hold bi-weekly calls with the entire Arbitrum community, and when need be, make this more frequent;\n* Continue to update the [<u>ADPC Update Thread</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adpc-update-thread/23361/17) on the forum;\n* Post all meeting minutes and tasks on the [<u>ADPC\u2019s public dashboard</u>](https://www.notion.so/Public-Dashboard-a1d953a54c7949c38d9882792f90a7a0?pvs=21), with a view to further enhancing the dashboard to provide even more information to the community.\n\n# **IX. Checks & Balances**\n\nKindly note that Phase II of the ADPC\u2019s term will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the [<u>Procurement Committee proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064), regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:\n\n* **Conflict of Interest Provision:** ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members\u2019 involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n* **Record-keeping and Reporting:** Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC\u2019s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.\n* **Duty of Impartiality:** ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n* **Obligation of Recusal:** ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation & administration of the applicable procurement process.\n* **Prohibition of Self-Dealing:** Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n* **Ethical Trading:** Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n# **X. Multi-Sig**\n\nWe propose to use the [<u>Multi-Sig Support Service</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836) for Arbitrum DAO. Accordingly, we have taken advantage of the cost savings associated with that service and not included any costs for multi-sig management in this proposal.\n\n# **XI. ARB Conversion Strategy**\n\nThe ADPC will utilize a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Aera to convert the program\u2019s ARB into USDC for operational purposes. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilizes off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ADPC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modeling and executed on Odos, or Bebop. Based on current market conditions, it would take approximately one week to trade out of 414K USD worth of ARB with minimal impact.\u00a0\n\n<img height=\"224\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcQxe5D3NtHl5v6Wou02HlHACIwotU2tGTArqxNZuGkWbR8uUVIxbAQ-yXSUosrPR1yM7c_vySCWpKw9fNpoOa_es889iABvcjDIR7bDCZy6uGkryUxRxhT3z_ezACJRq7b93HDA_Wd_dvwGQNJeg?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\n**Protocol-Owned Execution**\n\nThe Protocol-Owned Execution strategy uses off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity, model price impact, and plan the execution of active and passive trading. Based on current market conditions, it will take \\< 1 week to swap out of 414k USD worth of ARB with minimal impact.\n\nFor ARB on the Arbitrum Chain, Gauntlet will swap out tokens using either Odos (DEX aggregator) or BeBop (self-execution solver).\u00a0\n\nPassive execution uses concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC pool (Odos supports projects such as Camelot, Uniswap V3, and [<u>more</u>](https://www.odos.xyz/about)). The amount converted through this position is periodically claimed, and a new ARB position is set in the pool. These can be thought of as limit orders.\n\n<img height=\"136\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdKC1Yctsz4n_8hLKl-wNVswcDK9GYigoLIlARP8UpLN-J3y62mwBX1hO0GKANfJg9-nmRuoU_BeiDoBtAUqv7rVO5V4fCppLp8rHS0J7DhZBjSms7o1L5kbGzt5AaBY-9Hq1jbrpaI8m44sNw_dg?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\nActive and passive execution are used in tandem to maximize liquidity sourcing. Price impact modeling and gas cost determine the intraday trading schedule and size. Historical data is used to determine initial parameters. We continuously monitor slippage, intraday price impact, and medium-term price impact and adjust execution parameters if necessary.\n\nIntraday price impact is measured as the likelihood of observable price divergence in the hour after trading. The medium-term impact is measured as the effect of trade size on the divergence relative to a peer benchmark.\n\n<img height=\"444\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXebyP8Y0LelurvdX7559Y_lsZqAnZg_565TKi3V1iHy4TIeQuPPqURp6T5Loep2wPouHfhTYulL9dmhhutDrK-3f9amiQiDVBZNTmhVA60EpYhQ9DNPJWnETdNZhy1z6BfcuhEutie9KH19RxJAyw?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\n*The example chart shows rolling slippage for one of Aera\u2019s Trade Execution Customers*.\n\n<img height=\"419\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeFOAHkefe0TGds3Ku642E3FP5jJCHgwcKvnPeKZs1SRZ9l8sUsEF_ofR0AqIimpxCXH-k54FpG1-c49tF0Tw1mT2SfCeK2PmrecejJYEBjiqE42TTLye_LAVepSVTW2uvUngNXlNPqv91_oEftAA?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\n*The example chart shows the likelihood of intraday impact for one of Aera\u2019s Trade Execution Customers.*\n\n**ADPC Vault Parameters**\n\n**ADPC Vault Parameters**\n\n* Chain: Arbitrum\n* Vault Owner: MSS (arb1:0x13d4Ff2A83fBCB8F5fc73cE66CF5928eD0943cB0)\n* Guardian: Gauntlet\n* Tokens: ARB, USDC\n* Protocols: Odos, Bebop, Llamapay\n* Strategy: Swap ARB for USDC; minimizing market impact\n* Payment Stream: streamed continuously over 6 months once the swap from ARB to USDC is complete\n* Fee: 0%\n\n### **ADPC Members Payment Process**\n\nOnce the ARB is converted into USDC, the Aera vault will utilize LlamaPay to stream the total payment due to the ADPC member wallet addresses over the course of the 6-month period (120k USDC per member, 360k USDC in total). The remainder of the converted funds (54k USDC) will remain in the MSS as the OpEx budget. This process will be coordinated with the MSS chairs and members.\n\n### **About Aera**\n\nAera is an on-chain solution to optimize DAO funds autonomously. It addresses the common pain point of inactive treasury management, which often hinders a DAO\u2019s ability to maintain its runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from market growth. Unlike traditional institutions that rely on agile managers for fund allocation, DAOs face unique challenges, including governance and incentive alignment with external managers.\n\nTo address these, Aera offers a unified solution for efficiently and transparently managing on-chain treasuries, grants, and incentive funds through customizable vaults. Aera vaults can hold stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies, with their objective functions tailored to each DAO\u2019s needs. Guardians leverage off-chain logic to automate rebalancing decisions, ensuring the vaults meet their objectives across various market scenarios and time horizons.\n\nYou can read more about Aera [<u>here</u>](https://docs.aera.finance/)."

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Remove Cost Cap, Update Executors, Disable Legacy USDT Bridge\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP combines and puts forward three separate proposals for the ArbitrumDAO to consider: [<u>Remove Cost Cap on Arbitrum Nova</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xeb044e3bdeba71e74dea02abeab4c33fe4bf5ab9def50082863702d5e2112b93), [<u>Update the Upgrade Executors</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc08147e229fa642ee7da2e5180f225122b8c517024902f21cdcd02b376179b8d), and [<u>Disable Legacy Tether Bridge</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd5a66f784523841511f7ffec4171b9c14404fdbf7c205086312084d19c95c193). All of the aforementioned proposals have previously passed a Snapshot vote, reaching a quorum of 3% votable $ARB.\u00a0\n\nThe first proposal will remove the Amortized Cost Cap, which is expected to result in higher gas fees for users on Arbitrum Nova. This increase is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the network and reduce the financial burden on the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nThe second proposal will replace the Upgrade Executor contracts on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum mainnet with upgraded versions. The modernized version introduces an additional function that enables the Upgrade Executor to execute an upgrade by directly calling the target contract, rather than indirectly delegate calling an upgrade contract.\n\nThe third proposal seeks to disable the legacy USDT bridge for Arbitrum One, given the activation of the new [<u>USDT0 bridge</u>](https://mirror.xyz/tetherzero.eth/_6FNgGi0WHHQhA9qavZ4rlt-nV9ehVuJUHxQnSwOmbM) in January 2025. This proposal seeks to disable the legacy bridge entirely, rather than continue with the current configuration, which subjects depositors to a week-long delay and risks loss of funds if the depositor is a smart contract.\n\n# **Motivation & Rationale**\n\n## Remove Cost Cap on Nova\n\nArbitrum Nova was initially positioned as a cost-efficient alternative to Arbitrum One, offering 30-50x cheaper transaction fees at launch. However, several developments have significantly reduced Nova\u2019s competitive advantage:\n\n* EIP-4844 blobs: The introduction of EIP-4844 significantly reduced the cost difference between Nova and Arbitrum One, from 30-50x to a mere 2x. This difference is negligible given the already low costs on Arbitrum One.\n* Orbit adoption: Orbit chains have become a more attractive option for teams seeking gas sponsorship and customization. Their ease of deployment has led many teams to prefer Orbit chains over Nova.\n\nGiven the now-minimal cost advantage over Arbitrum One and the rise of Orbit chains, maintaining an amortized cost cap on Nova \u2014 which currently prevents batch posters from recovering full L1 costs \u2014 is no longer justifiable. Removing the cap will stop the Arbitrum Foundation from providing subsidies and align cost recovery with actual usage.\n\nAccordingly, removing the cap (i.e., setting it to 0 bips) would:\n\n* Ensure batch posters are able to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n* Eliminate recurring deficits currently paid by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* Reflect Nova\u2019s lower strategic priority within the broader Arbitrum roadmap.\n\nHistorical data on Arbitrum Nova batch poster deficits can be seen [<u>here</u>](https://app.hex.tech/8bb08a30-5c58-48c4-acb0-5a0515db9db2/app/Public-Arbitrum-Nova-Economics-02zr64hC21SVqt2HSQjRLk/latest). \u200bThis data highlights the ongoing inefficiencies and justifies the removal of the amortized cost cap.\n\n## Update the Upgrade Executors\n\nThe Upgrade Executors controlled by the DAO are responsible for carrying out critical upgrades on [<u>Arbitrum One</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#code), [<u>Arbitrum Nova</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482), and [<u>Ethereum</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#code) such as protocol contract upgrades, system parameter changes, and more. Currently, the traditional Upgrade Executor contracts in place only support one function for executing an upgrade: [<u>execute()</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#writeProxyContract#F1). When called by the owner of the Upgrade Executor, the execute() function will perform a delegate call to an upgrade contract, which facilitates subsequent calls to target contracts and ultimately executes the upgrade. This indirect method of calling and execution can complicate upgrades and require additional development and deployments.\n\nThe modern version of the Upgrade Executor introduces a new function, [<u>executeCall()</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/eaa9d607464abb8683a3fe526acbf6d877f924e0/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol#L73), which allows the Upgrade Executor to directly call target contracts and execute upgrades, removing the need for delegate calls to upgrade contracts. While the existing execute() call is still supported, the new executeCall() function enables the Upgrade Executor to implement upgrades in a lighter weight fashion. In the future, upgrades that use this method may not require dedicated action contracts, simplifying the process and saving development energy.\n\n## Disable Legacy Tether Bridge\n\nHistorically, the existing USDT bridge for Arbitrum One was the primary path for bridging Tether to and from Arbitrum One. The new [<u>USDT0 standard</u>](https://mirror.xyz/tetherzero.eth/_6FNgGi0WHHQhA9qavZ4rlt-nV9ehVuJUHxQnSwOmbM) introduced a modernized alternative that has become the go-to solution. However, the legacy USDT bridge is still technically enabled, which presents several issues.\n\nFirst, withdrawals from the legacy bridge to L1 are subject to a seven-day delay, which is meaningfully slower than the new USDT0 bridge which can process bridge transactions in seconds or minutes. Also, once this delay has elapsed, deposits are auto-withdrawn on L1. This inconvenience can be addressed by disabling the legacy bridge and directing users exclusively to the new USDT0 bridge.\n\nSecond, user funds could be lost if a smart contract deposits to the legacy bridge on their behalf. The legacy bridge is currently configured to auto-withdraw funds as soon as possible back to the depositor; however, this auto-withdraw configuration can cause problems for smart contracts that deposit on behalf of end users but do not have withdrawal or refund functionality. While it\u2019s possible to recover funds in this scenario, it is certainly sub-optimal for smart contract operators and end users that delegate to them. Disabling the legacy bridge prevents smart contracts from encountering this issue and putting funds at risk. Also, once the legacy bridge is disabled, any transaction submitted to it will simply revert; this applies to third party integrations as well as direct user interactions.\n\n# **Key Terms**\n\n## Remove Cost Cap on Nova\n\n* **Amortized Cost Cap (setAmortizedCostCapBips)**: A parameter within the ArbOwner system contract that limits the percentage of Layer 1 transaction posting costs that batch posters are allowed to recover from the network. Expressed in basis points (bips), where 10000 = 100%.\n* **ArbOwner Contract**: A privileged precompiled contract that allows the ArbitrumDAO to configure core protocol settings, such as the amortized cost cap.\n* **EIP-4844**: An Ethereum Improvement Proposal introducing blob-carrying transactions. Its implementation has significantly reduced the cost disparity between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One, undermining the original economic rationale for Nova\u2019s fee model.\n* **Batch poster transactions**: Transactions that aggregate multiple operations and submit them as a single on-chain transaction. With the enforced fee cap, these transactions become less cost-effective under current network dynamics, contributing to operational inefficiencies.\n\n## Update the Upgrade Executors\n\n* **Upgrade Executor**: A smart contract responsible for executing upgrades on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum mainnet; owned and administered by the DAO\n* **Upgrade Contract**: A smart contract that contains dedicated logic for a particular upgrade; receives a call from the Upgrade Executor and subsequently calls other contracts targeted in that upgrade\n* **execute()**: The sole function for executing an upgrade in existing Upgrade Executor implementations; relies on indirect delegate calls to upgrade contracts\n* **executeCall()**: A [<u>new function</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/eaa9d607464abb8683a3fe526acbf6d877f924e0/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol#L73) for executing an upgrade in the modern Upgrade Executor implementation; allows for direct calls to target contracts. A new [<u>audit report</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/assets/files/2025-07-offchainlabs-upgrade-executor-report-900fbe3a31c6ca81e2949355f6134d33.pdf) was recently completed. Trail of Bits reviewed the implementation of executeCall, assessed it against the proposal\u2019s intent, and checked for unintended side effects. Trail of Bits found no security-relevant issues.\u00a0\n\n## Disable Legacy Tether Bridge\n\n* **USDT0**: Tether\u2019s new OFT-based version of USDT; more details here\n* DisableGatewayAction: A smart contract action that disables a gateway for a specified token from the [<u>L1GatewayRouter</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72ce9c846789fdb6fc1f34ac4ad25dd9ef7031ef#code); the DisableGatewayAction source code can be found [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/src/gov-action-contracts/token-bridge/DisableGatewayAction.sol)\n\n# **Specifications & Steps to Implement**\n\n## Remove Cost Cap on Nova\n\nThe DAO will execute a call to the [<u>ArbOwner contract</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/c32af127fe6a9124316abebbf756609649ede1f5/src/precompiles/ArbOwner.sol#L129C14-L129C37) on Arbitrum Nova to set the amortizedCostCapBips value to 0, thereby allowing batch posters to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n\n## Update the Upgrade Executors\n\n* Deploy the latest [<u>UpgradeExecutor</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/main/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol) contract on each network\n* Update proxy contracts on each network to reflect new UpgradeExecutor addresses:\n  * Arbitrum One: [<u>0xCF57572261c7c2BCF21ffD220ea7d1a27D40A827</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#code)\n    * [<u>upgradeTo</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n  * Arbitrum Nova: [<u>0x86a02dD71363c440b21F4c0E5B2Ad01Ffe1A7482</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482)\n    * [<u>upgradeTo</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n  * Ethereum: [<u>0x3ffFbAdAF827559da092217e474760E2b2c3CeDd</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#code)\n    * [<u>upgradeTo</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n\n1.

    "description": "# Request for Continuation of the Arbitrum DDA Program Request\n## **Summary**\n\nAs we near the end of allocating the initial grant budget (link to proposal), where through the\u00a0[Arbitrum Grants Program\u00a014](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/)\u00a0run via the Delegated Domain Allocation model by Questbook, $912k has already been allocated to over 60 proposals. Based on the overwhelming response and number of quality proposals the grant program has received, we propose to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters. We have received great feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators for requesting additional budget and continue funding projects through the delegated domain allocation model.\n\n## **Background and Progress**\n\n[The Arbitrum grants\u00a014](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/), administered via DDA by Questbook and 4 domain allocators, (Cattin, Adam, Juandi and JoJo) went live on the 5th of October with a total\u00a0[grants budget of $800k\u00a06](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook-arbitrum-dao-grants/14688)\u00a0spread across four domains. Since the launch of the grants program, the Arbitrum domain allocators approved proposals requesting $912k and disbursed a total of ~$394,000 to accepted proposals from a pool of 201 proposals. These domain allocators\u00a0[**were elected from the community and by the community.\u00a03**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-dao-grants-domain-allocator-nominations/15759/72)\u00a0The specific information regarding the accepted proposals and the funded teams can be found\u00a0[here\u00a014](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/).\n\nAs previously stated in our initial proposal, Questbook launched the grants program to further scale it based on proposal volume and learnings from the first ever grants program in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. The Arbitrum Grants run through DDA has received overwhelming response, receiving over 200+ proposals since launch.\n\nPlease find below the Arbitrum DDA Grant Programs funding breakdown of relevant metrics and insights and proposed improvements going forward.\n\n## Program Overview\n\n* Total Proposals: 201\n* Total Proposals approved: 60\n* Proposals by domain\n  * [Gaming\u00a03](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xbf93fc6825b5e9ba9a3d7fcf3d14cdfcf3b4c734\\&chainId=10\\&role=admin\\&proposalId=0x4a1): 51\n  * [New Protocol Ideas:\u00a02](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6\\&chainId=10\\&role=admin\\&proposalId=0x500)\u00a057\n  * [Dev Tooling:\u00a03](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x706bc8efecb6002f00a052fe5688d0eb89ea45f4\\&chainId=10\\&role=admin\\&proposalId=0x503)\u00a042\n  * [Education, Community and events:\u00a04](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x650b4a0dc2aec18f55adb72f13c5d95631db04be\\&chainId=10\\&role=admin\\&proposalId=0x472)\u00a051\n* Approved Proposals by domain (81/193 milestones completed)\n  * Gaming: 16\n    * 18/44 Milestones Complete\n  * New Protocol Ideas: 15\n    * 8/49 Milestones Complete\n  * Dev Tooling: 12\n    * 17/38 Milestones Complete\n  * Education, Community and events: 15\n    * 38/62 Milestones Complete\n* Grant Amounts committed by domain ($) - $912k allocated , 394k Paid out\n  * Gaming: 249K\n    * 107k Paid out\n  * New Protocol Ideas: 264k\n    * 65k Paid out\n  * Dev Tooling: 166k\n    * 84k Paid out\n  * Education, Community and events: 234k\n    * 138k Paid out\n\n### **Overview of Accepted and Funded Proposals with DA Report**\n\n**New Protocol Ideas Domain**\n\n1.

The Price fluctuations of the Arb tokens in the program were of concern for the program, as the overall budget which was denominated in USD kept fluctuating through the term of the grant program. In order to avoid a price fluctuation like that, and based on the feedback received on the Questbook DDA program feedback call from the DAO and delegates, an option is to convert all the Arb received at the time of the proposal passing to Stable coins immediately, to avoid fluctuation.\n2. As many projects have not completed their milestones yet, and with the milestones not having a due date for completion, a problem we foresee is these funds if the projects do not complete them may be locked for ever, or for an indefinite amount of time. If the projects complete their proposals post the program time, there is no structure in place to have the DAs review them post completion and fund them, as the program would have ended by then. To avoid this, for the next program, fixed deadlines will be set for a grant, where either the proposal can be taken over by a seperate team, or the funds can be clawbacked and allocated to another proposal.\n3. Work hour restrictions for DAs was limiting their ability to maximise their impact on the program, as they were only allowed to deliver 60 hours of effort a month. Based on the program so far, we realise that a time restriction only inhibits the DA from their ability assess proposals and support them more deeply, and therefore are suggesting a fixed monthly pay for the work a DA and PM does instead of pay on an hourly basis.\n4. Some of the proposals or conversations projects had with Quesbtook could not be followed on with a funding due to the soft cap established on the program to start with. To tackle this issue, and with the Arbitrum foundation grant ranging from $50-250k, we believe the program should increase its cap to $50k to cover the gap and accept a wider number of proposals.\n5. While all feedbacks, changes and evaluation were timely reported in the Questbook platform, was nonetheless necessary for DA to engage with grantees through chatting systems like Telegram and Google meet. This has generated some questions from the community as a whole regarding inhomogeneous communications ways. We will address this by standardizing both the report frequency, the template used, and especially by setting up a shared discord between all domains. 1:1 calls between DAs and teams will still be needed.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from Arbitrum DDA program, we propose renewing the Program with a budget of $4M for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Arbitrum\u2019s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the same domains as the previous program:\n\nDomainDomain AllocatorProposed BudgetNew Protocol IdeasJojo$920,000GamingAdam$920,000Dev ToolingJuandi$920,000Education, Growth, Community and EventsCattin (Seed Latam)$920,000\n\n**RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domain**\n\n1.

Education, Growth, Community and Events -\u00a0[Link](https://www.notion.so/e8e86fbd9ee349beb0d9046607dae812?pvs=21)\n\n* We propose increasing the allocated grants budget for all domains equally to a higher budget based on the number of proposals received in the previous round.\n* Additionally, in the first round we set a soft cap of $25,000, and we propose increasing the cap to $50,000, with a few more steps for approving a grant that is larger than $25,000, requiring the involvement of two DAs to approve a proposal rather than just the specific domain allocator.\n* Considering the previous softcap being half of what is currently proposed, and that for an average of $220,000 for each domain the program was able to run for around 3.5 months before being maxed out, we project that providing 4X the amount of the previous iteration to each domain should allow the program to constantly allocate, at the same rate or even higher, for the full 6 months projected duration\n* The increased cap will allow the Questbook Program to keep covering the bootstrap belt of grant between $1,000 to $25,000 while, at the same time, be able to serve larger protocols that inherently might have larger needs.\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in the initial program, the renewed grants program will be run using\u00a0[**Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1**](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/). Each\u00a0*domain allocator*\u00a0will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community.\n\nWhile the program has produced, accordingly to preliminary conversation with protocols and delegates, good results, we want to address and integrate the feedbacks so far proposed and partially covered in the previous section, such as:\n\n* have better accountability for the increased soft cap\n* define a more robust and structured set of rules for applicants, in regards to providing a timeline for their project(s)\n* define a cost for the management and verification of milestones after the program is completed\n* define a plan to manage the volatility of funds being distributed by the DAO in ARB token.\n\nThe DA will evaluate all the proposals through the rubrics provided for each domain, with the following framework:\n\n* in case of request below or equal to $25,000, the evaluation process will be the same of the previous iteration, with rubrics being evaluated and scored by the specific DA\n* in case of request above $25,000, and below the new soft cap of $50,000, the evaluation will involve a second DA, chosen by the first one based on the proximity of the specific expertise and knowledge to that proposal, that will have to publish a second evaluation of the rubrics alongside the score. Assuming N rubrics, scored from 1 to 5, the grant will be approved only if both the DA will give each a scoring equal or above to N\\*3.\n\nThe disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject the application based on evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator. The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs.\n\nAfter the end of two quarters, the grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to eventually, renew the program and, if so, change any specification of the domains, the domain allocators or the program manager.\n\nTo ensure predictability of the funding of the program and a proper runaway, upon receiving the amount from the DAO, the DAs alongside the PM will convert it in stables. If the protocols request it, specific grants or milestones might be paid in $ARB by converting the needed amount at the moment of payout.\n\nArbitrum DDA program closed accepting new proposals from mid February. If the program will be renewed in the terms above, the DDA program will take care, alongside the evaluation of new proposal, to keep evaluating the milestones of the previous program, thus allowing for the continuity of the previous iteration in an accountable way for grantees.\n\n### Compensation\n\nSourcing, reviewing, funding, marketing, tracking and nurturing proposals requires\u00a0**significant expertise and time commitment**\u00a0from the grants committee members and they should be fairly and competitively compensated for their efforts. Based on the learnings from the previous program specified above, we believe that opting for a fixed payment structure over an hourly paid model may be more impactful for the program. DAs and PMs have months where the work goes above and beyond the work hours mentioned, which does not get compensated accordingly, and there are constraints to work hours and impact a DA can provide within the limited hours provided. This indeed also impacted the turnaround time, alongside some technical difficulties.\n\nWe propose the following payment structure for the PM and DAs, with a base salary of $100/h and an increased projected workload of DA by 33% compared to the previous program, in consideration of the fact that DA not only have on average worked more than what initially was expected in the previous program, but also that they will need to spend time to cross evaluate all proposals above $25,000. On the other hand, the compensation of the PM is instead unchanged.\n\nWe are also adding overhead for an extra 6 months, equivalent to 20% of full-time salaries, for the Domain Allocators and the PM to keep evaluating the milestones of the grantees after the natural end of the program. This will ensure the proper continuation of the program and the followup with grantees, despite the program potentially not being renewed if so decided by the DAO. In case the program would be renewed with the same structure and people, or in case the milestone verification would come to an end before the due time, any leftover would be given back to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nRoleMonthly CostTotalProgram Manager and Questbook$10000$60,000\\*Domain Allocator$8000$192,000Overhead for extra 6 months$8400$50,400Operations Cost, Misc.$10,000Totals:$312,400\n\n* Note: Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool at a cost of $5000 per month, included in the numbers above with the PM\u2019s payment.\n\nAs per the above, the current costs to run program would be 7.8% of the overall budget of the grant program.\n\n* We suggest that the grants committee continue with\u00a0[Synapse\u00a01](https://www.synaps.io/)\u00a0for KYC services and\u00a0[Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/en-in)\u00a0for all contractual agreements, as we have been using these services throughout the Arbitrum DDA program 1.\n* However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant proposal from Arbitrum at the end of two quarters.\n\n### KPIs and Expectations\n\n**Program Success**\n\n* Increase in the number of contributors, proposals, and funded projects\n* Increase in milestone and proposal completion rates\n* Increase in NPS score from all proposers and grantees\n* Lower response turn around time to delegates\u2019 and community\u2019s queries\n* Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community members to review the proposals across different domains during community calls regularly\n* Timely publishing of comprehensive monthly grants report, outlining the status, progress, and impact of the program, ensuring transparency and accountability\n\n**Enhanced Community Involvement**\n\n* Increase in community engagement across :\n  * Discourse\n  * Discord, Telegram\n  * Social media (Twitter, Reddit)\n* Increase in the community members\u2019 participation to keep domain allocators and program manager accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n\n**Brand Awareness**\n\n* Strengthened contributors\u2019 sentiment and word of mouth towards Arbitrum measured through frequent sentiment surveys/ polls to gauge satisfaction\n* Enhanced Arbitrum\u2019s brand recognition and awareness within contributor circles through surveys or social media analytics, tracking mentions, reach etc.\n\n**Contribution of Funded Projects to Arbitrum**\n\n* Number of users onboarded by the funded proposals onto their app/protocol\n* TVL (if applicable) of the selected proposals\n* Number of new interfaces for supplying / borrowing / governance interactions\n* Number of projects that have raised follow on capital after getting a grant from Arbitrum Questbook program\n\n### **Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities**\n\n* All Domain Allocators and the Program Manager will continue to uphold their designated responsibilities as outlined in the Arbitrum DDA Program 1 proposal.\n* Domain allocators may request an audit for the considered/accepted proposals, particularly those that involve Solidity code being deployed into production and directly impacting Arbitrum with an high spending cap. In order to streamline the code auditing process and avoid potential time-consuming challenges, the domain allocators will provide assistance to the considered/accepted proposals by offering feedback on code quality and design.\n* As an addition to the previous iteration, projects will have to submit a proposed timeline for their project. The maximum time to complete the final milestone will be 1 year from the start of this iteration of the program (equivalent of 6 months after the natural end of it); after this date, all undistributed funds related to grant that did not complete their milestones will be given back to the Arbitrum DAO\n* The DAs, alongside the PM, will publish every 45 days in the Arbitrum governance forum a comprehensive report of the current status of the approved applications.\n* Every 2 weeks, the DAs will host a public office hour for protocols to come in and request information about any detail they might need to understand to apply to the grant program. This public call will also be used to provide general feedback on the ongoing program and will also let delegates and other stakeholders ask for information about it\n* Similar to the Arbitrum DDA program 1, the Program Manager will collaborate with the Arbitrum Foundation team and the elected domain allocators to\u00a0**create and list out necessary RFPs**\u00a0in order to ensure alignment with Arbitrum\u2019s priorities and roadmap.\n\n### **About Questbook**\n\n* Questbook (YC-W21) is a decentralized grant orchestration tool, currently being/previously used by Polygon, AAVE, Celo, Solana, TON, Aleph Zero etc.\n* Considering the achievements of Arbitrum DDA program, as well as the time commitment and operational expertise necessary for running an effective grants program, Questbook will continue in the role of the Program Manager. Srijith from Questbook will keep his role with the responsibilities of the Program Manager.\n\n### Method for converting Arb to Stablecoins\n\nIn the process of converting Arb tokens to stablecoins, we are requesting for 30% additional Arb in notional USD terms to make sure that there are $4M in the multisig in the end of the process due to any price actions, and whatever is extra, will be returned back to the DAO post the conversion.\n\nIn addition, if there is an important downturn in the value of Arb from the beginning of the Tally vote towards the end which affects the value received in USD terms significantly, we would potentially putup a second vote to re-fund the leftover USD needed as per the original $4M request.\n\nQuestbook will work with Aera, in collaboration with Gauntlet, thanks\u00a0[@Matt\\_Gauntlet](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_gauntlet)\u00a0for your help with this collaboration.\n\nThe following description is from the Aera team on the process of converting the Arb received to stablecoins.\n\nAs part of their engagement with the DAO, Questbook will be leveraging Aera to diversify out of the ARB tokens into USDC. Aera has engaged with the DAO previously to create a detailed report on treasury management. This report spoke in-depth about execution dynamics for ARB and specifically around the onchain impact of small and large ARB liquidations, particularly that there was outsized market impact relative to the size of liquidations from having grantees in individuals selling ARB themselves. Aera introduces a concept of Protocol Owned Execution (PoE), where the DAO would own the execution out of the governance token via Aera to achieve better execution on the whole.\n\nIn the context of the Questbook proposal, the flow for using Aera looks like the following:\n\n[image1664\u00d7608 85 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1d07eb28313bf4842dc100683a752d5fc3e19551.png)\n\n!<https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1d07eb28313bf4842dc100683a752d5fc3e19551_2_690x252.png>\n\nTo clarify how this works:\n\nQuestbook multisig will be the owner of the Aera vault. This gives only the Questbook Multisig the ability to withdraw and deposit from the vault at any time, as well as select which assets can be held, and which DeFi protocols can be interacted with.\n\nThe Guardian of the Aera Vault will be Gauntlet. Gauntlet acting as a guardian submits rebalance transactions against the vault to sell ARB for USDC.\n\nExecution will be done in batches to prevent a outsized price impact. Furthermore, Aera has the ability to conduct operations under specific slippage requirements, if desired.\n\nThe Aera vault has hooks in place that prevent >3% loss per day due to guardian interactions, and it disallows interaction with anything not previously approved by the Owner (Questbook Multisig).\n\nQuestbook is looking to generate $4M in USDC from selling ARB. One risk here is that price fluctuations in ARB bring the initial ARB allocation below the needed $4M USDC notional. While there is fundamentally no way to mitigate this entirely (From Mar 13th - 19th the price of ARB dropped >30%), it is possible to hedge this by asking for a sufficient buffer. Given historical drawdowns a 30% additional ARB buffer (in notional USD terms) should be sufficient.\n\nFor this proposal of converting the Arb to stablecoins, Aera will be using Bebop as the primary exchange and Uniswap as a fallback. Bebop is an onchain exchange that taps into a solver network. Bebop is critical for this proposal due to its ability to tap into offchain liquidity (which is much deeper than onchain liquidity). In concept, Bebop is similar to CoWSwap in how it taps into an offchain network of solvers. Uniswap will also be enabled as part of the Aera vault, and will be used in a fallback capacity. Uniswap has the deepest onchain liquidity for ARB on Arbitrum, and we will use it as a fallback should Bebop have worse execution.\n\nOne important question is why Bebop and Uniswap and not other aggregators or exchanges. In many ways Bebop is an aggregator already, solvers filling orders on Bebop can tap into whatever onchain or offchain liquidity sources they want in order to fill an order. As such Aera doesn\u2019t need to explicitly tap into alternative DEXes or Aggregators to fill orders."

    "description": "# Kwenta x Perennial: Arbitrum Onboarding Incentives\n# **Please** [**refer here**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/kwenta-x-perennial-arbitrum-onboarding-incentives-updated/22736) **for the full proposal description**\n\nKwenta, a prominent DeFi application in the Optimism ecosystem, is set to expand to Arbitrum, utilizing Perennial V2, an Arbitrum-native protocol. This joint proposal requests 1.9 million ARB to fund targeted onboarding incentives, aiming to bring Kwenta users to Arbitrum.\n\n* Full LITPP format\n* Ask of 1.9M ARB, down from 4.5M\n* Detailed onboarding incentives methodology & model: quest-style incentives, one targeting a broad base of users, one specifically scaling CAC to target the highest value users\n* Matt from Stable Lab & LTIPP multisig confirmed to handle accountability, in line with STIP.b requirements\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboard New Users to Kwenta on Arbitrum: Target existing Kwenta users from Optimism and Base, sidelined Kwenta community members eager to trade on Arbitrum, and new DeFi or centralized exchange (CEX) traders. The focus is on attracting a large number of users from other ecosystems.\n2. Retain High-Value Users: Encourage recurring usage from the highest value users from other ecosystems (power users), delivering significant value for Kwenta, Perennial, and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n3. Mutual Growth: Utilize the combined strengths of Kwenta and Perennial to attract a substantial number of new users to Arbitrum beyond the duration of the grant.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n\n* Flexible Distribution Methods: Utilize both on- and off-chain data, with off-chain rewards distribution for flexibility, adjusting methods based on effectiveness.\n* Kwenta\u2019s Frontend Application: Leverage Kwenta\u2019s active user base to serve direct incentives through customized notifications within the application, facilitating a higher conversion rate.\n* Seamless Migration Experience: Develop a top-tier user experience for migrating to Arbitrum, minimizing costs, clicks, and time required for users to switch chains.\n\nIncentive Model:\n\n1. Targeted Trader Onboarding Incentives:\n\n* Quest 1 (Mass Onboarding): Aim to onboard up to 2,200 users from the past year, offering a reward of up to $50 to cover migration costs and encourage initial trading on Arbitrum. Users must open at least two trades of at least $1,000 each to qualify for the reward.\n* Quest 2 (Active Trader Incentivisation & Retention): A 12-week quest targeting high-value users. Rewards are divided into tiers based on trading volume, with higher rewards for more active users. Weekly multipliers incentivize consistent trading, and users can opt to vest their rewards for higher future multipliers.\n\n1. Targeted Fee Rebates:\n\n* Allocation: 66.6% for existing Kwenta users and 33.3% for non-Kwenta Arbitrum users.\n* Structure: Rebates are pooled and capped at fees paid, preventing wash trading. Distributed weekly, with options for users to vest their rebates for higher future rewards.\n\n1. Liquidity Bootstrapping Incentives:\n\n* Initial Focus: Primarily on ETH and BTC markets, with expansion to other assets based on trader demand.\n* Approach: Incentives to attract efficient liquidity providers, reducing reliance on retail liquidity, aiming for professional market makers with higher leverage to ensure deep liquidity at lower costs.\n\nIncentive Mechanisms:\n\n* Upfront Onboarding Incentives: Help users overcome switching costs with initial rewards, aiming for conversion to recurring users.\n* Weekly Rewards and Loyalty Multipliers: Encourage users to return regularly and increase their rewards through consistent participation.\n* Tiered Rewards and Vesting Options: Provide higher rewards for increased usage and incentivize users to lock their ARB for additional benefits.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\n* Onboarding KPIs: Measure net-new volume and users onboarded.\n* General KPIs: Track trading volume, open interest (taker), total liquidity (maker), and total value locked (TVL).\n\nGrant Timeline and Milestones:\n\n* Month 1:\n  * Focus on onboarding new users.\n  * Target $10M average daily volume and 250 net-new users.\n* Month 2:\n  * Scale up growth in volume and open interest.\n  * Target $25M average daily volume and 400 net-new users.\n* Month 3:\n  * Retain growth and volume.\n  * Target $50M average daily volume and 500 net-new users.\n\nJustification for Grant:\n\n* Net-New Capital and Users: Kwenta aims to onboard hundreds of users and over a billion in monthly volume to the Arbitrum ecosystem, providing significant value compared to other incentive programs.\n* Arbitrum Perps Proliferation: Kwenta\u2019s perps aggregator will enhance the existing perp ecosystem on Arbitrum, fostering competition and efficiency.\n* Distribution for Innovation: Utilize Kwenta\u2019s user base to introduce Arbitrum-native innovations, such as NFT perps and power perps, directly to the market.\n\nAccountability Details:\n\n* Program Manager: Matt from Stable Labs.\n* Multisig Oversight: A 5-out-of-7 multisig team confirmed to handle funds and ensure accountability.\n* Transparency and Reporting: Regular bi-weekly updates, a final closeout report, and adherence to OpenBlock Labs\u2019 data requirements, ensuring detailed tracking and analysis of program metrics.\n\nCommitment to Arbitrum:\n\n* Alignment with Arbitrum Ecosystem: Kwenta and Perennial demonstrate strong commitment through actions such as launching the Kwenta token on Arbitrum, introducing Arbitrum-native products, and maintaining Arbitrum as the core of their ecosystem.\n* Further Actions: Kwenta plans additional initiatives to deepen its relationship with Arbitrum, including innovative product launches and ecosystem participation.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis proposal seeks a one-off grant due to its unique potential impact, aiming to onboard significant new capital and users to Arbitrum by leveraging Kwenta\u2019s existing user base and Perennial's infrastructure. The proposed incentive mechanisms and detailed execution strategy aim to maximize user onboarding and retention, ensuring long-term benefits for the Arbitrum ecosystem."

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router\n**Note**: This proposal has been corrected. More information [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-proposal-for-arbitrum-dao-to-register-the-sky-custom-gateway-contracts-in-the-router/28617/81?u=jose_stablelab \"here\").\n\n**Abstract**\u00a0SKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n**Motivation**\u00a0SKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings ([https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi/)). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings ([https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/)), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem\u2019s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won\u2019t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n**Rationale**\u00a0This proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n**Sky Custom Gateway**\u00a0The Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n**Key terms**\u00a0USDS \u2013 Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS \u2013 Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n**Specifications**\u00a0Current Status The Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at\u00a0[https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/))\n\nUSDS address on Ethereum -\u00a0[https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F)\u00a0sUSDS address on Ethereum -\u00a0[https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD)\u00a0Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum -\u00a0[https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e)\u00a0Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum -\u00a0[https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793)\u00a0Official USDS address on Arbitrum -\u00a0[https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b)\u00a0Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum -\u00a0[https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610)\u00a0The code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\u00a0[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity\\_MakerDAO\\_Arbitrum\\_Token\\_Bridge\\_audit.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf)\u00a0[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\u00a0[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora)\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

    "description": "# Catalyze Gaming Ecosystem Growth on Arbitrum\nThis proposal was completed after a successful [Snapshot 8](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a9f2097b0b5a0021628e9edb0e7c9bffae4fdbb104f9996463e40a3129c7718) temp check for the Arbitrum DAO to empower gaming with a three year, 200m ARB with the goal of powering the Arbitrum gaming ecosystem with the best studios and games in the web3 industry.\n\nThe temp check showcased the enthusiasm to support web3 gaming, but also revealed important questions to answer when launching an ambitious, multi-year plan requiring not only a strong team to run the program, but transparent, flexible collaboration between many stakeholders.\n\n# Introduction - Gaming Catalyst Program\n\nWhat changed: No changes\n\nThe Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) is designed to immediately expand awareness and adoption of Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus by builders and players in the Gaming community.\n\nArbitrum has emerged as a leader in the competitive network race through a dynamic formula of innovation, robust technology, organic builders, and a variety of short and long-term incentives.\n\nThe proliferation of DeFi on Arbitrum showcases how quickly a snowball effect can onboard builders, users, and ultimately value for the Arbitrum DAO and other stakeholders (i.e. Offchain Labs, Ethereum, etc.). The TAM for DEFI has surged to $50B and is projected to surge to over $120B by 2030 and Arbitrum is leading the way.\n\nWe believe that the same opportunity exists to attract the best builders that will in turn create sticky high quality games that bring and retain new users within Arbitrum. The gaming vertical has a $250B TAM today that is projected to grow to $500B+ by 2030. Though the \u201cweb 3 + games\u201d segment of today\u2019s game TAM is relatively small, it is poised to grow exponentially this decade.\n\nSeveral L1s and L2s see this opportunity (most notably Solana, Cardano, Opstack, Immutable, Optimism, to name a few) and are moving to claim the builders with grants and investments.\n\n# GCP Hypothesis\n\nWhat changed: Minor language updates\n\nArbitrum has had immense success in the decentralized finance vertical, but the branding of Arbitrum as a home for gamers and game builders is nascent. As a network, Arbitrum falls behind major competitors (Immutable X, Ronin, Solana, etc) across total games migrated, games launched, and total gamers.\n\n[This educational post ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-and-the-future-of-web3-gaming/21270)shares some of the pain points and metrics within the gaming ecosystem in regards to Arbitrum.\n\nThrough the Gaming Catalyst Program, we aim to establish a dedicated team and fund to provide technical and strategic support to the game industry. This dedicated team is key to attracting and retaining the best established and independent developers.\n\nWe will know we are succeeding when we achieve the following:\n\n## Rapidly Increase the number of Game Developers using Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus\n\nThe GCP aims to provide support and resources to developers interested in building on the Arbitrum network. This includes access to funding, mentorship by vetted experts, and other forms of assistance to expedite the development process and contribute to success in the market post-launch.\n\n## Strategic Allocation of Resources via Grants and Investments\n\nBy allocating resources strategically, the program can maximize its impact by focusing on proven publishers and developers as well as promising independent projects within gaming. This ensures that resources are used efficiently and effectively to foster the growth of high-quality games on Arbitrum.\n\n## Attracting and retaining Top Talent\n\nJust as DeFi projects have flocked to Arbitrum due to its innovative technology and incentives, the GCP aims to attract the best game developers in the industry. By offering support,incentives and game industry specific tools, Arbitrum can position itself as an attractive platform for game development, leading to a surge in high-quality gaming experiences on the network.\n\n## Expanding the Use Cases of Arbitrum\n\nWhile DeFi has been a major focus of Arbitrum\u2019s success so far, expanding into the gaming vertical opens up new opportunities and use cases for the network. By supporting game and gaming infrastructure development, Arbitrum can diversify its ecosystem and appeal to a broader range of users and developers, with results that include but are not limited to Orbit chain and Stylus adoption.\n\n## Facilitating the Development of Sticky, Quality Games\n\nThe ultimate goal of the GCP is to encourage the development of sticky, high-quality games that not only attract users but also retain them over the long term. A dedicated GCP Team and Council representing the interests of the DAO will serve as quality control mechanisms to make sure the best applicants receive the full support of the GCP.\n\n# Proposal Summary\n\nWhat changed: No changes\n\nWe are asking the DAO to earmark 200m ARB over a three year period to expand the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape.\n\nThe GCP is meant to serve as a catalyst, not a comprehensive program, with a focus around onboarding and supporting high quality builders. After the roll out of the GCP, the aim is to use its learnings to mature the organization into a longer-term gaming program with a comprehensive approach to game ecosystem growth.\n\nStrategically, we believe that attracting, retaining, and supporting builders with a dedicated team and an ongoing investment in game developers and the technical solutions they need will be a key differentiating factor vs other competitive networks. This commitment to gaming will lead to high quality game launches that will in turn attract large numbers of engaged gamers.\n\nPart of the fund will be utilized to co-invest into promising studios and games along with approved, Arbitrum-aligned publishers, with the belief that the business model, industry expertise, and track record of publishers will streamline the outreach, vetting, negotiation, onboarding, and support process for builders. The fund will also be available for all other game builders seeking to create games on Arbitrum.\n\n### Controls\n\nPublishers and developers will be subject to a robust set of checks and balances to ensure alignment with this proposal\u2019s goals and Arbitrum DAO\u2019s values:\n\n* A GCP Council of 5 individuals with deep gaming, venture experience, analytics / reporting, and/or DAO governance skills will be elected by the DAO and will be responsible for holding the Catalyst GCP Team accountable - with influence including general oversight, visibility of performance reviews for GCP team members, offering a channel for constructive feedback.\\*\\*\n* A GCP Team will be created with the support of the Arbitrum Foundation, and will collaborate with the GCP Council (which will serve as oversight):\n  * An investment committee of 3 individuals including 1 Council member will approve investments\n  * Funding for projects will be contingent on achieving milestones\n  * A quarterly transparency report will be created with summary data on GCP performance\n  * Funding of projects will include terms that are market competitive\n* Program Outcomes and KPIs\n\nWhat changed: Adjusted KPIs for year 1 and year 2 to account for infrastructure setup time\n\nThe Gaming Catalyst program has an overarching goal to bring in talented builders, and help the builders accelerate their games through the lifecycle stages.\n\nThe highest level metric we will be tracking is studio / builder onboarding into the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, there will be a variance in the realized outcome due to publisher applications, types of builders targeted, and variables from network competition.\n\nPrimary expected outcome:\n\nWithin the initial time frame of the program (3 years), the goal is to establish Arbitrum as a de facto leader for on-chain gaming. Specifically:\n\n* 400-600 applications\n* 100-200 net funded games\n* Win net migrations to Arbitrum vs other L2s\n* 50+ new Orbit launches\n\nThe GCP will take time to reach its full potential, and setting milestones vs maturity of the program is prudent:\n\nKPIYear 1Year 2Year 3Daily Active Users20,00050,000To be set by GCP TeamOrbit Launches520To be set by GCP TeamStudio Deals1020To be set by GCP Team\n\n*Most games will be in dev and not (yet) live in 2024*\n\nThe GCP team will set appropriate OKRs and KPIs internally to align with the goals and milestones listed above.\n\nAn additional outcome that the program aims to achieve is incremental movement through the gaming lifecycles illustrated by the Helika presentation on 2/2/24 [here (slide 15)](https://docsend.com/view/ktydpd3etn2iq2gv) during our open office hours.\n\n# Initiatives & Budgeting\n\nWhat changed: Formatting changes, combined sections for readability\n\nWe are asking the DAO for 200m ARB to develop the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape.\n\nThe funding will be allocated towards the following initiatives over the span of a three year period:\n\n## 1. Builder Onboarding & Growth (160m ARB)\n\nFocused on attracting and supporting the best game builders into Arbitrum - open to publishers, established studios, and independent builders.\n\nUse of Funds: This funding is proposed to be reserved for established publishers, game studios and independent builders on Arbitrum to help scale the DAO\u2019s ability to attract, secure, and accelerate talented teams on Arbitrum.\n\nThesis / Experiment: We are allocating a large majority of the budget to empower growth of publishers and studios on Arbitrum.\n\n### Build Grants (25m)\n\nGrants will primarily be used to empower teams that are aiming to accelerate early stage development on Arbitrum, or to incentivize user onboarding. Other grant uses may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nGuidelines & Details:\n\n* Teams may apply via the GCP Grants form\n* Grants have a maximum size of 500k ARB\n* Preference for user onboarding incentives or early stage development\n* The grants manager has final approval on grants\n  * Scorecards and details must be shared with the GCP Council\n* Proposed: early grants period until legal entity is formed for GCP\n  * Onboard interim grants allocator\n  * Interim council of 5 members votes on individual grants\n  * Maximum allocation of 10m ARB prior to GCP entity formation\n* Each grant must have specific milestones agreed upon before funding\n\n### Investments (135m)\n\nTeams seeking more than 500k ARB or additional funding for development beyond initial development must work with the GCP investment team to align on deal terms.\n\nPublishers may submit multi-game deals to the GCP for consideration - allowing them to be more efficient and create more strategic plans for their ecosystem. As a packaged proposal, publishers and the GCP team may collaborate to set milestones, funding, kpis, etc in aggregate form or by each game, allowing for more flexible launch, development, and operational capabilities.\n\nGuidelines & Details:\n\n* Builders or publishers must agree on a commercial agreement value share through tokens, equity, revenue share (post recoupment), or other pathways.\n  * Other considerations include active use of Orbit chains with significant sequencer revenue share as part of the default licensing structure\n* More detailed deal structure guidelines will be created by the GCP Team upon its formation\n* By the end of the program term, any unused ARB will be returned to the DAO\n\n## 2. Infrastructure Bounties (40m ARB)\n\nFocused on creating game specific tech needed to make Arbitrum the best choice for game builders. Deals will follow grant or investment classifications based on the same sizing requirements as the Builder Onboarding and Growth program.\n\n* Allocated by RFP or decided by the Council on a per proposal basis for any tooling and infrastructure needed to support gaming within Arbitrum (i.e. account abstraction solutions and gasless transactions for games, payment rails, web and game engine SDKs, data analytics and attribution, etc.)\n* Promote Orbit, Stylus, and other development and infrastructure growth on top of new Arbitrum technology releases\n\nUse of Funds: This will be allocated by RFP or per proposal for any tooling and infrastructure needed to further support gaming within Arbitrum (i.e. onboarding documentation, gaming-centric boilerplates for Arbitrum Orbit, game contract libraries built via Stylus, account abstraction and gasless transactions solutions, payment rails for games, web and game engine SDKs (Unity, Unreal, Godot), etc.)\n\nThesis / Experiment: Web3 gaming is still nascent and there exists key gaps for game builders to build games and bring them to market. By incentivizing development for such infrastructure projects and tools, or accelerating development of Stylus as an Arbitrum native framework, this will help set Arbitrum further ahead in the competitive network landscape.\n\nCurrent Gaps: A non-exhaustive list of gaps that currently exist within the Arbitrum ecosystem:\n\n* Custom gaming-centric implementations of Orbit chains\n* Mobile App Infrastructure with wallet that is optimized for games and asset management (See Ronin Wallet on mobile as an example)\n* Web and game engine SDKs (Unity, Unreal, Godot) that allow for in-game contract calls\n* Desktop launcher and distribution solutions\n* Game analytics, optimization, and related tooling (tying together on-chain, off-chain, social, and player activity)\n\nFunding Guidelines:\n\n* The GCP Team will establish initial RFPs and funding guidelines\n* An infrastructure specific rubric will be established by the Council to assess proposals\n* Independent proposals that do not fit within RFP guidelines are welcome to apply separately for GCP Team consideration\n* Any approved applicants for RFPs may be selected for vendor whitelisting, which allows vendors to be marketed to GCP participants\n* By the end of the program term, any unused ARB will be returned to the DAO\n\n# GCP Org Structure\n\nWhat changed: No changes\n\nWhen designing the organizational structure of the GCP, two major dynamics were considered:\n\n1. Enabling autonomy of the GCP team while setting safeguards for program success\n2. Empowering the DAO to have transparency and representation without impacting compliance, disclosure, and other necessities for a grants program with commercial ties within the gaming industry\n\n# <img height=\"317\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/32aa04e5451d1ed33e09b4a6dd9a51620cc5ba14.png\" />\n\n## Decision making process\n\n* Decision is made by GCP team\n  * Investment committee decision, staffing, etc\n* Council meetings every two weeks to discuss / veto any decisions\n* Decision is \u2018ratified\u2019 and activated\n* Every half year, aggregate summary of data as applicable shared in a report to DAO\n\n# GCP Team\n\nWhat changed: Added roles / responsibilities, section on entity setup, team incentives, and overall costing estimates.\n\nThe GCP Team will be the primary operator of the GCP program.\n\nTeam members may join the program through a few pathways:\n\n* Nomination through the proposal process (to help accelerate standup of the program)\n* Hiring by the GCP team, with veto capabilities held by the Council\n\nThe below team roles and responsibilities are illustrative of an initial proposed structure, but may change based on industry / program demands.\n\n## GCP Team Roles & Responsibilities\n\nThese roles are understood to be the MVP in order to stand up successful programming. The roles and titles may adjust based on needs. Any adjustment of budget will be reviewed with the council and put forth for the DAO to vote if needed.\n\n1.

Any expenditures above the $25m cap must be approved by the GCP council and may either be deducted from grant budgeting or increased through a DAO vote.\n\nPerformance against budget will be reviewed by GCP Council as part of the regular transparency reports.\n\nARB will be converted to USD or USDC by the Foundation before each quarter and sent to the GCP program account or multi-sig for disbursement.\n\n## Entity Setup and Model\n\nThe GCP working group and Arbitrum Foundation are actively exploring entity setup to ensure DAO transparency while following the rigorous compliance guidelines that surround any entity focused on investments.\n\nThis effort also involves DAO members from the M\\&A, Ops Co, VCDAO, and other initiatives.\n\n# GCP Council\n\nWhat changed: Additional requirements added\n\nThe GCP Council will be a DAO elected group of trusted professionals with backgrounds ranging across gaming, venture, grant allocation, web3 technology, and DAO relations. The group functions as a braintrust that offers their accumulated knowledge to empower the GCP Core Team.\n\nPrimary responsibilities of the GCP Council:\n\n* Collaborate with the GM and IC on deal proposals by providing insights and identifying potential risks (can challenge based on deals not meeting very clear requirements).\n* Offer recommendations on proposed deals after reviewing relevant data and analysis (this analysis would be a standard for all deal memos).\n* Escalate concerns regarding deals to designated oversight bodies if necessary.\n* Review and provide feedback on GCP team member nominations submitted by the GM and Program Director.\n* Advise the GM and Program Director on long-term strategic plans for GCP.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Council members must not be from

replace council members\n* Must sign NDAs and respect confidentiality agreements\n\n# Kickstarting the Team and Program\n\nWhat changed: New section\n\nTo facilitate the stand up of the overall GCP programming and start funding talented teams within a reasonable time frame, we propose the following phases.\n\n## Phase 1: Early Activation (1-2 months)\n\n* Focus/Goal: Establish core operational framework.\n* Activities:\n  * Finalize entity setup for legal compliance.\n  * Working Group selects two interim council members with relevant expertise (gaming, industry influence, venture capital, DAO governance).\n  * Working Group, in collaboration with the interim council, selects initial team members for critical roles (Program Director, Analyst).\n  * Develop and present a clear timeline for council elections and full team buildout.\n\n## Phase 2: Program Development (2-4 months)\n\n* Focus/Goal: Build operational infrastructure and initiate program activities & tactics.\n* Activities:\n  * DAO elects remaining three council members & votes to confirm/reject interim council members.\n  * Establish key program infrastructure: website, grant application process, communication channels.\n  * Issue first RFP for infrastructure development.\n  * Open grant applications for game developers and studios.\n  * Develop initial marketing, brand, and outreach strategy (this includes identifying agency partners if needed).\n  * Finalize onboarding process for funded projects (includes research and team/project leader interviews).\n  * Begin recruiting for additional team members based on a prioritized hiring plan (which will be clarified early phase two).\n\n## Phase 3: Program Acceleration (4-6 months)\n\n* Focus/Goal: Achieve momentum, establish presence, and scale funding activities.\n* Activities:\n  * Full GCP team is operational, with all key roles filled (may be additional roles to consider based on learnings from prior months).\n  * Grant applications reviewed, and first grants awarded to qualified projects.\n  * Infrastructure RFPs reviewed, and contracts awarded to selected vendors.\n  * Implement marketing and outreach strategy.\n  * First program transparency report issued outlining performance against KPIs to DAO, Council, etc. Adjust strategies as needed.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWhat changed: Adjusted based on current estimates on timeline.\n\n* \\[Done] Post Open Draft (Shared on 2/15/24, link within Arbitrum Gaming Education Post \\[[Arbitrum and the Future of Web3 Gaming

Operations.\n\nWe estimate the total cost to equal 200m ARB + operations costs detailed below under Program Administration & Operations.\n\nThis is a three-year program and forecasted amounts may change / require amendment(s) as the program evolves. Any unutilized ARB at the end of the program duration will be returned to the DAO treasury.\n\n* Total Incentives: 200m ARB\n  * Builder Onboarding and Growth: 160m ARB\n  * Infrastructure, Tooling & Stylus Development: 40m ARB\n* Program Administration & Operations - $25m\n  * Council Members (5): $600k\n    * 30k each member per year\n    * 80k for investment committee representative\n  * MultiSig Signers (5): $180k (the multi-sig holding the total sum will have signers from the Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain labs - these individuals will not be paid)\n  * Team Salaries: $18m\n  * Marketing and Infrastructure: $2m\n    * Includes website standup, conference spend, travel expenditure, and other costs\n  * Legal / Compliance: $3m\n    * Expecting usage for vendors, entity setup, adjustments for fast evolving regulatory environment\n  * Proposal Authors and Contributors: 100k ARB\n\n# Proposal Contributors\n\nWhat changed: Added new contributors, working group\n\nWorking group:\n\n* Dan Peng (PM / Author)\n* Karel Vuong (Author)\n* Marcus Segal\n* Rick Johanson\n\nDjinn (Dan Peng) - PM / Author\n\nKarel Vuong - Author (Co-Founder, Treasure)\n\nMarcus Segal - Contributor\n\nRick Johanson - Contributor\n\nXai Games - Advisor / Contributor\n\nL2Beats - Delegate Feedback\n\nHelika - Advisor / Contributor\n\nJason Lee - Advisor / Contributor (ExPolygon Games, current web3 gaming founder)\n\n# Resources & Content\n\nMessage from Arbitrum Foundation related to Multisig Wallet - https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/catalyze-gaming-ecosystem-growth-on-arbitrum/22368/178\n\n\n\nWhat changed: -\n\nGCP AMA / Open Office 3/15/24 - [https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1RDGllYMYvOGL?s=20 26 2](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1RDGllYMYvOGL?s=20)\n\nGCP AMA 5/8/24 - [https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1788281797081456938?s=46 5](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1788281797081456938?s=46)"

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Register $BORING in the Arbitrum generic-custom gateway\n# Disclaimer from L2BEAT\n\nThis proposal is one of several similar maintenance proposals that have been put forward recently and require a constitutional vote.  Back in September last year, [we indicated](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/enhancing-multichain-governance-upgrading-rari-governance-token-on-arbitrum/26096/39) that such updates should be handled differently, but no such initiative has been proposed so far. We have been asked to support this proposal, which we are doing through this vote. Separately, we will request a dedicated discussion to address these issues in future. However, such a discussion should not delay this proposal or any others of a similar nature in the meantime.\n\n# Abstract\n\n[https://superboring.xyz](https://superboring.xyz) is about to expand to Arbitrum, thus the $BORING token shall become bridgeable to Arbitrum.\n\n# Motivation\n\n$BORING is used to incentivize markets and can thus help drive adoption both to the Superboring protocol and the underlying chain.\n\n# Rationale\n\nArbitrum wants to help scale Ethereum. Allowing tokens to be bridged back and forth is key to this.\n\n# Specifications\n\n$BORING on Ethereum is a simple, non-upgradable ERC20 contract, deployed to 0x0Bc4dF77353ae96f31bC82bC2536bb23B2009919.\n\n$BORING on Arbitrum is a Super Token - essentially an ERC20 token with advanced capabilities like streaming and scalable distribution. It\u2019s deployed by the same deployer account, to the same address: 0x0Bc4dF77353ae96f31bC82bC2536bb23B2009919 .\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nAccording to the Arbitrum bridge docs, bridging to an Arbitrum token with custom logic requires registration in the Arbitrum generic-custom gateway, which can be done either by the L1 token contract itself or by the Arbitrum DAO. Since the L1 token contract was deployed in the past without knowing this requirement, and is not upgradable, the latter option is needed.\n\n# Timeline\n\nSuperboring on Arbitrum is expected to go live in a couple of weeks.\n$BORING availability is not blocking, but would help make this deployment more attractive.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nWe assume the process of token registration to be well known and thus incur no or negligible cost for the DAO."

    "description": "# [Non-constitutional] Proposal to fund Plurality Labs Milestone 1B(ridge)\n## Introduction\n\nBack in August, Arbitrum DAO passed our AIP-3 to build a pluralistic grants framework that decentralizes grants decision-making, avoids capture and scales valuable grants allocations, and grows the Arbitrum ecosystem overall.\n\nOur proposal [passed on Tally](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976) with ~99% of delegate votes. It had overwhelming support, we believe, because you a) trust our motives and capabilities, and b) understand how big and important the problem is:\n\nNearly every DAO struggles to create sustainable value - largely because DAO decision-making is famously slow, and inefficient, which drives them to compromise their values and centralize. Arbitrum is committed to being better, and you believed in our ability to help.\n\n## Background (Milestone 1a Retrospective)\n\nAcross Milestones 1a, we pluralistically deployed funds via 12 different grants programs and different modalities for grants decision-making.\n\nExperimenting with multiple modalities allows us to allocate grants to support quick feedback about what works and can scale now. We can quickly evolve our grants decision making based the below success rubric, which determines where to allocate grants:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/19f2561a1ec3653e1dbc41d5a646874c679c4d6a_2_621x415.jpeg)\n\n* Grow = double-down / start to scale\n* Coach = make changes / try again\n* Cut = discontinue / recommend to seed program\n\nIn Milestone 1a, we seeded the initial 12 Grants Programs. In Milestone 1b, we will lean on our newly established Plurality Labs board (more later!) as well as community voices who can evaluate our grants via our Thrive Protocol to inform where to cut, coach, and grow.\n\n\\[Based on our pluralistic grants framework and success criteria, these are the current results of milestone 1 ([details here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/plurality-labs-milestone-1-review/20198/2?u=senad.eth))]\n\n### Milestone 1a Wins include:\n\n* Firestarters: Four proposals passed Snapshot because of our Firestarters program - which funds unbiased research, cat herding, and crafting of proposals crucial to the DAO. These include STIP, ARDC, ARPC, and STEP. ([TNorm talking about our role with STIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pAiy5IABZ48b0o-NqVIRcu4_NRuM9vzI/view?usp=sharing))\n* Experimenting with Grants Decision-Making Modalities: We drove over 30 experiments in collective decision-making, including proactive and retroactive grant-making, and grant-making driven by experts, expert-counsels, permissionless counsels, random counsels, and direct input mechanisms.\n* Retroactive Grants: We drove the first retroactive grants program in Arbitrum, rewarding unpaid contributors, and setting the stage for follow-on experiments. Some of these people are creating obvious value in the ecosystem now, like Atom from castlecap who is now an LTIPP advisor.\n* Quadratic Funding: Via Gitcoin, we brought thousands of new users, and hundreds of builders and builder projects to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Milestone 1a Lessons:\n\n* Investing in documentation: We funded 250+ projects, and spurred movement all over the DAO. But we didn\u2019t document our work and value well. More importantly, we didn\u2019t deliver certain written deliverables that people in the DAO were expecting on time. It hurt us. We won\u2019t make that mistake again.\n* Investing in communications: Our bias was for action. We cared about creating value and learning - and put blinders on for everything else. We should have hired a Marketing or Comms person. We didn\u2019t. Going forward, we\u2019ll button up. We have a good story to tell. We\u2019re excited to tell it.\n* Leveraging internal team: Plurality Labs was acquired by ThriveCoin in August of 2023. We have a team of 26 people who support other big ecosystems. We could have leveraged Thrive best practices. But in an effort to stay \u201ctrue\u201d to the Milestone 1 proposal, we kept the teams separate - too separate. We\u2019ll use all available resources this time.\n\n### Vision\n\nWe have a big vision. We\u2019re seeking to build the most robust pluralistic grants ecosystem in DAO history. To do it, we took some big shots on goal in Milestone 1a - funding 12 grant programs using 30 decision making experiments to fund 250+ projects. Some shots scored and others missed.\n\nThis is aligned with the expectations of the pluralistic grants approach. The only way to create and scale pluralistic grants is to decentralize bet taking\u2026 and to get as comfortable with the shots that embarrassingly fly into the stands as we are with the goals.\n\nWe will use data to help us double-down on winners and cut others. With the data we\u2019re collecting, we will create a robust, long-term pluralistic grants framework for Arbitrum DAO. This framework is emerging now, and it will continue to become clearer throughout Milestone 1b(ridge).\n\n## Milestone 1(bridge):\n\nIn our maiden proposal, the principal outcome we sought to achieve was to demonstrate that we could deliver and scale enormous value creation via a pluralistic grants framework. The general feedback from delegates has been: kind of\u2026\n\nThere seems to be wide agreement that we created value but need to scale,  document, and showcase.\n\nThus, after consultation with a number of the top delegates, we created this Milestone 1b(ridge) proposal that asks for the exact same amount of ARB and same timeframe as passed with 99% of delegate vote in August.\n\nIn Milestone 1b, we will show:\n\n1. We can build on winners and cut underperformers with our initial grants allocations.\n2. We can continue to drive experimentation with new grants allocations.\n3. We can deliver on all deliverables for Milestone 1 to the satisfaction of our top delegates.\n4. We can leverage better tech and systems to support further scale in Milestone 2.\n\nTo ensure we achieve these goals, we are implementing best-practices from the Thrive team that, also, are aligned with feedback we received from delegates:\n\n1. Plurality Labs Board: We are welcoming a board of top voices in the Arbitrum community for oversight, and to ensure decentralized decision-making.\n2. Human validations: Thrive Protocol allows us to validate when value is created, and pay out funds to projects upon value creation. This is critical for scale. We\u2019ll use it.\n3. Team upgrade: We are bringing in the big guns for this one, adding team members that know grants, know DAOs, and know scale.\n\nHere\u2019s more information about our commitments in Milestone 1b(ridge):\n\nPlurality Labs Board: We brought together trusted and known voices in the Arbitrum community. Their role with us is to gather feedback and data from our Arbitrum community, and to make strategic decisions about grants allocators, specific grants / contributions, and validations.\n\nThis board is part of this vote. We found people to represent the different stakeholder groups in Arbitrum. Now your votes will ratify this group - which includes two who voted \"No\" to our temp check for Milestone 2!\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81db971f7a5e9910d522a44171d3f3625bffb3cb_2_936x702.jpeg)\n\nHuman Validations: Going forward, we will fund our grants at specific milestones of value creation. White-listed Arbitrum community members will - in a pluralistic way - help clarify when value is created, and will also be rewarded for their services (more on this later).\n\nTeam revamp: We are fully utilizing our 26-person ThriveCoin team), we have also added some key team members to our roster, including: Ben West (GitCoin grants lead), Kyler Wandler (DAO Research Collective), and Scott Mandel (Complex Labs, Flexa, 2Q Ventures).\n\n## Cost\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we\u2019ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework. We are also adding a layer of oversight to our work - welcoming an esteemed Plurality Labs board. They will, among other things, help ensure we deliver the value we promise.\n\nThe 560k ARB services fee (same ARB and same buckets as first proposal) includes:\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we\u2019ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework.

If we do our work right (and we believe we\u2019re on the right track) we should be spurring thriving, net-positive ecosystem activity in Arbitrum for years to come.\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ll be doing it via a pluralistic grants framework that has a consistent bias for value creation, further decentralization, and resistance to capture. We will be building the future of web3 together, and providing a path for all great people and teams to work with Arbitrum.\n\nWhen the value of Milestone 1b is obvious, we\u2019ll present Milestone 2."

    "description": "# AIP 4\n# Proposal: Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit\n**Category: Constitutional - Process**\n\n* Disclaimers:\n1. The text changed slightly since snapshot (becuase of L2Beat's forum comment)\n2. This proposal and the attached executable were created by the Arbitrum Foundation *\n\n## High Level Overview\nThe ArbitrumDAO Constitution specifies that the first Security Council election should start on the 15th September alongside a specification for the election.\n\nAn on-chain implementation of the entire election is still a work in progress. The Arbitrum Foundation has sponsored the implementation of a smart contract suite by Offchain Labs, an extension of Tally\u2019s user interface, and the respective audits.\n\nThis proposal seeks to revise the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to provide flexibility for the start date of the election. If passed by a Constitutional Vote, the new start date will be on the 15th September or the earliest possible date in which an on-chain election can begin.\n\nThe motivation to change the election\u2019s start date is to provide time for the implementation to be completed, security audits to be performed, for the community to gain confidence in the quality of its implementation and for the Arbitrum DAO to vote on a separate Constitutional AIP to install an on-chain election system.\n\nThe overarching goal is to still allow the election to begin on the 15th September, but it is prudent to provide leeway and ensure all parties, especially the Arbitrum DAO, are confident in the election software\u2019s security and completeness.\n\n## Path to a Smart Contract Enabled Election\nThis proposal seeks approval from the Arbitrum DAO that the first and all subsequent security elections should be performed via the on-chain election process.\n\nThe activation of the Security Council election is dependent on:\n\n- Complete implementation for the on-chain smart contracts,\n- Complete implementation of the user interface,\n- Smart contract audit by a highly regarded auditing firm,\n- All parties, including the Arbitrum DAO, have gained confidence in the implementation\u2019s completeness and security,\n- Successful Constitutional Vote by the DAO to install the new election software.\n\nA vote on this proposal is approving that the above conditions are mandatory for any election software before it can be installed into the on-chain smart contracts.\n\n## Modified Start Date for Election\nThe implementation sponsored by the Arbitrum Foundation should be ready for the start date of the 15th September.\n\nEven so, given the naunces of implementation details and the potential security risks to a critical part of the system, we believe it is still prudent to provide leeway and extra time for the Security Council elections to begin some time after the required date set out by The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nAfter all, it is not just about having a complete implementation, but ensuring all parties have confidence that all efforts have made been to minimize the risk of bugs in the implementation.\n\n###  Revision to ArbitrumDAO Constitution\nThe revised text focuses on the election beginning at the earliest possible date from the 15th September. Additionally, the election can only begin once an on-chain election system is installed via a separate Constitutional Vote.\n\nAll future elections can begin exactly six months after the previous election. As such, the chosen date for the first election will decide the earliest start date for the next election.\n\nFor extra clarity in the text, we have renamed \u201cSeptember Cohort\u201d to \u201cFirst Cohort\u201d and \u201cMarch Cohort\u201d to \u201cSecond Cohort\u201d\n\nFinally, to remove any ambiguity, all security council members are expected to serve the time until the new Security Council members are installed in the respective smart contracts.\n\n### Current text of ArbitrumDAO Constitution:\n\n> The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into a September Cohort of 6 members, and a March Cohort of 6 members. Every year on September 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 September Cohort seats; and every year on March 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 March Cohort seats.\n\n> This means that the initial September Cohort will serve an initial term of 6 months, whereas the initial March Cohort will serve an initial term of 1 year.\n\n> The initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the September Cohort and 6 members in the March Cohort. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report \n\n\n### Proposed Revision of Arbitrum Constitution:\n\n> The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\n> The initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the \u2018First Cohort\u2019 and 6 members in the \u2018Second Cohort\u2019. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report here.\n\n> The first security election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date. The election can only begin upon the availability of an on-chain election process that was approved and installed by the Arbitrum DAO. This first election replaces the \u2018First Cohort\u2019. The next election replaces the \u2018Second Cohort\u2019 and so forth.\n\n> The date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has started and it will replace its respective cohort of 6 members.\n\n> All Security Council members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\n## AIP 4 executable code\n\nThis document explains how to create a governance proposal, which can trigger an [AIP action contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x85792f6BF346e3Bfd3A275318aDd2c44A1058447#code). \n\nThe AIP can be created in https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/create\n\nTo go through the [governance lifecycle](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#proposal-lifecycle), the proposal's executable code must first trigger a L2 to L1 transaction through the ArbSys precompile.\n\nFor AIP 4, the `Arbitrum Core` should be selected since this is a constitutional proposal. \n\nTarget contract address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064`\n\nCalldata\n\n```\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\n\n```\n\nTo verify the above the calldata, you can generate it yourself with the code from https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/130.\nTo do so, you want to run `scripts/proposals/AIP4/generateProposalData.ts` then encode it as an L2 to L1 transaction to ArbSys, as seen in `sims/arbcore-aip4.sim.ts` from https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/blob/117639ff19b3c9a664fd92db4e0f4dbabb2a932b/sims/arbcore-aip4.sim.ts#L19\n\nThe deployment can be checked with https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/57758a4e203f43566f587a77282e8a078d1a9ce2/scripts/proposals/AIP4/verifyDeployment.ts\n\nThe side effects of running the proposal can also be verified with [governance-seatbelt](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt)\n\n\n\n\n"

    "description": "# Experimental Delegates Incentive System\n# Final Version with Option 2 (Karma)\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is the final result of the proposal published and voted in favor of option 2 in snapshot. It contains some minor changes.\n\n* [Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/19467)\n* [Snapshots Voting: Option 2 - With Karma](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xef3ed3b3735cad375953947437980db576baebbba5a0c209b2cccabcb1c30740)\n\n# **Spec: Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number of eligible delegates to **50**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a good starting point, these ranking is based on the score they achieve each month.\n\n## Funding\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n**Total costs: 1,580,000 ARB**\n\n## **Delegate Selection Process**\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single-tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\\* So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\\* The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\\* Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:1.

They must post using the template provided below, within a 14-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\\* Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\\* Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid monthly, we will use a point system and a framework. Please note that this framework will be developed by Karma. Delegates can track their activities using this template.\n\n![image](upload://jR5ofua1KGdUBlRqyh5OwcAlXCo.png)![](https://static.tally.xyz/e6a52900-773d-4b73-abee-6b68d095ce0b_original.png)\n\n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table <https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power>\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. Karma pulls the participation activity directly from onchain transactions. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR \\* 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Rn) / CR(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposal (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Rn) / CP(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 \\* TP% / 100))**\n\n### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + %CP + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum\u2019s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n* Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n* Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n* Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n* Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n* Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no?\n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nOn the last day of each month, the incentive system administrator is responsible for collecting and carefully reviewing the data provided by Karma. During this initial stage, several inconsistencies are likely to be identified and corrected. Subsequently, the administrator should announce on the forum the names of the delegates selected to receive incentives, as well as the amounts allocated to each. This procedure must be completed within 10 days.\n\nAfter the publication of these results, the delegates will have a period of 2 days to present any dispute, in case they disagree with the amounts or the selection made.\n\n### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success.\n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be executed from the programs multisig, with full details of the payments posted on the forum, between the 13th and 14th. This will be repeated for the duration of the program.\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the administration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the administration of said program, the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and it will be managed from the DAOs multisig.\n\n***\n\n# **Karma automation for the delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. They have committed themselves to incorporating any modification to the dashboard, understanding the experimental nature of this program. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n   **Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates\u2019 forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n* **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n* **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n* **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n* **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n* **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n* **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on the successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n* **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n## Multisig Management\n\nSince it would be very complicated to KYC 50 delegates (or more) for this program, and following the Foundation's recommendation, we're going to proceed with a multisig to manage payments.\n\nWe propose to use a configuration similar to that of [Plurality Labs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976#multisig-management-13). Having a 3/5 multisig where apart from myself, there would be a mix of DAO delegates + contributors, each receiving a 1,000 ARB payment per month for the duration of the program and said signers would be required to undergo a KYC process.\n\n#### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module\n\n* DAO can clawback funds from multisig directly to its treasury with a vote\n* Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers\n* This multisig will be configured with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally.\n\n#### Signatories\n\nWe propose that the signatories be:\n\n* @Frisson\n* @dk3\n* @JoJo\n* @0xWenMoon\n* @cattin\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nWe will also assume the responsibilities of the incentive system administrator, as mentioned in the previous points.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma, nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## Key Points\n\n**Scoring**\n\n* Karma Delegate Dashboard\n\n**Minimum score to receive incentives**\n\n* TP= +60%\n\n**Bonus Point**\n\n* +30% TP\n\n**Parameter Snapshot**\n\n* Last day of the month 23:59 UTC\n\n**Dispute**\n\n* 2 days\n\n**Payments**\n\n* On the 13th-14th of each month from the multisig.\n\n**Incentive system administrator**\n\n* SEED Latam / Any delegate or entity willing to collaborate\n\n### Total Cost: 1,580,000\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n> **Note**\n> Costs may vary since we probably won't give the max amount to every delegate every month, so the cost mentioned would be the max this program would cost assuming we compensate 50 delegates per month for 6 months with the maximum allocation.\n\n## Reports\n\nSEEDLatam commits to delivering two reports, one after the third month and one after the sixth (and final) month of the program with metrics on its impact, delegates' performance, and expenditures. They will also collect feedback from both the community and participating delegates.\n\n*The reports will be a detailed forum post and also accompanied by a community call explaining the metrics and feedback collected.*\n\n**ArbitrumDAO has the power to:**\n\n* Change the direction or parameters of the program when it deems necessary, with a snapshot vote.\n* Terminate the program at any time, with a snapshot vote.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nPlease note that this initial incentive system is experimental and is not intended to be the final version. With this initiative, we aim to evaluate the performance of the DAO and determine its impact. We also anticipate collaboration from both the DAO and facilitators to ensure its success.\n\nAt the end of the six months, SEED Latam commits to delivering a report containing the gathered data and feedback from the governance.\n\n## Modifications introduced post-snapshot\n\n* Karma integration (since option 2 won)\n* One additional parameter to include forum activity\n* Multisig since it would be operationally unviable to KYC every delegate"

    "description": "# Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal\n**Abstract:**\nThis proposal recommends the allocation of 500,000 $ARB tokens, equivalent to 0.005% of the total supply, to acknowledge and reward the outstanding contributions of Arbitrum community members known as \u201cArbiters.\u201d These contributors have played pivotal roles in Arbitrum\u2019s development, from translation and publicity to community support and protection from fraudulent activity. By establishing a transparent and equitable reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, we aim to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication, fostering the growth of our ecosystem.\n\n**Motivation:**\nThe Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\n1. Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum\u2019s development.\n2. Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\n3. Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\n4. Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in\u00a0**shaping Arbitrum over the past two years**. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.\n\n**Partial contribution value**\nSince 2021-2023, the work and contributions made by Arbiter are too numerous to list and quantify individually, and the data provided are statistically estimated due to the lack of prior targeted data counting and retention.\n\n1. Provided millions of help to Arbitrum community users and developers. It allows Arbitrum team members to focus more on the development of technology, and also allows millions of Arbitrum community members to get answers to all kinds of questions and needs feedback. (Anyone can view the help and contributions of the arbitrators on the arbitrum Discord server, wechat groups, and other language communities, etc.)\n2. Arbiters are online 24/7 (in Odyssey and Guild activities related to many arbiters are 16 + hours online, for community members to provide the most immediate, high-quality help) arbiter two years, has been involved in the maintenance and management of the community order, to report and stop more than 100,000 times of the scam, to ensure that hundreds of thousands of members of the community are able to get help in a timely manner and to keep the server safe.\n3. Establish Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and other Arbitrum local communities, such as: Chinese more than 10 WeChat groups, WeChat public number, microblog, Coinhub, and other media (due to policy reasons, a number of Chinese media has canceled the account)The establishment of language communities has further expanded Arbitrum\u2019s influence, attracted more than 100,000 users and developers to choose to use Arbitrum, and promoted the prosperity of the ecosystem.\n4. Translate and proofread more than 50 Arbitrum articles, arbiters in various language areas edit, typeset and publish Arbitrum daily information more than 2,000 times, publish more than 300 articles and blogs, explain more than 50 videos, and all kinds of accounts with a large number of real fans and readers, for hundreds of thousands of users around the world to provide a quick understanding of the use of Arbitrum and the information and guidelines.\n5. arbiter has provided community optimization, management, operation, and promotion suggestions for arbitrum more than 300 times, making the system of Arbitrum publicity, service, promotion, and operation more perfect, and allowing Arbitrum users, developers, and ecosystem projects to get better service experience and help.\n6. dock 30 Arbitrum AMA, more than 20 events, more than 100 docking projects, affecting hundreds of thousands of community members, attracting more than 50 projects to choose an arbitrum network for deployment.\n7. Some Arbiters have their own communities, and as KOLs in Twitter and famous communities, they vigorously promote Arbitrum through their own influence, posting blogs and all kinds of information, and their continuous influence involves hundreds of thousands of crypto community users. This has brought great enthusiasm and new users to the Arbitrum community.\n8. arbiters has been accompanying and witnessing the prosperous development of the Arbitrum community and ecosystem, continuously carrying forward the spirit of the Arbitrum community and promoting and marketing Arbitrum.\n\nFrom 6,400 wallet addresses at the initial mainnet launch to 1,270,000+ wallet addresses now, including the growth of on-chain TVLs and a thriving ecosystem. Helped and assisted Arbitrum Discord to grow from tens of thousands of members to now 460,000, providing millions of high quality help, all kinds of Arbitrum promotion and publicity with millions of views.\n\n***The following document is the basis for some of the contribute saved***\n\\[[arbiter Simple example table of contributions in different categories - Google Sheets\u00a034](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit?usp=sharing)]\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n*Beneficiaries:*\nArbiters: Comprising the most dedicated contributors to the Arbitrum community over the past two years, recognized for their exceptional and humble service to the Arbitrum community.\n\n*Distribution of Incentives:*\nThe Arbitrum community requests a total of 500,000 $ARB tokens, to be evenly distributed among 24 of its members, recognizing their past work for the Arbitrum community.\n\nCalculation: 20,833.333 $ARB tokens per member x 24 Discord Arbiter = 500,000 $ARB\n\n**Wallet Address Collection and Distribution:**\nArbiters\u2019 contributor wallet addresses will be collected through a specified process, ensuring accuracy and fairness. If the proposal is approved, the Arbitrum DAO will disburse rewards to each Arbiter contributor\u2019s address, following thorough verification and confirmation.\n\n**Future Plans:**\nUpon the successful implementation of this proposal, we will continue to enhance Arbiter contribution methods, ensuring the sustained growth of the arbitrum community.\n\narbiters will continue to translate blogs, do publicity, organize AMAs, hold offline activities, provide community suggestions, optimize community services, maintain community order, provide high-quality help to the community, actively connect with various activities and projects, and help promote cooperation with other communities. On the basis of arbitrum, actively participate in the arbitrum Ambassador Program and explore more ways to contribute, and continue to provide value to the broader arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOur goal is to continually contribute value to arbitrum and collaborate with the broader community to foster a vibrant and thriving arbitrum ecosystem.\nAs arbitrum continues to evolve, we will also be able to really demonstrate our knowledge of the protocol and help show more new users that arbitrum is the optimal scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\n**Milestones**\nWhen the arbitrum discord server exceeds 700,000 members,or when TVL passes $3b,or when we have helped community members more than two million times, or when we have made significant progress in various types of outreach and publicity. We are committed to transparently communicating milestone updates and displaying data about what arbiters are doing or contributing.\n\nAfter this proposal, we will pay attention to the statistics and retention of examples of contributions made by arbiters, and data. This will facilitate more detailed examples and data presentation at the next milestone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe implementation of a robust reward system via the Arbitrum DAO is crucial for recognizing and appreciating the invaluable contributions of Arbiters to the community. This initiative will reinvigorate community engagement, foster openness, and encourage sustained participation, ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum community. Transparency, fairness, and continuous improvement based on community input will be at the forefront of this endeavor. With this proposal, we are confident in building a more collaborative, innovative, and dynamic Arbitrum community that embodies the values and spirit of our ecosystem.\n\nYour insights are valued and essential in shaping the future of our community. We welcome you to provide feedback and engage with us.\n\n\n\n**List of Arbiters\u2019 partial contributions and arbiter profile info,For the sake of DAO reps checking for updates, we\u2019ve listed them separately**\n\n* <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit#gid=336825191>\n* <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit#gid=2082014896>\n\n*Additionally, the Arbiter with Discord ID BILLY#7943 has voluntarily forfeited his reward and split it equally amongst the other Arbiters, so we will be modifying the original forum proposal and will be changing the 25 Arbiters in the original proposal to 24, so that the final calculation will be: 20,833.333 $ARB tokens per member x 24 Discord Arbiter = 500,000 $ARB*"

    "description": "# OpCo: A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal builds on the ideas and concepts introduced by\u00a0[@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3)\u00a0in the initial\u00a0[Operation Company (OpCo) proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737). The OpCo is a legal entity that delegates and key stakeholders can leverage to achieve DAO-defined goals, principally by forming an operational mesh layer and assigning internal employees or negotiating and entering into agreements with service providers and individual contributors to facilitate initiatives. OpCo\u2019s mission is to negate identified frictions affecting the DAO\u2019s strategy execution, such as allowing for the establishment of more operational roles for the DAO, facilitating efficient and competitive contributor and service provider negotiations and information flow between these parties, creating clear responsibilities for carrying out initiatives, and helping ensure the continuation of programs the DAO depends upon. OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes a potential advancement that could be made within its mandated focus areas, it can work on and propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nAs it currently stands, the Arbitrum DAO is generally unable to move swiftly when it requires specialized contributors to execute a strategy, for which there isn\u2019t a straightforward and low-friction approach, with these processes typically requiring a vast amount of effort from the supply side instead of being driven by the demand side. Moreover, many initiatives, especially more complex and wider-reaching ones, lack clear owners in charge of ensuring a holistic approach to execution and initiatives\u2019 continuation, meaning that in the unfortunate case that a service provider decides/is forced to disengage from its duties, there aren\u2019t always accountable individuals or entities that would push the initiatives forward. OpCo\u2019s goal is to function as the entity the DAO can leverage to remedy these limitations and move forward in areas that require a more structured approach.\n\nTo cover OpCo\u2019s operating expenses over the first 30 months, including full-time staff appointed internally, setup and other admin costs, as well as the DAO-adjacent entity\u2019s oversight committee, this proposal suggests earmarking 30M ARB (subject to change in either direction if market conditions change notably between the Snapshot and Tally votes) for the initiative:\n\n* 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo\u2019s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees\u2019 payouts additionally being performance-based.\n* Of the remaining 26M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB\u2019s price of $0.68 as of January 21st, this would require roughly 18M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following the proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact.\n* After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 30M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"500\" width=\"566\" alt=\"Requested ARB\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6ec9b9968091e7de20dd115487e9c09f4c254322_2_566x500.png\" />Requested ARB1450\u00d71280 153 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6ec9b9968091e7de20dd115487e9c09f4c254322.png \"Requested ARB\")\n\n\n\nOpCo will be able to utilize the $12M in cash equivalents as follows:\n\n* $2.5M worth of stable assets released upfront.\n* Once OpCo has officially operationalized, the entity can draw up to $500K of cash equivalents each month.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nPresently, most DAO programs operate in silos, leading to, among other things, redundant efforts and non-existing cross-initiative resources. The DAO also generally depends on a single initiative leader for the continuation of a successful program, while some initiatives don\u2019t even have clear owners, which adds significant friction to strategy execution. DAOs are also inherently disadvantaged when evaluating and swiftly engaging individual contributors or service providers, and Arbitrum is no exception. This proposal aims to provide the DAO with the capabilities to nullify the abovementioned frictions by creating a DAO-adjacent legal entity\u2014OpCo. Among other things, the DAO may choose to leverage OpCo to manage:\n\n* Operational support & project planning,\n* Project management of DAO initiatives,\n* Negotiations with service providers,\n* Allocation of resources across contributors & DAO-approved projects\n\nOpCo will grant the Arbitrum DAO better capabilities to bootstrap initiatives and secure the continuation and execution of them, while also expanding the total addressable contributor and service provider base as certain sensitive negotiations and deal terms don\u2019t necessarily have to be disclosed publicly. Moreover, the DAO-adjacent entity will function as the operational mesh layer for individual contributors and service providers, streamlining communications and knowledge sharing across engaged entities and individuals.\n\nOverall, the DAO\u2019s past, current, and likely upcoming initiatives can be divided into 5 high-level categories: Governance Frameworks, Financial Management, Investments, Ecosystem Support, and Grants. The initiatives, their respective owners, and into which of the 5 categories they fall are visualized below.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"388\" width=\"690\" alt=\"OpCo 1\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/173ff0b350b196f8546db6797137e4dd8c08a288_2_690x388.png\" />OpCo 11600\u00d7900 135 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/173ff0b350b196f8546db6797137e4dd8c08a288.png \"OpCo 1\")\n\n\n\nIt is of utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO maintains a decentralized and bottoms-up system for bootstrapping new projects, DAO contributors, and setting strategies, including creating and steering the DAO\u2019s vision, mission, and purpose, as well as approaches to achieve the goals and decision-making. As such, OpCo will be focused on the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management initiative categories, but note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category if the DAO so chooses through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d).\n\nThe entity\u2019s main focus is to increase the efficiency of strategy execution through operational optimization and, in particular, activating and recruiting the optimal stakeholders, contributors, and service providers. For the avoidance of doubt, the DAO would always have ultimate authority over OpCo, with the entity purely being a helpful resource focused on streamlining wider-reaching and complex initiatives that require a more structured execution framework as well as helping push the DAO forward within areas where the entity identifies shortcomings. We want to stress the importance of ensuring that one of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s key differentiators\u2014enabling new participants to join the ecosystem and make an impact, growing into well-established contributors\u2014is conserved. Without Arbitrum DAO empowering its contributors and delegates, the DAO might sacrifice one of its core strengths, and we believe that entities such as SEEDGov, Entropy Advisors, Tally, etc., are present within the ecosystem exactly because of this empowerment.\n\nArbitrum has one of the most active and engaged DAOs within the industry, combined with help from the Arbitrum Foundation and robust programs for bootstrapping and fostering growth within the ecosystem. Although there is always room for improvement, these factors have enabled the DAO to allocate grants with positive results, sustaining a vibrant and welcoming ecosystem. Having said that, if the DAO wishes to, it can expand OpCo\u2019s mandate to include grants in the future through a Snapshot vote. When it comes to investments from treasury funds, the GCP has been established to facilitate capital allocation into the gaming sector, while the AVI is currently working on setting up a structure allowing the DAO to make venture bets across other verticals, which is why OpCo will be excluded from operating within the investments category. As alluded to earlier, we also feel as though it\u2019s crucial that the facilitation and implementation of governance frameworks continue being driven by decentralized actors, but the DAO could again expand OpCo\u2019s operations into this initiative category if it so wishes.\n\nWith that said, certain clear inefficiencies have been identified with respect to the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories. This is likely due to the operational frameworks enabling execution for these categories still being somewhat underexplored areas. As such, there is a lack of ownership, and the DAO has no structured way to frictionlessly operationalize contributors to push complex challenges forward within these verticals, often requiring a vast amount of Arbitrum DAO-specific knowledge and even lobbying efforts from the supply side instead of the demand side. Due to the current structure, active governance participants are generally purely incentivized to prioritize strategies that they are fit to solve. This has left certain critical domains unattended and reflects the need for an entity that could be mandated to help define the root causes of execution obstacles and provide solutions to remedy them.\n\nThe aforementioned inefficiencies are naturally amplified by the fact that the number of potential contributors is often restricted due to many initiatives requiring deep specialization. Finding the facilitators capable of managing initiatives end-to-end within these categories can be difficult. Oftentimes, the contributor and owner roles for initiatives are separated or there is not a clear owner at all, meaning that no one party is responsible for the continuation of these initiatives. For initiatives where the contributor and owner roles are the same or there is a clearly defined owner, the DAO generally relies on a single party for the continuation of the initiative. If the service provider or contributor, for any reason, decides or is forced to exit the ecosystem, there is not a well-defined framework for the initiative to be moved to a new owner.\n\nAs initiated, OpCo\u2019s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates. However, OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developments could be made, it can propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nTypically, the current protocol for the execution of strategies and new initiatives within the DAO\u2019s two aforementioned focus areas is as follows: (i) either the proposer defines the strategic approach and goals for the initiative or a working group is created that aims to outline these specifics such that a proposal can be created, with the working group also sometimes facilitating some or all of the work required for the execution of the strategy; (ii) if not done by the working group, the proposer or proposer-connected party is contracted to facilitate the strategy or the DAO runs some type of a procurement/election process to decide the service providers or contributors; (iii) once the work has been performed and the facilitators\u2019 term ends, a continuation proposal is created if the initiative has a clear owner. Otherwise, individual DAO contributors are required to take charge of the initiative and push it forward.\n\nIf OpCo were to be created, it would primarily be leveraged to assume responsibility for phases (ii) and (iii). I.e., the DAO defines strategies or simply strategic goals. If a clear executor to reach the key objectives exists within the DAO, they could be chosen as a facilitator and would be contracted by the OpCo. If not, OpCo could be mandated to execute these strategies by either assigning existing internal employees, hiring new internal resources, or contracting outside service providers/individual contributors to perform the required undertakings. However, if the DAO isn\u2019t proactively defining strategies/strategic goals, OpCo is required to be active within this area as well, given it has the bandwidth to do so, with these OpCo-created strategies then ratified by the DAO through the regular voting process.\n\nOpCo would have full discretion over hiring internal employees, while anyone interested in facilitating a DAO initiative could propose themselves (or another party) for that. Such a proposal must include a capital allocation to cover the facilitator\u2019s expenses since OpCo\u2019s budget only covers internal employees\u2019 salaries. If approved through governance, the facilitator would then be contracted by OpCo as a service provider for the DAO. Depending on what is viewed as the most efficient approach, OpCo will have the ability to negotiate and run procurement processes both privately and publicly, which will further strengthen the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s ability to attract and retain top talent, with all information that can be shared with the wider DAO being made available through oversight and financial reports. The below slide depicts OpCo\u2019s initial focus categories, but please note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"388\" width=\"690\" alt=\"OpCo M\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dbaa8d6981fc1566e7cf02e6137d67b1905d8f15_2_690x388.png\" />OpCo M1600\u00d7900 152 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/dbaa8d6981fc1566e7cf02e6137d67b1905d8f15.png \"OpCo M\")\n\n\n\nIf a DAO-ratified strategy or strategic goal that the OpCo is mandated to facilitate doesn\u2019t have a specific end date, the DAO-adjacent entity would continue executing until the entity feels as though the associated goals have been reached or the DAO instructs the entity to stop executing by passing a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d). If the work is expected to be long-term in nature, OpCo would be responsible for ensuring that it can be continued by accounting for associated costs in its budget extension request.\n\nFor example, delegates could define a high-level events strategy by deciding the number of events the Arbitrum DAO should be represented at in 2025, whether the strategy facilitator is the proposer, a proposer-related party, an OpCo internal employee, or someone who is chosen through a procurement process, and approving the strategy\u2019s costs that are not covered by OpCo\u2019s budget (i.e., salaries if the facilitators are not full-time staff appointed internally, booking event venues, catering, etc.) through the typical governance process, after which OpCo plans the exact events to participate in, contracts the required service providers or operationalizes internal employees, and manages all involved stakeholders and other related aspects throughout the process.\n\nService providers and individual contributors that are currently contracted, or will likely be in the near future, with the Arbitrum Foundation and fall within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories, such as SEEDGov in its role as the Delegate Incentive Program Manager, MSS members, firms forming the ADPC, Entropy Advisors, etc., should collaborate closely with OpCo once its operations are fully established and stabilized. Once fully operational, OpCo will have the capacity to project manage and oversee these initiatives according to its complete mandate. The long-term vision for this process is as follows:\n\n1. OpCo\u2019s core team is hired, and operations begin;\n2. OpCo demonstrates product-market fit (i.e., the DAO is satisfied with the entity\u2019s output) and that it has adequate processes, capabilities, and any other relevant functions to execute according to its complete mandate;\n3. OpCo is prepared to oversee full-time DAO operations, assuming existing contributor contracts through novation and managing new initiatives on behalf of the DAO (e.g., by ensuring that appropriate KYC measures and documentation are implemented).\n\nIn the case that an integral facilitator within the Ecosystem Support or Financial Management categories (or any other category OpCo might be mandated to operate within in the future) exits the ecosystem for any reason and an initiative is left without an owner, the DAO could likewise mandate OpCo to find a replacement solution.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm). OpCo internal full-time employees cannot be contributors to DAO initiatives as individuals (they need to do so through OpCo) and are strictly prohibited from entering into employment engagements with other DAOs, organizations, entities, or comparable affiliations, whilst contractors that facilitate a specific vertical and are signed to OpCo can have engagements in other DAO initiatives and outside of the ecosystem. Full-time OpCo staff can only be appointed internally. However, as mentioned earlier, the DAO can roll any service provider or individual contributor into OpCo by passing an onchain vote. This vote has to request capital to cover the facilitators\u2019 expenses since when it comes to salaries, OpCo\u2019s budget only covers internal full-time staff. OpCo is expected to work closely with Offchain Labs as well as the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that scopes of work do not overlap.\n\nIndividual contributors, service providers, and other analogous entities are naturally free to go directly to the DAO to propose they facilitate a workstream and get paid for it without facilitation by the OpCo. However, if the proposed scope of work falls within OpCo\u2019s mandate, it is expected that delegates vote against such a proposal if it can be better executed via OpCo\u2019s involvement. Proposers will be encouraged to engage with OpCo before posting a proposal to the forum to align with the DAO-adjacent entity\u2019s internal employees. OpCo\u2019s internal employees will also proactively communicate with proposal authors and facilitators outside of OpCo such that there is no overlap between deliverables and the future plans for all initiatives are clear.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s crucial to mention that the introduction of a DAO-adjacent legal entity carries risks and burdens that shouldn\u2019t be ignored. Among other things, it requires some trust in a select group of facilitators as they are responsible for hiring and procuring the correct contributors as well as operationalizing and managing the DAO-adjacent entity, OpCo\u2019s setup and fixed costs are quite notable, and some amount of administrative work is required that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have arisen.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## OpCo Operational Process\n\nWe expect the general workflow for OpCo to be as follows:\n\n* A forum discussion is initiated, with the owner of that discussion having communicated with OpCo and defined whether the covered subject falls within OpCo\u2019s initial mandate, i.e., the Financial Management or Ecosystem Support verticals.\n* For verticals that are included in OpCo\u2019s mandate, a discussion could broadly take one of the following forms:\n  * A new key objective is introduced, but the roadmap to achieve that objective is unclear: Delegates have the option to create a Snapshot proposal to direct OpCo to produce an onchain proposal that defines the strategy to achieve the key objective(s), whether the entity would procure a facilitator or hire/operationalize an internal employee, as well as any funds needed to cover the strategy\u2019s expenses, excluding OpCo\u2019s internal employee costs. If approved, OpCo would begin facilitating the proposal created by itself. It\u2019s important to note that OpCo, together with its oversight committee (OAT), is responsible for keeping the DAO informed about the entity\u2019s bandwidth. They\u2019ll also provide updates on when current projects are expected to end. This ensures that if there is a sudden spike in new proposals, especially complex and more time-intensive ones, delegates can prioritize and vote on the ones OpCo can take on.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, but the incentive program\u2019s structure and size are unclear. A proposal is passed for OpCo to operationalize internal employees and create the exact strategy. OpCo then defines, e.g., the amount of incentives to be distributed, what the application process to receive incentives looks like, how success will be measured, etc. A proposal to ratify the strategy, the incentives to be distributed, and the required workforce is then created. If passed, OpCo will activate the needed facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) and strategy execution begins.\n  * A new key objective is introduced and the roadmap to achieve that objective is clear: Delegates approve an onchain proposal that defines the strategy, whether the facilitator is the proposer, proposer-related party, an internal OpCo employee, or someone the OpCo procures, and the related expenses excluding facilitator fees for internal OpCo employees, after which strategy execution begins. If a proposal introduces a new key objective with a clear roadmap but that roadmap is ambitious, the OAT together with OpCo should signal how feasible it is for the entity to execute the proposal. If it\u2019s determined that such a roadmap is feasible, the OAT together with OpCo would also communicate whether or not the entity needs more internal resources to be able to execute.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, and the structure and size are clear. An onchain proposal to ratify the strategy, the facilitators, and the capital needed is then created. If passed, the required facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) are contracted by OpCo, or OpCo operationalizes/hires internal employees, depending on the DAO\u2019s decision, and the strategy is activated.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n* Proposals and their execution can still be DAO-led end-to-end and outside of OpCo if delegates vote in this regard. OpCo is a tool for the DAO to leverage if needed.\n* The DAO-adjacent entity is required to be proactive, meaning that internal employees need to actively give feedback in the forums and participate in opinionated discussions.\n* Furthermore, if OpCo has available bandwidth, it should identify areas within its mandated verticals where improvements could be made. If there is no clear owner for such areas and addressing them would benefit the DAO, OpCo should take action. OpCo can create a proposal to define the strategy for addressing the targeted area, requesting funds to cover expenses, excluding costs for OpCo\u2019s internal employees and other related operating expenses, and authorizing the DAO-adjacent entity to operationalize facilitators to execute the strategy.\n\nOpCo\u2019s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity\u2019s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo\u2019s oversight committee. After OpCo\u2019s core team has been hired, the entity has demonstrated product-market fit and readiness to execute according to its complete mandate, OpCo could be leveraged to help develop a DAO-wide budget, in which case the DAO-adjacent entity could hold the budgeted capital for at least the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management categories. In this case, when proposals related to these verticals are passed, no capital would have to be moved from the treasury as OpCo would be able to cover all expenses from its holdings.\n\n## Establishing OpCo\n\nExploratory work on OpCo\u2019s legal structure has already been initiated, but further effort and consultation with key stakeholders, delegates, legal parties, and the Arbitrum Foundation are needed to hammer down the exact structure. Any costs incurred by the Foundation for setting up the legal structure would be reimbursed from capital allocated to this initiative if this proposal were to pass.\n\nOpCo\u2019s initial term will tentatively be 30 months (around 6 months for setup and 24 months for operations from the entity\u2019s official initiation date). The initial term\u2019s length has been chosen to allow ample time for any unforeseen delays in establishing the legal entity, ramping up and stabilizing its operations, and will enable OpCo to focus on more complex and long-term strategies and internalize top talent as a longer initial term provides predictability/job security for employees. Once the first term is coming to an end, the executive-equivalent internal personnel together with OpCo\u2019s oversight committee\u2014the Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT), introduced below\u2014are required to collaborate to create the continuation proposal for the DAO-adjacent entity. This is expected to cover, among other things, the second OpCo term\u2019s length, the required budget, and any changes or improvements that should be made. It should be noted that if OpCo is required to internalize a vast amount of facilitator roles before a DAO-wide budget is put in place, OpCo might have to create a proposal that would allocate additional funds as its initial exemplary budget has been constructed to cover up to 12 internal full-time employees at different salaries.\n\nTo enable OpCo to successfully fulfill its mandate, the entity should, among other things, have the following initial operational capabilities, internal employees, and resources:\n\n* Internal Finances, Financial Rails, and Controls\n  * Appoint an external accounting and audit firm to maintain financial records and create yearly audits of financial statements and internal controls.\n  * Banking capabilities to be able to convert stablecoins into fiat currency and pay service providers not accepting tokens.\n* Legal\n  * Hire a full-time, in-house legal counsel.\n  * Obtain the required insurances that cover the DAO-adjacent entity as well as internal employees and the OAT.\n* Business-Critical Software\n  * Acquire any needed collaboration and communication tools, accounting and financial management software, human resources management systems, etc.\n* Internal Executive-Equivalent Employees\n  * Chief Chaos Coordinator\n    * Ensures that OpCo has the required internal resources, employees, and contracted service providers such that the DAO-adjacent entity can operate properly and execute strategies mandated by the DAO.\n    * Responsible for building and advancing the entity\u2019s operational structure and managing workflows as initiatives are rolled into the organization and new focus areas are introduced.\n    * Similarly to other executive-equivalent personnel, accountable for adequate record keeping and internal controls.\n    * Collaborates with any other executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT to produce bi-annual oversight and financial reports.\n    * Together with executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT, in charge of creating the continuation proposal for OpCo\u2019s next term.\n  * Chief of Coins\n    * Works with the relevant parties to produce a detailed, actual budget for OpCo, ratified by the OAT and the DAO. In the future, we expect the Chief of Coins to help facilitate a DAO-wide budget together with the relevant parties.\n    * Before a DAO-wide budget is created, responsible for requesting additional funds to ensure the entity\u2019s operations if capital allocated for OpCo\u2019s OpEx is close to being depleted.\n    * Verifies that allocated funds are custodied in a secure manner and utilized as intended.\n    * Makes sure that the OAT and the DAO have required visibility into ongoing expenses, how financials are expected to develop, and any other relevant considerations.\n    * Monitors Arbitrum\u2019s financial performance and makes new recommendations based on this information.\n    * Closely collaborates with entities and individuals responsible for treasury management-related tasks, enabling the creation of a unified asset allocation and risk diversification strategy in line with the DAO\u2019s vision, mission, and purpose.\n    * Manages accounting, payroll, and payment infrastructure.\n\n## OpCo KPIs & 12-Month Deliverables\n\nWe are looking for community feedback on this front, but some potential, apparent KPIs for OpCo (h/t\u00a0[@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3)\u00a0for most of these) include:\n\n* Talent Acquisition, Service Provider Selection, and Program Management\n  * Decrease in time-to-hire, compared to the DAO\u2019s previous structure\n  * Employee engagement and satisfaction\n  * Retention rate\n  * Share of service providers meeting or exceeding performance metrics\n  * Cost savings or added value generated\n  * Diversity of service providers engaged\n* Ecosystem Coordination\n  * Time to solve open questions and other ambiguities\n  * Number of initiatives facilitated and their success\n  * Level of community engagement and stakeholder satisfaction\n  * Agility in adapting objectives\n  * Share of OpCo-initiated strategies accepted by the DAO\n* Performance Tracking and Transparency\n  * Timeliness of oversight and financial reports\n  * Share of data and metrics made publicly available\n  * Community engagement with reports\n\nUltimately, the OAT will be responsible for designing, finalizing, and implementing the relevant KPIs once OpCo is at a point where this can be sufficiently done. We envision that this will be a collaborative effort between the OAT and the DAO, with KPIs reviewed and adjusted periodically based on how OpCo evolves and the community\u2019s feedback.\n\nThe two primary, immediate priorities for OpCo should be regarded as follows:\n\n1. Establishing the legal entity\n2. Implementing robust and qualified oversight capabilities (mainly the Oversight and Transparency Committee)\n\nOnce these two components have been achieved, the entity is prepared so that when the OAT and Foundation find the perfect initial employees for OpCo, it will be ready to begin servicing the DAO\u2019s needs, although it will take some additional time for OpCo to ramp up to full capacity. It is important to note that the DAO should not optimize for rushing OpCo to full capacity versus optimizing to have it available for when the OAT finds the right person and the DAO needs it most.\n\nIn the twelve months following OpCo\u2019s official initiation date (i.e., when, among other things, the entity, structure, and initial staffing have been finalized), the entity is expected to achieve the following tasks at minimum, given the DAO still finds them relevant and supports their facilitation by OpCo in the future:\n\n* Establish adequate processes, capabilities, internal controls, and any other relevant functions such that the entity is ready to assume/create contracts with service providers, take on admin work where required, do adequate reporting, and manage new initiatives end-to-end on behalf of the DAO (KYC, payments, etc.)\n* Set up regular touch-points with Arbitrum Stakeholders (delegates, OCL, the Foundation, etc.)\n* Consolidate the TM V1.2 and STEP initiatives into a cohesive strategy that is facilitated with the help of the entity.\n* Given the Watchdog program is ratified through the governance process, absorb the management of the program.\n* Given the SOS framework is ratified through the governance process, manage the subsequent review/ad hoc strategic objective adjustment processes, potentially replacing the research member of the ARDC in creating quarterly reports updating the DAO on the process made with respect to the chosen objectives if delegates so choose.\n* Together with the Foundation, formulate a synergistic plan for DAO communications (internal and external), branding, and marketing, as well as hire personnel/contract vendors if required.\n* Absorb the Events Budget initiative and formulate/manage an events strategy for the DAO, again, working together with the Foundation.\n* Design and implement a financials and deliverables (whether programs are developing in line with what was initially expected/communicated) reporting structure for all relevant DAO programs.\n\n## OpCo Accountability \u2013 The Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT)\n\nThe OAT is a group of five individuals with the primary mandate to oversee OpCo\u2019s operations, ensure the DAO maintains transparency into the DAO-adjacent entity, function as the coordinator between the DAO and OpCo, and establish clear communication channels with the other committees overseeing the separate DAO-adjacent entities such as the GCP and possibly the CapCo in the future should the DAO vote accordingly. More specifically, the OAT\u2019s responsibilities include but are not limited to:\n\n* Accountability: Ensures that OpCo is not overstepping its mandate, over-hiring doesn\u2019t take place, and execution is constrained solely to strategies approved by the DAO. Holds the executive-equivalent personnel accountable, helps produce and approves bi-annual oversight and financial reports, designs relevant KPIs for OpCo once the entity is at a point where this can be sufficiently done, and gives other quarterly updates to the community (such as how OpCo is progressing towards the KPIs designed by the OAT, any operational developments, etc.), reviews all relevant internal materials, and monitors that funds held in OpCo-related wallets are used correctly.\n* Operational Support: Provides assistance in the entity\u2019s legal setup process, gives guidance on OpCo\u2019s operational development, assists the executive-equivalent personnel in producing a continuation proposal for OpCo, and continuously guides OpCo-related contributors to align with the DAO\u2019s will.\n* Hiring, Termination, & Authorization: The OAT, in collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, would hire the executive-equivalent personnel to the OpCo (the Chief Chaos Coordinator, the Chief of Coins, and any other positions of equivalent responsibility that may be introduced in the future) once the legal entity is established. The OAT will help onboard the executive-equivalent personnel and assist in the creation of a standardized onboarding process for future internal employees such that new hires\u2019 expectations are managed properly. Once the first internal employees are hired, the OAT would act as the approving authority when OpCo enters into contracts with service providers or individual contributors, as well as greenlight salaries, larger spends, expenses, and budgets, having the authority to challenge decisions made within OpCo that may have a material, negative impact. Moreover, the OAT would be empowered to terminate service provider/individual contributor/etc. contracts as well as fire OpCo\u2019s internal staff. If the OAT decides to take such an action, the concerned party will be suspended from their duties, and payments will be halted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Removal of OAT Members: OAT Members may be removed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a violation of a conflict of interest or other OpCo policies. In the event of a violation: (A) an OAT Member may call up an internal vote for removal with a memo detailing the alleged violation; (B) for a vote to remove an OAT Member to pass, it must have at least 4 out of the 5 OAT Members voting in favor; and (C) the Arbitrum DAO may also call for a vote to remove OAT Members at any time pursuant to a Temperature Check vote in accordance with the quorum and voting threshold requirements of a Temperature Check. The OpCo Team has the ability to call for a Temperature Check vote to remove an OAT Member as voted upon by the Arbitrum DAO. (i) The OpCo Team member may flag to another OpCo Team member that an election to remove an OAT Member via a Temperature Check vote is warranted; (ii) If such other OpCo Team member considers the request for removal to be warranted, then the OpCo Team member who originally made the flag may call for a removal election (subject to a 3 day feedback period, followed by a 7 day voting period) as a Temperature Check vote; (iii) In the event that a call to remove fails, the OpCo Team member who called for such Temperature Check vote cannot call another vote for removal for a period of 3 months. The process for electing a replacement for a removed OAT member will be equivalent to how the removed member was elected. I.e., if the removed member was elected through a DAO vote, the replacement member will be elected through a DAO vote. If the removed member was elected by the OAT, the OAT will elect the replacement member. A removed OAT member cannot be reappointed to the OAT. Further details on the OAT election process are given below.\n* Coordination: Actively engage with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to align on deliverables and serve as the liaison between delegates, key stakeholders, the wider DAO, and other DAO-adjacent entities\u2019 oversight committees. The OAT will also initiate a monthly OpCo oversight call for community members to get updates on the most recent developments and for them to have the opportunity to make inquiries. A separate forum section will be created for OpCo.\n\n## OAT Election Process\n\nIf this proposal were to pass the onchain voting stage, the formation of the Oversight and Transparency Committee would commence. The DAO would elect 3 individuals to the OAT, with these individuals then promptly appointing 2 additional members with specialized skill sets to ensure all Arbitrum stakeholders\u2019 interests are represented and the OAT\u2019s proficiencies are varied and complete. Additionally, the Arbitrum Foundation will be given an observing and non-voting sixth seat on the OAT similar to the GCP. OAT members are expected to be able to contribute at least 10 hours per week to OAT-related tasks.\n\nOAT applicants are required to apply as individuals to increase accountability. Applicants are required to disclose any current or possible future conflicts of interest in their applications, including but not limited to financial, personal, and professional. Applicants are also required to disclose all active contributor roles and payment streams related to the Arbitrum DAO that they, and entities that they have a professional or financial relationship with, have and are receiving. The application process for the 3 DAO-elected members would be initiated soon after the OpCo proposal passes an onchain vote and would run for ~3 weeks. Note that the application period can be extended if the size of the applicant pool is limited. A shutterized, weighted voting system will be utilized on Snapshot, and the 3 applicants with the most votes will be chosen as members of the OAT. The DAO-elected members should then prioritize appointing 2 additional members (required to be individuals as well). The 2 additional members don\u2019t have to be appointed at the same time. The additional members will be added to the OAT optimistically, with the DAO having the ability to reject either/both of the additional members through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d). All members will serve until the end of the first OAT term unless removed or they resign.\n\nWhile the same internal OpCo employees as well as contracted service providers and individual contributors will continue in their roles across OpCo\u2019s terms if the DAO-adjacent entity is extended in the future, the OAT\u2019s term is 12 months, with a re-election process initiated when the OAT\u2019s term has around 3 months left. The DAO would again choose 3 members who then appoint 2 additional members. If the new cohort is different from the previous one, the previous OAT members are expected to help onboard the new members when the term is coming to an end. There are no consecutive term limits for OAT members. As the OAT is mandated to assist in OpCo\u2019s setup process, the first OAT term will be slightly longer than subsequent ones since it will include the period from when the initial OAT members are selected to the establishment of the entity, plus 12 months from the entity\u2019s official start date.\n\nAny individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-obseving seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative\u2019s or DAO-adjacent entity\u2019s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\n## OAT Applicant Requirements\n\nApplicants must be individuals, not entities, and should possess familiarity with the Arbitrum DAO, governance processes, multisig operations, and a strong industry reputation. Additionally, candidates should demonstrate substantial experience and expertise in one or more of the following fields:\n\n1. Corporate Finance & Financial Management\n   * Treasury Management\n   * Finance / Accounting / Budgeting\n2. Operations & Strategy\n   * (DAO) Operations / Business Development / Growth / Strategy\n   * Procurement / HR / People\n   * Crypto Law / Compliance\n\nWhen applying to become an OAT member, applicants should specify the primary domain(s) from the list above in which they have the most experience and describe the nature of that experience. More details about candidates\u2019 desired skill sets and professional experience, as well as an application template, will be posted by Entropy Advisors if the onchain vote to signal approval of OpCo passes.\n\n## OAT Compensation Structure\n\nOAT members must be properly compensated, highly incentivized to commit their full attention to the outlined responsibilities, and aligned with Arbitrum DAO\u2019s long-term success. OAT members\u2019 base monthly payment is $7.5K (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation in its role as an observer). An additional 1M ARB vesting bonus payment will be allocated to OAT members (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation in its role as an observer) to ensure long-term alignment and fair compensation. At the end of the first OAT term, 50% of this ARB would be sent to a vesting contract that would release the funds after a 24-month cliff following the first OAT term\u2019s end. Each individual who is an active member when the OAT term ends and was appointed as part of the dedicated election process will be allocated an equal share of the funds (100K ARB). If an OAT member steps down or is removed, they become ineligible for the bonus, in which case that ARB would be allocated pro rata to the replacing member. For example, if the initial OAT term\u2019s length is 14 months and a replacement member is appointed with 7 months remaining in the initial term, they would be eligible to receive a bonus of 50K ARB subject to the same vesting terms as outlined above. The other 500K ARB will be allocated in a similar manner as described above for the second OAT term.\n\n## Governance and Compliance Requirements for OpCo, its Internal Employees, and the OAT\n\nThe non-exhaustive list of governance and compliance obligations for OpCo, its internal employees, and OAT members comprises:\n\n* Bound to be aligned with the community values listed in The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO, be committed to prioritizing the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s needs, and act in absolute good faith and utmost honesty to fulfill their duties to the best of their abilities.\n* Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n* Have to go through a KYC process and enter into an Agreement with the OpCo legal entity. The Agreement will cover, including but not limited to, appointment, conflict of interest, mandate, confidentiality, record-keeping, duty of impartiality, recusal, self-dealing prohibition, and ethical trading standards.\n* Required to sign any relevant non-disclosure agreements with respect to confidential information they might gain access to as part of their duties.\n* Bound to follow the Code of Conduct for delegates.\n* Internal full-time employees (not OAT members): these individuals, as well as any companies and analogous entities with which these individuals maintain a professional or financial relationship, are forbidden from participating in Arbitrum DAO governance votes.\n* OpCo in its capacity as a legal entity: the entity is prohibited from becoming a delegate and cannot assume token delegations.\n\n## OpCo Financials and Costs\n\nOpCo\u2019s budget is intended to fund its initial 30-month term, with funds covering the entity\u2019s legal setup, any outsourced professional services required for operations such as legal counsel and accounting/auditing services, other incurred operating expenses such as business-critical software and insurance, internal full-time employee salaries, and the OAT\u2019s salaries.\n\nThis proposal would earmark 30M ARB to cover OpCo\u2019s initial term, with an exemplary budget breakdown shown below. This is not an official budget, meaning that capital may be budgeted and allocated differently once the entity is stood up. For example, Employee\u00a0#4\u00a0doesn\u2019t have to be hired at a yearly salary of ~$130K. The exemplary budget\u2019s purpose is instead to showcase that the ask isn\u2019t arbitrary, and how the figure has been derived. It\u2019s also important to note that several line items, such as entity setup and legal services are notably larger than what the actual expenses are expected to be. This was done to account for any unforeseen events or worst-case scenarios which could require notable capital commitments.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"387\" width=\"690\" alt=\"OpCo Exemplary Budget\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/892e776d01c06f75b574ea7361591b03cde22a7a_2_690x387.jpeg\" />OpCo Exemplary Budget1920\u00d71079 232 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/892e776d01c06f75b574ea7361591b03cde22a7a.jpeg \"OpCo Exemplary Budget\")\n\n\n\nFunds will be transferred to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled address, with 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo\u2019s oversight committee. Again, if bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees\u2019 payouts additionally being performance-based. Of the remaining 26M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB\u2019s price of $0.68 as of January 21, this would require roughly 18M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following this proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact. After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 30M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\nOf the $12M worth of cash equivalents, $2.5M will be released upfront. Once OpCo\u2019s legal setup and related aspects are finalized, the entity can draw up to $500K each month. If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds. If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\nResidual ARB (as well as capital in other denominations) will be sent back to the DAO treasury at the end of OpCo\u2019s first term if the initiative isn\u2019t renewed. Otherwise, the budget will be rolled over. ARB associated with this initiative, held by OpCo or the Arbitrum Foundation, is prohibited from being used in governance and must be delegated to the Exclude Address wherever practicable such that these funds don\u2019t count towards the quorum. The Chief of Coins, together with relevant parties, will be responsible for maintaining an adequate runway for covering expenses as well as establishing a low-risk management strategy for idle capital to enhance the impact of the allocated funds.\n\nThe DAO will have the capability to clawback OpCo\u2019s funding at any time. Defunding OpCo entirely by the DAO requires a forum post outlining the rationale behind the request for change, allowing for a reasonable time for discussion, and a subsequent Temperature Check vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d). If a Snapshot vote to defund OpCo is passed, payments will immediately be halted and all earmarked funds returned to the DAO Treasury, with OpCo ceasing operations.\n\n# Voting Structure\n\nThe vote will utilize Basic Voting:\n\n* FOR: Establish OpCo.\n* AGAINST: Do not establish OpCo.\n* ABSTAIN\n\n# Timeline\n\n1. October 30 - December 12, 2024: OpCo forum period requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions.\n2. December 12 - December 19, 2024: Snapshot to signal approval/disapproval of OpCo, with the clear majority voting FOR.\n3. January 7 - January 22, 2025: Hold a community call to gather the last round of feedback and make final edits.\n4. \\~ January 30 - February 13, 2025: Tally proposal to fund OpCo. Capital will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled address.\n5. \\~21 days: Application period for the 3 DAO-elected OAT members. Entropy Advisors will handle application template creation and will be ready to post after the above Tally vote is complete. It is worth noting that if at least 3 suitably qualified individuals do not apply within the ~3 weeks, this application period may be extended. These are critical contributors to the DAO\u2019s operations, and the process of finding the right candidates should not be rushed.\n6. 7 days: Snapshot to elect the 3 OAT members. Once chosen, the 3 members will KYC with the Foundation, sign any required NDAs, and begin searching for the 2 additional members, who will also go through a similar KYC process and sign the required NDAs (all OAT members will sign a contract with OpCo once the legal entity is finalized). After all OAT members are KYCd and the required NDAs have been signed, they will begin the recruitment process for the Chief Chaos Coordinator and Chief of Coins.\n7. TBD: When the legal entity is finalized and the required internal employees have been contracted, OpCo will begin operationalizing and executing according to its mandate."

    "description": "# [Constitutional] AIP: Activate ArbOS 51 (Dia) and Gas Pricing Updates\n**Type:**\u00a0Constitutional AIP\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP proposes the activation of ArbOS 51: Dia on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova as well as increases to the gas target and min L2 base fee, along with changes to the L2 pricing algorithm. This on-chain vote proposes to bundle together the following two temperature check votes:\n\n1. [<u>AIP: ArbOS 51 Version 51 Dia</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x33754da4006d0ef38666ec5d5e85fd0966a891a594ab9dc21f23beedea2d330b): which contains relevant Fusaka EIPs, the addition of a MaxTxGasLimit allowing full block utilization, changes to instrument Nitro\u2019s State Transition Function (STF) to price gas based on specific resource usage, native token mint/burn capabilities, and a few bug fixes.\u00a0\n2. [<u>AIP: Raise the gas target, implement improvements to the pricing algorithm, and raise the L2 min base fee</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4a96a91d162975de0d402b83ca8b8a24e808ca357150120fc0d44ae0bf1cc4a5)\n\nThe combination of ArbOS 51 and the gas-target/pricing updates will ship as a single integrated release, designated ArbOS 51, which supersedes the originally planned standalone activation of ArbOS 50.\n\nSince the ArbitrumDAO has already signaled support for the adoption of the above two AIPs in their respective temperature check votes, this on-chain vote will bundle both of these AIPs for activation on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova with the ArbOS 51 release. Please visit the forum posts for each of the AIPs to learn more.\n\nThe ArbOS 51 release builds upon ArbOS 40 Callisto and will be shipped as a new mandatory Nitro release and new versions of the rollup contracts for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, should the ArbitrumDAO vote to pass this proposal. This proposal increments the ArbOS version number to 5x instead of 4x due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability, as explained[ <u>here</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/arbos-upgrade#step-3-schedule-the-arbos-version-upgrade).\n\nThis proposal only concerns the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains, as these two chains are governed by the ArbitrumDAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be interpreted as Arbitrum\u2019s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject[ <u>here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\n## **Changes Included**\n\n### **1.**\u00a0 [\u00a0**<u>Activation of ArbOS 51 Dia</u>**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-arbos-version-50-dia/29835)\n\nArbOS 51 Dia enables full Fusaka compatibility while introducing native Arbitrum improvements. Visit the original[ <u>Forum Post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-arbos-version-50-dia/29835) to read more details about the proposed changes. Key components include of this ArbOS 51 release include:\n\n* [<u>EIP-7951</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7951): Precompile for secp256r1 Curve Support\n* [<u>EIP-7825</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7825): Transaction Gas Limit Cap\n* [<u>EIP-7642</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7642): eth/69 - history expiry and simpler receipts\n* [<u>EIP-7939</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7939): Count leading zeros (CLZ) opcode\n* [<u>EIP-7823</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7823): Set upper bounds for MODEXP\n* [<u>EIP-7883</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7883): ModExp Gas Cost Increase\n* [<u>EIP-7910</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7910): eth\\_config JSON-RPC Method\n* Enable[ <u>EIP-2537</u>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537): Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations\n* Introduce an \u201cEffective Block Gas Limit\u201d in the STF, with a MaxTxGasLimit of 32M gas. The total Effective Block Gas Limit becomes 64M gas (MaxTxGasLimit + MaxBlockGasLimit). This doesn\u2019t change the GasTarget or overall gas per second, only how gas is distributed across blocks.\n* Instrumentation of the State Transition Function (STF) to track transaction gas consumption across multiple resource types, rather than a single total based on opcodes, including: computation, storage growth, storage access, history growth, and calldata. This work lays the foundation for dynamic, resource-based pricing where fees can adjust based on the most constrained resource on the network and represent one part of Arbitrum\u2019s scaling strategy for lower, more stable fees as demand grows.This[ <u>explainer blog</u>](https://blog.arbitrum.io/dynamic-pricing-explainer/) and[ <u>Vitalik\u2019s post on Multidimensional gas pricing</u>](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/05/09/multidim.html) are great resources to learn more about this approach to improving how the EVM prices network resource usage.\n* Native token mint/burn to allow an Arbitrum chain to delegate minting and burning of its native gas token to a trusted bridge provider. Native Token Mint/Burn is proposed to be included in ArbOS 51 Dia for the benefit of Arbitrum Orbit chains (reducing the need for forks) and to streamline development and testing into a single codebase. There are no plans to enable this feature on Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova,\\*\\*\\*\\* consequently this feature will be explicitly left disabled for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.

Therefore, an increase in Ethereum block\u2019s size limit does not need to be replicated or matched with an increase in Arbitrum block size limit.\n\n### **2.**\u00a0 [\u00a0**<u>Raising the gas target, increasing the min L2 base fee, & improving the pricing algorithm</u>**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-raise-the-gas-target-implement-improvements-to-the-pricing-algorithm/30182)\n\nAs part of our strategy for scaling Arbitrum technology, this proposal includes the AIP to improve the pricing algorithm for Arbitrum One and Nova to reduce the severity, frequency, and duration of high L2 gas prices during periods of elevated demand on the network. Concretely, the proposed changes are to:\n\n* Replace the current single gas target and single adjustment window, with a new model that employs multiple (higher) gas targets, measured over multiple adjustment windows,\n* Raise the long term effective gas target, up from today\u2019s single gas target of 7 Mgas/s (up to a maximum of 100 Mgas/s),\n* Grant Offchain Labs, in its role as an Arbitrum Aligned Entity, the permission to make additional changes gradually to scale the chain sustainably, and\n* Increase the minimum L2 base fee from 0.01 gwei per gas to 0.02 gwei per gas.\n\nThe rationale for this change, alongside details on the specifications and supporting data, can be found[ <u>here in the original AIP</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-raise-the-gas-target-implement-improvements-to-the-pricing-algorithm/30182).\n\n## **Implementation Details**\n\nAll of the above changes are implemented in a release of Arbitrum Nitro and will be shipped via two separate upgrades: a Nitro node version upgrade and an update with the on-chain rollup contracts on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Should this proposal pass, the payload will be executed on-chain and will include the relevant on-chain contract changes, updating the WASM module root, and scheduling of the ArbOS upgrade. The proposed payload changes assume that the Nitro node software for all node operators and validators for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova are updated to a version that supports ArbOS 51.\n\n**Audit reports**\n\nAn independent, third-party audit by Trail of Bits has been completed and the results from the audit can be found below:\n\n* [<u>https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports)\n\n**Proposal payload activation details and dates**\n\nNote that should this vote pass, the proposal payload[ <u>here</u>](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/366) will trigger the activation of ArbOS 51 at epoch timestamp 17:00:00 UTC on Thursday, January 8, 2026, which is the last step in the implementation process for Constitutional AIPs, as outlined[ <u>here</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal). This specific date was chosen so that large, complex upgrades (like ArbOS upgrades) can be done so when members from the Arbitrum Foundation, Offchain Labs, and ArbitrumDAO Security Council, are available to assist if necessary.\n\n**Verifying the ArbOS 51 code difference**\n\n[<u>Click here</u>](https://arbitrum.notion.site/Verifying-the-ArbOS-50-Code-Difference-2a501a3f59f8804cb0a0f9a460020a9d)\n\n## **Implementation Steps**\n\n1. **\\[Completed] Forum Proposals and Snapshot Votes**: The included proposals for this vote were initially posted on the ArbitrumDAO forums[ <u>here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-arbos-version-50-dia/29835) and[ <u>here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-raise-the-gas-target-implement-improvements-to-the-pricing-algorithm/30182).

    "description": "# Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks funding from the Arbitrum DAO to support an Attackathon, a large-scale security audit event hosted by the Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi. The Attackathon will focus on securing the Ethereum protocol with three key phases: education, active bug hunting, and result evaluation. The initiative aims to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation. This effort is crucial for ensuring Ethereum\u2019s stability, which is vital to maintaining the reliability of projects on Arbitrum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs a Layer 2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum is directly dependent on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Given that Arbitrum is EVM-compatible, any vulnerabilities in Ethereum could potentially impact Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem. This Attackathon is particularly timely given the recent major Ethereum hard forks, which have introduced new code that requires careful auditing.\n\nAdditionally, the Attackathon will include an educational program featuring live technical walkthroughs and detailed documentation from Ethereum Foundation, client teams, Solidity developers, and Immunefi. This program will cater to security researchers at all levels, helping to build a stronger security community around both Ethereum and Arbitrum. The increased awareness and participation in Ethereum\u2019s security will ultimately benefit Arbitrum by ensuring a more secure underlying infrastructure.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Attackathon aligns with Arbitrum\u2019s mission to support a secure and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. By contributing to this initiative, Arbitrum will directly enhance Ethereum\u2019s security, which supports the reliability of Arbitrum. Moreover, the educational component will upskill security researchers, giving them the tools to audit and secure both the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum will benefit from increased visibility as a proactive participant in Ethereum security efforts, enhancing its credibility and reputation among developers, users, and security researchers. By sponsoring the Attackathon, Arbitrum positions itself as a leader in the ecosystem, contributing to long-term sustainability and security.\n\n## Detailed Financial Justification\n\nThe goal of securing $2M in total funding aligns with other major security audits in the blockchain ecosystem. Comparable initiatives include:\n\n* MakerDAO contest on Sherlock: $1.35M\n* Euler contest on Cantina: $1.25M\n* Uniswap v4 contest on Cantina: $2.35M\n* Firedancer contest on Immunefi: $1M\n\nThe Attackathon funding goal reflects the importance of thoroughly securing Ethereum\u2019s core protocol. With $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation, additional sponsorship from Arbitrum DAO will help us reach this $2M target, ensuring participation from top-tier security researchers and maximizing the event\u2019s impact.\n\n## Outcome Metrics\n\nBy setting clear goals for participation, reports submitted, and transparency, we can effectively track the impact of the Attackathon. Key outcome metrics include:\n\n* Secure over 100 security researcher signups before the program's launch.\n* Achieve participation from over 100 distinct individuals submitting reports.\n* Submit more than 150 reports by the conclusion of the Attackathon.\n* Publish an audit-style report summarizing findings for the Arbitrum and Ethereum communities.\n\nThese metrics will demonstrate the program's effectiveness in attracting top security talent and identifying critical vulnerabilities across both ecosystems.\n\n## Community Feedback Loop\n\nTo ensure transparency and alignment with community expectations, we will provide regular updates on the Attackathon\u2019s progress through Arbitrum forums and governance channels. These updates will include detailed reports on fund usage, security vulnerabilities identified, and overall outcomes. Community feedback will be encouraged through these platforms to maintain alignment with the community\u2019s goals and priorities.\n\n## Breakdown of Expenditures\n\n100% of the funds raised from Arbitrum and other sponsors will be allocated to security researcher payouts based on the severity of the bugs they find. Immunefi has waived their usual fees for this event, so all funds will be directly used for researcher rewards. If any funds remain after the Attackathon, they will be rolled over to an audit contest focused on securing the Pecta hardfork.\n\n## Estimated Timeline\n\n* **November 20**: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff\n* **November 27**: Attackathon hunting begins\n* **January 22**: Attackathon concludes and results compilation begins\n* **January 23**: Review period begins\n* **Late March**: Results announced\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is invited to sponsor the Attackathon with a **$100,000 USD commitment**, payable in ETH, ARB, or USDC. This sponsorship includes:\n\n* 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\n* Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page\n* Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\n* An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program\n* 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\nBy supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum will leverage the event\u2019s findings to ensure its network remains secure and robust. This initiative not only enhances security but also demonstrates Arbitrum\u2019s commitment to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n## Multi-Sig Address for DAO Deposit\n\nTo deposit the funds, the Arbitrum DAO can use the following multi-sig address:\n**0x022ec7543BfB377BbEB6676E5ba5Ecf3950dA889**"

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router\n### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings ([https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi/)). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings ([https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/)), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem\u2019s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won\u2019t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS \u2013 Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS \u2013 Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at\u00a0[https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/))\n\n* USDS address on Ethereum -\u00a0[https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F)\n* sUSDS address on Ethereum -\u00a0[https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum -\u00a0[https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum -\u00a0[https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793)\n* Official USDS address on Arbitrum -\u00a0[https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b)\n* Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum -\u00a0[https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610)\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity\\_MakerDAO\\_Arbitrum\\_Token\\_Bridge\\_audit.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf)\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora)\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

During this period, we will deliver strategic proposals, guide key partners through the DAO processes, and align the priorities of essential stakeholders for the betterment of Arbitrum. We will also expand our efforts to include a small set of additional verticals by hiring skilled contributors in areas where the DAO needs support, such as data analytics, technical proposal creation, marketing, or any other needs that may arise.\n\nWith a budget of $2.47M for the year paid in monthly installments and stored with the Foundation for DAO-clawback capabilities, along with an optional up to 1.5 million ARB for performance-based bonuses voted on by the DAO near the end of the term and put in a 3-year vesting contact to ensure long-term alignment, we will continue to build a dedicated team focused solely on enhancing the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s success. The primary goal of our work is to help Arbitrum DAO continue its path toward efficient and effective operations and execute its long-term vision of becoming a sustainable entity with diversified revenue streams. We believe that over the coming years, Arbitrum DAO has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year while maintaining its status as the leading Ethereum scaling solution with an ever-growing base of users and developers. All of Entropy Advisors\u2019 employees will work full-time towards achieving this goal.\n\n# Motivation and Rationale\n\nArbitrum DAO is set up to prosper with its cutting-edge technology stack that will soon support numerous coding languages, a vibrant community of users and developers, abundant resources in the DAO treasury, and the ecosystem\u2019s commitment to scaling the most decentralized and secure L2 on Ethereum. Despite our belief that Arbitrum holds a strong position in the market today, there is a lot of work to be done over the next 3-5 years to ensure Arbitrum maintains and advances its position. We have diagnosed some key areas in need of improvement that we feel well suited to take on:\n\n1. **Designing, drafting and executing proposals that benefit Arbitrum.**\n2. **Strengthening overall governance processes and providing feedback to other DAO contributors, unlocking efficiencies and ensuring redundant work is avoided.**\n3. **Acting as a mesh layer between key stakeholders, e.g., active delegates, development teams such as Offchain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.**\n4. **Helping potential 3rd party strategic partners navigate the DAO to attract high-quality companies and individuals within the ecosystem and RFP applicant pools.**\n5. **Attracting/retaining top talent working full-time, professionally on behalf of Arbitrum DAO.**\n6. **Improving the ability of the DAO to spend money effectively and support a long term sustainable future for Arbitrum.**\n\nToday the Arbitrum DAO faces friction executing across all of the aforementioned tasks. Many times those creating proposals have known or unknown ulterior motives and incentives at play. It is difficult for aspiring contributors and partners to navigate the DAO. No one is incentivized to bolster RFP applicant pools. Communication is fragmented with no entity in place to tie perspectives together, and operations/goals often overlap across initiatives. There are numerous proposals that are consensus to move forward but do not progress because there is no financial incentive to do so. There is inadequate accountability over and transparency into DAO funded programs. The problems are ever-evolving and growing, and the Arbitrum DAO needs an entity that only has the DAO\u2019s best interests in mind to fill the gaps.\n\nOur team ([@swmartin19](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/swmartin19),\u00a0[@mattonchain](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mattonchain), and\u00a0[@pruitt](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/pruitt)) brings an extensive network as well as experience in research, governance, brand building, and project management to the Arbitrum DAO, having led well-known brands in the space such as Blockworks Research and 404 DAO. We have all been involved in the DAO since the beginning, starting with Blockworks Research\u2019s entry into the DAO by\u00a0[highlighting flaws\u00a0](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-1-arbitrum-improvement-proposal-framework/30/91)in the DAO\u2019s very first proposal, AIP-1. We are not afraid to push against the status quo if we believe it helps Arbitrum achieve its goals.\n\nEntropy Advisors was extremely fortunate to receive a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation. As such, we have been able to use the past few months contributing full-time to Arbitrum DAO to further showcase our value in the community. We have hosted bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls with a cohort of large delegates, with the foundation, and with OCL, and feel that we have a strong hold on various stakeholder\u2019s interests, strategic goals for Arbitrum, working initiatives, etc. When paired with our experience and networks within the industry, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help Arbitrum achieve its long-term goals with all stakeholder perspectives in mind. With exclusivity meaning no official or unofficial engagements with any other client, Entropy Advisors can serve Arbitrum DAO with no ulterior motives or conflicts of interest.\n\nToday, virtually no money is spent on operations, while the DAO has spent almost 435M ARB in total with ~95% going towards investments, incentives, and grants (Source: Delphi & R3gen). We believe it is absolutely imperative for the DAO to make an investment in operations, simultaneously ensuring different initiatives across the ecosystem can be set in motion swiftly, fit together seamlessly, and can reach the best talent, while the DAO\u2019s expenditures can be managed in a way that enables long-term sustainability. It is evident that this is becoming a wider-reaching theme within the DAO, but requires a heavy lift (see\u00a0[OpCo\u00a02](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737)\u00a0proposal from\u00a0@dkpremia\u00a0that asks for 25M ARB). We are NOT looking to replace OpCo, but rather drastically reduce the scope and funding request by helping formulate operational procedures until the OpCo is formally stood up. At that point, the DAO can decide what role Entropy Advisors plays as a service provider to the OpCo.\n\nWith the budget as outlined, Entropy will be able to hire up to 10 employees with a diverse range of skill sets including governance, data analytics, marketing, and development/engineering. We will be able to hire top talent in our industry who will dedicate their full-time bandwidth to Arbitrum DAO. Regardless of Arbitrum\u2019s current strategic priorities, whether cutting costs or scaling strategies, our team will work to execute the goals of the DAO. Given Arbitrum\u2019s dominance, size, and number of initiatives it is important that we build a well-rounded team at Entropy that can operate as the tip of the spear as a catalyst for change across the many sectors that the DAO operates.\n\n# Entropy\u2019s Portfolio\n\nAt the beginning of May, we\u00a0[introduced\u00a0](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-print-hello-world/23675/9)Entropy Advisors to the Arbitrum DAO. We are a governance operations-focused business, working exclusively with Arbitrum. Our initial efforts have already driven several notable initiatives, demonstrating our capability and commitment to enhancing the Arbitrum DAO:\n\n[<img height=\"478\" width=\"269\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96_2_269x478.jpeg\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96.jpeg)\n\n\n\n* Worked with\u00a0[@r3gen\\_Finance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/r3gen_finance)\u00a0to create a\u00a0[proposal\u00a01](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3d5ffb8e23b5f22f495f6460ef5ee8771efe5da5565dfa011917a78a2ec25916)\u00a0that reduces DAO OpEx on multi-sig signers, by establishing the Multisig Support Service.\n* We leveraged our network to ensure a competitive applicant pool, which ultimately resulted in one of the most\u00a0[competent applicant rosters](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss-nomination-thread/24773)\u00a0(40 in total) in the DAO\u2019s history despite just a $1,500-$2,500 monthly wage per signer.\n  * The proposal is expected to save the DAO almost $400,000 per year.\n  * Entropy managed the application process, and will soon host a call with the winning applicants to go over multi-sig best practices.\n* Conducted\u00a0[research](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730)\u00a0into Arbitrum DAO\u2019s sequencer margin / transaction fee mechanism, kicking off a conversation that aims to increase the DAO\u2019s treasury value rather than deplete it of resources.\n  * Attended/helped drive forward discussions related to DAO\u00a0[budgeting](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/call-to-discuss-the-creation-of-a-dao-budget/24802)\u00a0and sequencer\u00a0[revenue](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/call-to-discuss-arbitrums-fees-and-sequencer-revenue/24824)\u00a0through working group calls.\n  * Followed up with a formal\u00a0[proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adjusting-arbitrum-s-gas-fees/25002)\u00a0to increase the L2 minimum base fee on Arbitrum One, with plans to establish a more long-term solution that includes service providers.\n  * **This proposal, if passed, could bring the DAO an extra $5-15M per year of profit.**\n  * We also\u00a0[tapped](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-support-creation-of-an-arbitrum-dao-budget/23802)\u00a0on the ARDC to conduct research into these areas, thereby utilizing existing resources at the DAO\u2019s disposal rather than wasting additional resources.\n* [Moved quickly](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22498645709460639498013508413205734891453964526622655693207250687057651118730)\u00a0to get Hack Humanity, the entity behind GovHack, ample funding to throw an event in Brussels at ETH CC for the Arbitrum community. These events require a substantial amount of lead time to plan, and the event would not have been possible if a few extra weeks had passed prior to getting the event funded.\n  * This is a great example of Entropy Advisors helping 3rd party service providers navigate the DAO while also combatting the collective inactive problem mentioned above.

This has helped ensure no two entities are working on the same thing in silos and will become more important in the future as we define the DAO\u2019s long-term strategic vision.\n* By leveraging our existing network, we have kicked off discussions with potential major partners for the DAO. We will always be representing Arbitrum DAO in a high-value context, even though sometimes it won\u2019t be visible to the broader DAO until the end of the negotiations\u2019 lifecycle.\n\n# Specifications\n\nIf this proposal passes, Entropy Advisors will sign a 1-year exclusivity agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation. The partnership will begin on the first of the month after this proposal passes. During this time, Entropy will service no other clients in any capacity. We will achieve the aforementioned goals through the following deliverables:\n\n### Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)\n\n* Neutral Proposal Broker\n  * Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO. Facilitate introductions between delegates, contributors, DAO leaders, and key strategic partners.\n  * Assist with drafting and delivering proposals from select third parties to the DAO.\n* Proposal Incubation\n  * Facilitate the oversight and creation of neutral DAO frameworks and initiatives that do not benefit Entropy and only have the DAO\u2019s best interests in mind.\n  * The idea behind Entropy is to assemble a team composed of highly capable DAO contributors with differing perspectives and expertises\u2014we will use our collective brain power to create proposals that benefit Arbitrum over the long term and are aligned with community priorities.\n  * Enable the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.\n\n### Strategy and Ecosystem Alignment\n\n* Serve as the liaison between Arbitrum\u2019s key stakeholders\n  * Host meetings with key stakeholders and report needs and updates between the relevant parties. Report notes to DAO when able.\n  * Turn conversations and takeaways into an actionable plan and begin executing.\n* Product and Strategy\n  * Regularly discuss with application developers within the Arbitrum ecosystem, relay this information to development teams/the Foundation, and use the insights to create discussions with clear goals on the Arbitrum governance forum.\n  * Assist the key stakeholders on partnerships/integrations as needed. We will serve as an extra set of eyes to highlight emerging technologies and trends within crypto, aiding Arbitrum parties when we can be helpful.\n  * Generally speaking, ensure that the Arbitrum DAO is on track to becoming a sustainable entity with sensible spending and a focus on profit generation.\n\nData and Brand Building\n\n* Build up a high-value brand through various mediums, such as X/Twitter with educational content and research, YouTube/Apple/Spotify through a podcast, and email through weekly newsletters.\n  * Bring visibility into DAO initiatives and RFPs.\n  * Represent the DAO professionally and with a demeanor that the community can be proud of.\n* Aid DAO-funded organizations like the ARDC and OBL in conducting research and analytics to inform proposal development.\n  * Utilize data analytics to help the DAO with accountability and transparency around its initiatives.\n\n# Vision\n\nOur vision for working with the Arbitrum DAO is structured in three key phases, each building upon the success of the previous one to ensure a thriving partnership.\n\n### \\[Complete] Phase 1: Establishing The Foundation For Entropy<>Arbitrum\n\nIn the initial phase, our focus was on establishing a solid foundation by identifying and addressing key pain points within the DAO. This involved acting as a neutral party to broker proposals, aligning stakeholders, attracting talent, and improving strategic partner onboarding and stakeholder relations. Our initial efforts have already demonstrated notable progress in a short time period, setting the stage for a more capable DAO.\n\nDuring Phase 1 we identified how Entropy fits into the broader DAO, and how we can be most useful. This involved lessons learned in passing proposals, project management, and working with new and existing partners. Additionally, we took this time to start building relationships with all of the DAO\u2019s most active stakeholders including many delegates, members of the foundation, protocol teams, and key individuals at Offchain Labs.\n\n### \\[This Proposal] Phase 2: Passing a DAO Proposal For One Year of Continued Work.\n\nOver the next year, we will build on the foundations we have established, aiming to make the Arbitrum DAO an efficient and effective community dedicated to long-term sustainability through the points brought up in the Motivation & Rationale section.\n\nWe will enhance governance processes by ensuring the initiatives we develop and implement focus on accountability. By fostering stronger relationships between key stakeholders we will ensure more cohesive collaboration. Through data, quantitative, and qualitative analysis we will begin to analyze active initiatives and propose clawbacks and other mechanisms to decrease DAO spend to focus its budget on high ROI initiatives.\n\nLeveraging our extensive network, we will secure partnerships that bring value to the DAO, enhancing the overall ecosystem. Additionally, we will pick up small lift brand and marketing campaigns to help bring awareness to DAO initiatives. We will continue to attract and retain high-quality contributors by offering competitive compensation, professional development opportunities, and a collaborative work environment.\n\nThrough strategic projects, such as well-thought-out economic stimulation, we will support the DAO in generating sustainable revenue streams. Our proposal includes an agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation so that if the OpCo is stood up in the next year, we can easily port our agreement to fall under its purview instead of the Foundation.\n\n### Phase 3: A Well-Oiled Machine\n\nIn Phase 3, we envision Entropy Advisors as a well-oiled machine, seamlessly servicing the Arbitrum DAO. Entropy will grow together with the ecosystem, continuing to perfect the deliverables mentioned earlier while looking for areas where we can add value. By this stage, we will have employed and retained top talent, creating an environment where the DAO operates at peak efficiency. Our efforts will help position Arbitrum as the clear-cut leader in the rollup ecosystem, driving innovation, growth, and success.\n\nAt this point OpCo should be well underway and Entropy Advisors will continue to serve as a service provider to OpCo, if viewed as beneficial. The DAO will be able to retain a second year of Entropy\u2019s services under the same terms stipulated in this proposal, if it desires to do so. For this second-year engagement clause to be executed in the future, the DAO will also need to vote in favor of the future bonus proposal discussed below. If the OpCo is stood up, this entity can be responsible for the potential renewal in place of a DAO vote. This structure would come into effect at the end of our initial 1-year term.\n\n# Short Term Deliverables\n\nWe are committed to defining clear goals for the coming weeks and months, while also encouraging collaboration with other contributors. Our proposed initiatives include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. **Proposal for a DAO-led Events Strategy**\n2. **Facilitate Process to Get OpCo Up and Running**\n   a. Part 1: Ratifying DAO vision, mission, and goals\n   b. Part 2: Establishing oversight mechanisms\n   c. Part 3: Outlining a barebones scope for OpCo, including a budget for setup and initial roles\n3. **Proposal for Chain Economic Parameters Management**\n4. **Ready to Turn Failed Proposals into Frameworks**\n   a. If needed, transforming unsuccessful proposals into actionable frameworks (as needed, potentially treasury mgmt, incentives, etc for example)\n5. **Kickstarting Stylus Development Proposal(s)**\n6. **Proposals for Bringing Strategic Partners for the DAO (Stablecoin, Gaming, Native DEX, Dev Shop, for example)**\n7. **Author at least 1 research report that provide the DAO insight into problems we identify**\n8. **Delegate Code of Conduct Proposal**\n9. **Hiring a Data Analyst**\n\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where multiple parties can work and provide input together to achieve these objectives.\n\nIn order to address our promise to give the DAO the ability to directly and openly provide input into the work we are facilitating, we will be posting monthly Short Term Deliverables similar to the ones included above in an \u201cEntropy\u201d category in the forum. We will call for feedback on our workload and goals, and ask for suggestions as to how to either add new initiatives or remove existing ones from our workload. We will additionally host an Entropy office hour biweekly open to all.\n\n# Cost & Budget Breakdown\n\n**Salaries: $1.96M**\n\n* Justification: According to\u00a0[Delphi\u00a05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGkU4uF_Lz5Y_qiOaimLAVxYdy9JfEn3DfIraJCUY0E/edit), a VC analyst (the lowest level employee) makes $85,000-$160,000 + a carry with more senior positions making significantly more. Employees cost an employer substantially more than base salary due to benefits, taxes, and other assorted costs. This ensures competitive compensation to attract and retain top talent, with our goal being to hire up to 10 employees. Additionally, we will be able to hire independent contractors and service providers on a project-by-project basis as needed. We are doing highly specialized work, and obtaining experienced individuals in the middle of a bull market with extensive experience in operations, project management, finance, and governance that are also crypto native will be expensive.\n\n**Legal, Insurance, and Accounting: $90K**\n\n* Justification: Covers necessary legal, insurance, and accounting services to ensure compliance and protect the organization. As a company operating in a forward-facing role in the governance space, a sufficient budget is necessary to protect against changing tides in the regulatory environment. Costs include setting up a Cayman Entity, D\\&O + E\\&O insurance, accountant\u2019s hours, ESOP, employee agreement reviews, and more.\n\n**Conference Travel, Offsites, and Small Events: $105K**\n\n* Justification: It is important that Entropy represent Arbitrum DAO at industry leading events. Hosting our own small events is important for brand building. Offsites and conferences can cost as much as $5,000 per employee in attendance. Even throwing a small \u201cHappy Hour\u201d type event can cost between $5,000 and $15,000. This enables Entropy members to attend industry conferences, conduct 1-2 offsites per year, and host 1-2 small events to foster team collaboration and engagement with the community. All while representing Arbitrum DAO in a professional manner.\n\n**Assorted Software: $21K**\n\n* Justification: Enterprise Dune, Gusto, QuickBooks, Replit, Google Suite, Web Hosting, Laevitas, Token Terminal, Open AI API, Slack, etc. Provides essential tools and platforms for data analysis, development, operations, and communication.\n\n**Office / Misc: $70K**\n\n* Justification: Covers expenses for coworking spaces, office equipment (laptops, podcast materials, office stipend), dinner stipend for late nights, and other miscellaneous costs to support a productive work environment.\n\n**Operating Budget Subtotal: $2.246M**\n\n**Margin / Contingency (~10%): $224K**\n\n* Justification: Provides a buffer for unforeseen expenses and ensures the project\u2019s smooth progression and some potential profit for the company over year 1.\n\n### Total Budget: $2.47M\n\n## Payment Details and Clawback\n\nWhile the Entropy team scales, they will be eligible to claim a reduced $100,000 per month and after crossing the threshold of 7 employees dedicated to Arbitrum, will be eligible to claim regular monthly payments ($2,470,000/12 = $205,834) for the remainder of the 12 month term. Payments that have accrued can be claimed at any time.\n\nA total of 6 million ARB will be sent to the Foundation, for them to monetize at their discretion to secure at least $2,470,000. Any Excess ARB not monetized (or stored for the potential bonus below) and excess stables from lower payments during the initial scaling of Entropy will be sent back to the DAO by the Foundation.\n\n### Termination and Clawback\n\nThe DAO may vote via Snapshot to terminate Arbitrum\u2019s relationship with Entropy Advisors at any time. Quorum for this proposal will be set at the same level as ongoing non-constitutional onchain proposals, with quorum defined as total votes for termination+abstention, and the proposal must have more voting power in favor of termination than against or abstaining. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked for Entropy Advisors will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation.\n\n### ARB Bonus \u2013 Maximum of 1.5M ARB\n\nThe Foundation will hold 1.5 million ARB allocated to potential performance bonuses. As the 1-year period comes to a close, Entropy will post a Snapshot vote so that the DAO may decide if the bonus should be distributed. The DAO will have the options of no bonus, 10% bonus, 25% bonus, or a 40% bonus. The bonus will be denominated in the dollar equivalent of ARB in relation to the initial funding amount ($2.47M) requested in this proposal. For example, if the DAO is only slightly pleased with the amount of work we conduct and the 10% bonus is voted for, Entropy will receive $247K of ARB tokens \u2013 which will depend on the spot price of ARB at the time of the snapshot\u2019s passing. The amount of ARB distributed as a bonus cannot exceed the 1.5M ARB amount being escrowed by the Foundation. If the proposal passes, the Foundation will send the X (TBD number) ARB to a 3-year vesting smart contract that pays out to Entropy Advisors in monthly streams. This ensures Entropy Advisors remains aligned with the DAO and ARB token even after this agreement has expired and as we move into Phase 3 and onward.\n\n### Return\n\nThe Foundation will send all funds in excess of \u2013 $2,470,000 + 1.5 million ARB \u2013 back to the DAO. At the end of the year, any additional dollars resulting from months where Entropy receives $100,000 instead of the full allocation, and remainder from 1.5M ARB if the full bonus is not allocated, will also be returned.\n\n### Transparency Reporting\n\nAt the end of each fiscal quarter, we will publish a transparency report that goes over our activities and total spending. Information included will be what we have done, an analysis of impact, and the total cost associated with running the business.\n\n## Our vision is to turn Arbitrum into a sustainable entity with durable operations in place. Entropy will be the spearhead of catalyzing operational change and leave long-lasting structure in its wake."

    "description": "# [NON-CONSTITUTIONAL] Arbitrum Audit Program\n# Arbitrum Audit Program\n\nSummary:\n\n* The Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to run an on-going open application for 1 year to support projects that require a subsidy to audit their project.\n* A list of auditors will be approved into the program, and auditing firms are also invited from the ADPC\u2019s Security Subsidy Fund to apply for the program.\n* Arbitrum Audit Committee will include membership of Arbitrum Foundation, Offchain Labs, a technical expert elected by the DAO, and a team member from the OpCo (when operational).\n\n## Abstract\n\nIt is industry standard and recommended practice that all projects with on-chain smart contracts undergo at least one third party audit. This is because smart contracts can potentially secure millions, if not billions of dollars, yet a single bug in the code can result in the loss of all funds. In many cases, when the smart contract is deployed, it can be difficult to upgrade after launch, and audits should be completed prior to the project going live.\n\nUnfortunately, audits are prohibitively expensive. It is not uncommon for projects to pay ~$20k per auditor per week. If multiple auditors are required for the project, then the bill increases substantially into six figures. This is problematic for early stage projects who may simply lack the funds to pay for an audit or be forced to allocate a significant portion of the funds they have raised from investors to pay for the audit.\n\nThis proposal aims to implement a subsidy scheme that will allocate funds to projects that require financial assistance to pay for an audit. To be eligible for the funds, the project will need to satisfy certain requirements such as launching on Arbitrum and any code audited will need to remain exclusive to our ecosystem for a fixed period of time.\n\nWe are targeting relatively early stage projects, projects that have demonstrated product market fit on Arbitrum, and finally projects that have remained loyal to our ecosystem with an upcoming launch or upgrade that has the potential to help grow the ecosystem.\n\nThe subsidy program will run for 1 year or until all funds are spent. An appointed Arbitrum Audit committee will run the program. There will be 4 (quarterly) transparency reports alongside a final summary report to keep the DAO abreast about program updates.\n\n## Rationale and Goals\n\n1. **Support early-stage projects.**\u00a0Promising projects face funding constraints that may prevent their launch without access to a third party audit or for them to somewhat dangerously \u2018test in production.\u2019\n2. **Encourage development on Arbitrum.**\u00a0By supporting builders and early-stage projects, we can potentially help make Arbitrum their home over other blockchains.\n3. **Scaling Responsibly.**\u00a0Scalability is not just about transaction throughput, but the ability for the system as a whole to secure and protect an increasing number of tokens (TVL).\n4. **On-demand availability**. An open applications process to offer subsidy grants to projects just in time before their planned launch.\n\n## Application Process\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"79\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4dba90dfcb10fad5cb7debac34b9ec6f83e03ab5_2_624x79.png\" />1600\u00d7203 26.7 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4dba90dfcb10fad5cb7debac34b9ec6f83e03ab5.png)\n\n\n\nThe Arbitrum Audit Subsidy Program invites projects to apply via an open applications track with a standardised form to gather the following information:\n\n* **Team Information**\n  * Names\n  * Background\n  * Notable Investors\n* **Project Information**\n  * Overview & problem it is solving\n  * Why will project achieve product market fit (or evidence of PMF, like traction or other metrics)\n  * Stage of development & timeline to mainnet\n* **Audit coverage**\n  * Scope of audit\n  * Lines of code & languages\n  * Desired completion date\n  * \\[extra information here]\n* **Subsidy information**\n  * Preferred auditor \\[optional]\n  * Audit budget request\n\nThe committee will screen the above information based on:\n\n* **Technical maturity:**\u00a0Assess whether the code base is ready for a professional audit.\n* **Team experience:**\u00a0Evaluate whether the team has the experience, expertise, and motivation to successfully launch the project on mainnet.\n* **Likelihood of success:**\u00a0Judge whether the project has the potential to attract a user base and establish itself as a popular decentralized application on Arbitrum.\n* **Reasonable scope:**\u00a0Determine if the audit\u2019s scope can be completed within the proposed timeline and budget.\n* **Arbitrum first.**\u00a0The project will prioritise launching on Arbitrum including One, Nova, and other Arbitrum chains.\n\nA project can be rejected at any stage of the process at the committee\u2019s discretion.\n\nIf the committee approves the project during the screening process, then it will undertake due diligence which may include reference checks, reviewing the code related to the audit scope, and other information it may deem necessary to check. Assuming the due diligence succeeds, then the committee will aid the project in connecting with auditors to get the best quote alongside confirming the auditor has the capability to audit the project.\n\nIt is up to the project to decide on the auditor, but it must be in agreement with the Arbitrum Audit committee. We expect auditors to be selected based on the rate charged to the project (i.e., auditor per week cost), availability and timeline for completing the audit and experience with auditing similar projects. In the case of an auditing competition platform, the auditor will need to demonstrate that the auditors on their platform have the required skillset for the specific project.\n\nKeep in mind, this is a subsidy program, which will require the project to pay a portion of the audit, which will also be negotiated as part of the application process.\n\n## Eligibility Requirements\n\nWe welcome applications from early stage and existing projects that satisfy the following requirements:\n\n* **Smart contracts.**\u00a0Projects must have auditable smart contract code to qualify. We only subsidize audits for smart contracts and not the wider infrastructure. For example, Solidity or Stylus.\n* **Early stage project.**\u00a0Projects yet to launch their product are eligible or there is a significant upgrade for the code. They are allowed to have received venture capital or grants. Total funds raised will be considered as part of the decision making process by the committee.\n* **Native deployment.**\u00a0Projects that are operational on Arbitrum must demonstrate either a strong product market fit or a committed alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem with expectations that subsequent product launches will be successful.\n* **Migrating deployment.**\u00a0Project is planning to migrate from another blockchain ecosystem to Arbitrum\n* **New audits only.**\u00a0Only new code, or code that has undergone significant modifications.\n* **Arbitrum exclusivity.**\u00a0Audited code must remain exclusive to Arbitrum for a fixed period of time.\n* **Arbitrum ecosystem.**\u00a0The project must launch in the Arbitrum ecosystem which includes all Arbitrum chains (including Arbitrum One or launching their own chain).\n\nWith the above in mind, our aim is to target early stage projects with potential to grow on Arbitrum as well as projects with a strong track record or loyalty to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAll audited code MUST remain exclusive to the Arbitrum ecosystem and this will be included in the relevant legal agreements. Breaching exclusivity will obligate the project to repay the full subsidy to the DAO via the Arbitrum Foundation (AF). Non-compliance may lead to legal recourse and/or a proposal to the DAO to ban the project from all future DAO-funded initiatives.\n\n## Subsidy Payment Conditions\n\nSubsidy payments will only be paid after the audit is completed. The Arbitrum Foundation will disburse the funds to the auditor. All payments are contingent upon the Foundation\u2019s satisfaction that the audit meets acceptable quality and confirms to industry standards.\n\nAdditionally, we will seek when possible to offer the payment in ARB as opposed to USD, subject to the auditor\u2019s needs.\n\n## Approving Auditors\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will take on the role of evaluating auditors who want to apply for this program which includes an interview, reference checks, compliance, and agreement to the terms & conditions of this program. It should be noted that we will conduct an individual negotiation with all approved auditors to take into account potential different rates and offerings from the auditors. Additionally, auditors can apply at any time to join the program.\n\nAn approved auditor will have an opportunity to post on the forum to advertise that they have been accepted to the program. This will assist projects with finding auditors that may be suitable for them even if a subsidy is not offered by this program.\n\nAdditionally, we will invite auditing firms from the ADPC\u2019s Security Subsidy Fund to apply, with the intention for us to negotiate additional terms that are suitable for this new program.\n\n## Arbitrum Audit Committee\n\nWe propose a committee with a mixture of technical expertise and DAO representation who will have the necessary skills and time to review proposals on an on-going basis.\n\n1. Chair: Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n2. Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n3. Technical Expert - Elected by DAO\n4. Arbitrum DAO\u2019s OpCo (when operational)\n\nWe have included the OpCo as a potential team member as soon as it is operational and considers itself ready to join. The AF will chair the committee to lead the discussion and decision making process with consultation of other committee members.\n\nThe committee will enforce a strict conflict of interest policy such that no member should have any financial ties to an approved auditing firm that is taking part in the program and they should not have a significant conflict of interest with competing blockchain projects. The technical expert should not be part of the auditing firms engaged in the program and will be paid USD$5k per month. We expect the workload to be ~1-2 days per week.\n\nScope of work includes:\n\n* Attend committee meetings to evaluate proposals,\n* Support some due diligence efforts on projects,\n* Lend expertise to make good decisions,\n* Help with transparency & reporting.\n\n## Transparency Report\n\nThe committee will publish an update in regards to the program every 3 months with a total of 4 reports. Additionally, a final \u2018conclusion report\u2019 will be published, after the final audit subsidy is paid.\n\nAll reports will include the following information:\n\n* Categories of projects in the pipeline (DeFi, Gaming, SocialFi, etc),\n* Total projects rejected, under review and accepted,\n* Completed audits alongside disclosure on project and selected auditor,\n* Treasury of ARB and USD alongside funds spent to date,\n* Success stories.\n\nAs mentioned during the governance calls, we do not plan to release specific financial details related to individual subsidy payment. The ADPC acknowledged that auditors are sensitive to revealing their rates to competitors. Additionally, this information is often leveraged by potential grantees during the negotiation process which would make the committee\u2019s job more difficult.\n\nWe may also have a delay in reporting the \u2018funds spent to date\u2019 depending on the total grants issued to help preserve some privacy around individual subsidies paid. We hope to include success stories, but this will be in later reports as it will take time for audits to be completed, protocols to launch, and for success stories to emerge.\n\nAdditionally, all grantees of the program will be requested to publish a growth report to the DAO, 2, 4 and 6 months after their project is launched on Arbitrum. In this report, we expect the grantee to publish metrics relevant to their project, including but not limited to, total value locked (TVL), protocol fees generated, integration with other protocols in Arbitrum, utilization of assets, etc. The committee will work with the grantee to determine the relevant metrics and deadlines for publishing the report. The Arbitrum Foundation will keep track of the reports after the program has finished to ensure they are all published to the DAO.\n\n## Budget Request\n\nIt is not uncommon for projects to pay $10k to $40k per auditor per week depending on the complexity of the project with overall costs exceeding $100k.\n\nIf we assume, conservatively, that each project will receive a $100k subsidy, then with a $10M budget, we can subsidize around 100 projects to build on Arbitrum which is approximately 1.9 projects per week for 1 year.\n\nWe are requesting a $10M USD budget to subsidise audits for 1 year and $60K to pay for the technical expert. All other costs including legal, management of the program, etc, will be covered by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nOur proposal will:\n\n* Request 30m ARB from the treasury,\n* Convert ARB into $10m and $60k (compensation),\n* Return all unused ARB and USDC back to the DAO.\n\nWhenever the program ends, the remaining funds in USDC and ARB, will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO unless the DAO approves the continuation of the program via an off-chain vote.\n\nWe intend to convert ARB to USD periodically throughout the duration of the auditing program as opposed to exchanging it all at once.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe consider the establishment of a long-term security subsidy fund as an urgent matter to support builders in Arbitrum and will work with contributors in the Arbitrum DAO to get the program set up as soon as possible.\n\nWe have run three governance calls with two recorded \\[[1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qY81BLCjMTNeXvOrtAt2dxDyoKCFCuFq/view),[2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nnBbdk02VTDLFfDy-MMzmgm3rGx6fzrP/view)] and the temperature check vote has\u00a0[passed on Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xebbcad364ae7f02797b9cd7f30c668907d479d4bb5ba7f5d775849822297a01d).\n\nWe are appreciative of all the helpful comments and discussions we have had with contributors in the DAO. We believe the proposal should hopefully satisfy most comments that have been raised over the past few weeks and the proposal is overall better thanks to the process.\n\nAssuming the proposal is approved by the Arbitrum DAO, then we will:\n\n* Hold an election to hire the technical expert that should be concluded by 10th April 2025.\n* Onboard auditors and open applications for projects by late April 2025.\n\nAn official announcement will be published to declare the start date and when the 1 year clock for the program begins."

It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale**\u00a0- the ARDC\u2019s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\u00a0- Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023.

The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot\u00a07](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC\u2019s mandate will naturally aid in \u2018Governance Optimization\u2019 through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC\u2019s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition\u2019s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO\u2019s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC\u2019s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe\u00a0***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC\u2019s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate\u2019s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem\u2019s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024\u00d7768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF:\u00a0[The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs\u00a03](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member\u2019s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC\u2019s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC\u2019S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it\u2019s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC\u2019s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC\u2019s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.\n* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.\n\n**The Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ARDC Multi-Sig via the Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability]:**\u00a0[**Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability\\]**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)\n\n**In addition, after the ARDC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ARDC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO\u2019s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.**\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC\u2019s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums."

This brings the potential total term to one (1) year.\n* Funding Structure Revision: A restructuring of the funding approach to better align with the updated objectives and framework.\n* Supervisory Council Composition: The Supervisory Council will have responsibilities at both macro and micro levels, ensuring comprehensive oversight, strategic alignment, and effective day-to-day operations. At the micro level, two (2) of the elected members will focus on communications and one (1) will focus on operations.\n* Supervisory Council Elections: Candidates will specify their preferred roles in the application form, but a single general election snapshot will still be conducted as initially proposed. If multiple top-ranking candidates choose the same role, the highest-ranking ones are selected for that role, while others are redirected to fill alternative roles based on their preferences.\n* Retainer Model: The payment structure for working members has been refined to better align incentives and reduce the risk of underutilisation in ARDC V2. Now, 4/5 of the cap allocated for the initial 6-month term per vertical is contingent upon actual project needs, ensuring that these payments are directly tied to usage.\n\n**The Snapshot proposal for ARDC V2 was successfully passed on 24-Oct-2024 (https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc9fc6b61c7e13a4645937937600397e496a3f4703a8f4d00e11c0f641d86ce9f) with the DAO voting for '1.73M + Council Budget'.**\n\n***Non-Constitutional***\n\nDefining \u2018Arbitrum Research & Development Collective\u2019 or \u2018ARDC\u2019: *An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO in relation to research & development initiatives*\n\n\u00a0TL;DR\n\n* This proposal seeks to extend and build upon the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[V1], which ended up publishing 42 deliverables in the forum relating to the three verticals (Research \u2013 Security \u2013 Risk).\n* ARDC V1 returned over 1.0 million ARB to the DAO\u2019s Treasury demonstrating how the ARDC can deliver tangible value. As ARDC V2 moves forward, this underscores the potential for further benefits that, although not always predictable, can significantly enhance the DAO\u2019s financial position.\n* The ARDC V2 is being proposed for an initial 6-month term, with the possibility of a 6-month extension pending a future Snapshot vote.\n* Establishes a more structured and well-managed framework through the introduction of the Supervisory Council. At the micro level, the Council will consist of three elected members, with two focused on communications and one dedicated to operations.\n* The ARDC\u2019s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its cohort of industry-leading research providers.\n* Utilisation of a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Aera to convert the program\u2019s ARB into USDC for operational purposes.\n* The introduction of a Retainer Model to better align incentives between the Working Members and the DAO, mitigating the risk of underutilization by tying four-fifths of the applicable cap for the initial six-month term to usage as required.\n* The Snapshot proposal for ARDC V2 was successfully passed on 24-Oct-2024 and can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc9fc6b61c7e13a4645937937600397e496a3f4703a8f4d00e11c0f641d86ce9f).\n\n\u00a0**ARDC v1 Overview**\n\nIn the first iteration of the ARDC, we experimented with the structure and the remuneration framework. In this regard, we adopted a DAOAdvocate role as inspired by the Arbitrum Coalition (Refer: [Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)).

Although the ARDC term has concluded, the engagement of the members will be officially regarded as \u2018concluded\u2019 upon publishing the final deliverables.*\n\nAs outlined in the [Final Outcome Report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-final-report/27050) prepared by the DAO Advocate, L2Beat, member performance should not be assessed solely by the number of deliverables completed. Each deliverable varies in complexity, making a simple tally an inadequate measure of contribution. For this reason, individual totals for each member were not compiled, as it would not provide an accurate comparison.\n\nSince the ARDC launched in April, several in-depth studies have been undertaken. A particular focus was attributed to the STIP program in individual protocols like GMX, JOJO, Vertex, Silo Finance and Pendle Finance. This included retroactive analyses on the impact of the STIP on trading volumes in perp DEX protocols, spot DEX and yield aggregator TVL, and sequencer revenue. These analyses provided valuable insights into the broader market impacts of the STIP incentives and their effectiveness in driving desired outcomes, resulting in an averageof 1,000,000 ARB being returned to the DAOs treasury.\n\nSignificant concerns regarding Synapse\u2019s handling of ARB incentives, leading to the withdrawal of Synapse\u2019s application from the STIP Bridge. This incident highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring and transparency in the allocation and usage of incentives. Moreover, risk assessments were conducted across multiple initiatives, accompanied by several security evaluations. These included the BOLD proposal, Security Council improvements, Event Horizon contracts as well as an analysis of the Gaming Catalyst Program.\n\nThis highlights the importance of post-rollout research as a critical tool for continuous improvement, allowing the DAO to learn from past experiences and refine its strategies. By systematically analysing outcomes and identifying areas for enhancement, the DAO can build on successes, address challenges, and make increasingly informed decisions.\n\n\u00a0**Summary**\n\nThis proposal builds upon the foundation established by the Arbitrum Research and Development Collective \\[V1], introducing a more efficient and structured framework. In ARDC \\[V2], proposed working members are required to specify their hourly rate in a separate application form, with the payment structure being refined to follow that of a retainer model. This will help to better align incentives given that four-fifths of the cap allocated per vertical for the initial six-month term is contingent upon actual project needs, ensuring that these payments are directly tied to usage.\n\nWe are also pleased to announce that the Arbitrum Foundation will be undertaking an \u2018Observer\u2019 role in relation to the Supervisory Council to aid in streamlining ARDC efforts, communication and overall efficacy.\n\nAdditionally, applicants must outline a scope of work for the ArbitrumDAO covering one-third of their total workload for the initial 6-month term, complete with clear deliverables and timelines. The remainder of their workload will serve as a flexible budget to address tasks on an \u201cas-needed\u201d basis, allowing providers to demonstrate their understanding of the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s most pressing needs.\n\nThe final decision on the work carried out by elected working members will ultimately rest with the Supervisory Council. While the proposed scope serves as an initial framework, the Council will oversee and adjust the workload on a case-by-case basis, prioritising deliverables within each vertical and addressing any conflicts between pre-determined tasks and requests made by the ArbitrumDAO. Therefore, this proposed scope of work will not automatically apply after the election. This emphasises the Council\u2019s crucial role in maximising the effectiveness of ARDC v2, aligning tasks with the DAO\u2019s priorities, and ensuring smooth daily operations.\n\nThe goal is for this structure to gradually incorporate an Optimistic Governance Module (OGM), giving the community the power to veto ARDC deliverables. Unlike traditional token-based governance, which requires a majority of affirmative votes for proposals to pass, Optimistic Governance enables proposals to pass automatically unless they meet a predefined threshold of objection votes. This approach minimises bureaucratic overhead, facilitating more efficient decision-making for non-contentious proposals and fostering a more agile governance framework.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that ARDC v2 does not depend on the OGM for implementation; however, once Tally deploys the OGM for the DAO, a proposal will be submitted to integrate it into the ARDC structure.\n\n\u00a0**Supervisory Council**\n\n**SUPERVISORY COUNCIL ROLE IN THE ARDC: DETAILED RESPONSIBILITIES AND IMPORTANCE**\n\nThe DAOAdvocate\u2019s role was intended as a single designated entity responsible for guiding the ARDC\u2019s efforts and acting as a mediator between the DAO and the ARDC. This is fundamentally about representing the DAO\u2019s best interests, rather than the operational management of the coalition\u2019s activities.\n\nThese operational tasks, carried out by L2Beat included the establishing of communication channels and coordination among members, creating and maintaining a Notion page to document meeting minutes and track tasks through a kanban board, compliance and onboarding processes like KYC/KYB as well as regular updates and the maintenance of open communication channels among several others.\n\nIn the revised structure of the ARDC, we propose establishing the Supervisory Council, a body elected by the DAO to ensure alignment with its strategic and operational priorities. The Supervisory Council will be better positioned to capture the full range of perspectives and needs of the DAO community, bringing a variety of skills and viewpoints to strategic discussions.\n\nAt the same time, this Council will also be responsible for day-to-day management and coordination. This dual focus ensures that the ARDC\u2019s activities are strategically sound while being operationally effective, closing the gap between high-level guidance and the actual execution of tasks.\n\nThis structure will consist of three (3) individuals elected by the DAO for an initial six-month term, with the option to extend for an additional six months. Each member will receive a monthly compensation of 5,000 ARB throughout their tenure. As a result, the total compensation for the council over the initial six-month period will be 90,000 ARB, and, if extended, the total cost for a full year will amount to 180,000 ARB.\n\nAt a current price of $0.52/ARB, the initial 6-month term would cost approximately $46,800. For context, the DAOAdvocate role for ARDC v1 was compensated with 50,000 ARB, which, at the current price of $1.70 would have equated to $85,000. This comparison underscores the cost-effectiveness of the ARDC v2.\n\nThe Supervisory Council will operate at both macro and micro levels, ensuring comprehensive oversight, strategic alignment, and effective day-to-day operations. At the micro level, two (2) of the elected members will focus on communications and one (1) will focus on operations.\n\nBy clearly defining these roles and their corresponding responsibilities, the Council is better positioned to attract the right talent to enhance ARDC visibility and improve communication with OffChain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation. This approach aims to bridge the gap between the ARDC, the DAO, the Arbitrum Foundation, and OffChain Labs.\n\n**\\[A] MACRO-LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\n**Strategic Oversight & Resource Management:**\n\n1. Define overall strategic priorities for ARDC initiatives, conducting regular evaluations to ensure alignment with the DAO\u2019s objectives. Intervene as necessary to realign projects with these priorities.\n2. Set guidelines for financial, human, and technical resource allocations, establishing frameworks that prioritise high-impact projects while allowing the micro-level team to handle daily resource distribution.\n3. Provide high-level budget oversight, ensuring resources are allocated according to strategic guidelines while empowering operations to manage day-to-day budget adherence.\n\n**Representation of DAO Interests & Coordination:**\n\n1. Serve as a central point of contact between ARDC members, the ArbitrumDAO, and external partners, ensuring the DAO\u2019s strategic interests are reflected in ARDC decision-making.\n2. Organise periodic community consultations on major initiatives, delegating routine community engagement to the communications team. Ensure strategic topics and updates are shared with key stakeholders, including the Arbitrum community, OffChain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n**Conflict Resolution & Mediation:**\n\n1. Mediate conflicts that have strategic implications for the ARDC or that arise between the ARDC and the DAO, ensuring resolutions uphold the DAO\u2019s objectives.\n2. Provide a neutral platform for resolving disputes that may impact the ARDC\u2019s alignment with DAO goals.\n\n**\\[B] MICRO-LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\n**Communication Roles: Stakeholder Communication & Engagement:**\n\n1. Translate ARDC updates and research findings into accessible language for the Arbitrum community, emphasising the significance of research and milestones.\n2. Lead routine engagement and knowledge transfer between the ARDC, OffChain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation, ensuring stakeholders are well-informed on ARDC developments.\n3. Host bi-weekly community calls to keep the community informed and involved.\n\n**Communication Roles: Communication Strategy & Publication::**\n\n1. Develop and implement a communications strategy that aligns with ARDC goals and enhances visibility across the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n2. Create branding and messaging guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency in ARDC\u2019s public presence.\n3. Manage press releases, media relations, and social media to increase ARDC\u2019s visibility and support strategic messaging.\n\n**Operations Role: Internal Organisation & Financial Management::**\n\n1. Maintain accurate meeting minutes, publishing them on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO.\n2. Oversee a public dashboard for ARDC members to submit task updates, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n3. Solicit quotes from service providers for deliverables approved at the macro level.\n4. Track the completion of the initial one-fifth of hours for each project, which would have been pre-paid at the start, to ensure timely monitoring of progress and facilitate smooth transitions to subsequent payment phases as required.\n5. Coordinate payments with MSS and service providers, facilitating 50% pre-delivery and 50% post-delivery payments for the remaining hours for each project.\n6. Collaborate with service providers to submit invoices to the Arbitrum Foundation, ensuring payment aligns with approved deliverables.\n\n**Operations Role: Additional Operational Parameters::**\n\n1. Produce monthly reports detailing ARDC performance, including proposal updates, deliverables, and feedback from the Council.\n2. At the end of each 6-month term, prepare a comprehensive final outcome report summarising deliverables, priorities, and lessons learned, with feedback from working members on successes, challenges and key lessons learned.\n\nAdditionally, if a simple majority (2/3) of the Supervisory Council deem a member of the ARDC to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the Supervisory Council will be obliged to submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination.\n\nFollowing this, the Supervisory Council will have an ancillary obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post (for intra-ARDC elections, the same RFP-Based + Application election model will be utilised).\n\n\u00a0**Risk, Security, Research**\n\n***The Risk Member \\[Strictly Research & Analysis]***\n\nThe ideal Risk Member should possess strong quantitative skills to evaluate and manage risks across DeFi protocols, with sufficient expertise in modelling, simulations, and economic risk analysis. On an as-requested basis, they will assess protocol design, tokenomics, and governance mechanisms to ensure economic efficiency, incentivize usage, and safeguard systemic health. The role involves conducting thorough risk-focused research and applying modelling techniques to identify and mitigate potential threats. Additionally, the Risk Member will provide strategic guidance and data-driven insights to optimise risk management practices, supporting continuous monitoring, reporting, and informed decision-making to promote trust and sustainability in within the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n***The Security Member \\[Strictly Research & Analysis]***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualising the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews.\n\n***The Research Member \\[Strictly Research & Analysis]***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem\u2019s growth.\n\nMoreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**RETAINER MODEL**\n\nIn the application form, working members must specify their hourly rate, incentivizing them to propose competitive rates to enhance their chances of selection. The maximum allowable hours for each term will be calculated by dividing the total applicable cap by the hourly rate, which will assist the Supervisory Council in budgeting and establishing a benchmark for future budget planning.\n\nAligned with the principle that \u201c*incentives dictate outcomes*,\u201d the Supervisory Council will oversee task approval, whether from proposed scopes of work by the working members or from incoming requests. The Council will evaluate each potential deliverable\u2019s cost-effectiveness based on the elected members\u2019 estimated time commitment and hourly rate. This process motivates working members to provide accurate time estimates, as overestimating could reduce their chances of being assigned the deliverable.\n\nTo provide greater financial security for working members, one-fifth of the applicable cap relating to the initial six-month term will be paid upfront upon election. For example, if a working member\u2019s rate is $100 per hour and the DAO-approved retainer cap is $1,000, they would have a maximum of 10 hours available. In this scenario, the member would receive an upfront payment of one-fifth of the cap ($200), covering the first 2 hours of work.\n\nThe remaining portion of the cap will be contingent on actual work performed. This approach mitigates the risk of underutilisation by tying the remaining four-fifths of the applicable cap ($800) to usage as required. Once the Supervisory Council identifies a deliverable, the Operations member will issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to the relevant working member, outlining the anticipated hours needed. Following delegate feedback, the amount to be paid upfront was updated from one-third to one-fifth of the applicable cap for the initial six-month term.\n\nThis model ensures that:\n\n* Work allocation is optimised, avoiding the pitfall of completing suboptimal tasks solely to justify a prepaid expense, a challenge faced in ARDC V1 where DAO leverage was reduced.\n* Working members remain incentivised to perform efficiently, as the remainder of their payment is linked directly to hours allocated by the Supervisory Council.\n\nFollowing the completion of the initial one-fifth allocation, payment for subsequent work will be structured as follows: members will receive 50% of the quoted hours\u2019 payment before commencing each deliverable, with the remaining amount paid upon satisfactory completion. This phased payment structure promotes accountability and reinforces efficient, quality work.\n\n**ELECTION PROCESS**\n\nThe ARDC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the passing of the Snapshot proposal. A high-level overview of this process can be found in the diagram below.\n\n<img height=\"451\" width=\"602\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfjkAH_6j_OXj_gQnGLGzuRTmLQUBZxxMZTqU29g1hQFFxClSjMEpGper7r_CmT1xwI4iR19yS_El0nrNm4N7BqswdkWYMC7Qu36Q21Z90ypFB2BXJmACKJQNIT5ah1OliakKWJ26OSP3e__6YO95vyv1E?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\nAll ARDC members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ARDC \\[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions].\n\nThere will be four separate elections held:\n\n1.

Candidates will be required to specify their desired role in their application. For instance, if the top three elected candidates all apply for the Communication role, only the top two will be selected for that role. The third position will then be filled by the highest-ranking candidate who applied for the Operations role, ensuring a balanced allocation of roles within the Council.\n\nThe following timeline governs an election process that starts at time T \\[\u2018T\u2019 means the date that the Snapshot vote passes +3 days]:\n\n**GOVERNING RULES**\n\nWhile a joint application for each seat is permissible, an applicant may not apply as part of a joint application with other applicants & then proceed to apply as a Supervisory Council member or for another seat.\n\nThe fees (hourly rate/s) in the respective elected member\u2019s forum post application will apply once elected via Snapshot as per the Election Process.\u00a0\n\n**ELECTION STRUCTURE**\n\n*1.

Here, it is also the role of the Supervisory Council, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING:**\n\nComprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. The Supervisory Council will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC\u2019s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the Supervisory Council. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**DUTY OF IMPARTIALITY:**\n\nARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**OBLIGATION OF RECUSAL:**\n\nARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**PROHIBITION OF SELF-DEALING:**\n\nParticipants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organisations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship.\n\n**ETHICAL TRADING:**\n\nMembers are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n\u00a0**TERM**\n\nThe ARDC\u2019s mandate will be structured in two phases:\n\n* Phase 1: Upon the passing of this proposal, the first tranche of funding for 182 days (6 months) will be unlocked. The ARDC\u2019s mandate will commence 30 days (not business days) after the on-chain proposal is approved and executed. This provides sufficient time for the elected members and personnel to complete KYC/KYB with the Arbitrum Foundation and finalise the grant agreement.\n* Phase 2 - Extending Decision: At the end of the initial 6-month term, a Snapshot vote will be held, offering the ArbitrumDAO the following options:\n  * Extend the ARDC with the same working members.\n  * Extend the ARDC with a re-election of the working members.\n  * Do not extend the ARDC\n\nIf the DAO chooses not to extend the ARDC after the initial term, MSS will return the remaining USDC + ARB to the Treasury. There will be no subsequent OTC to buy back ARB with the USDC.\n\nThe ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the Supervisory Council following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the necessary communication channels.\n\n**FUNDING (ARDC V1)**\n\nIn the ARDC v1, the ARDC was funded with 1.76M ARB, which at a price of $1.7/ARB amounted to approximately $3.01M USD, inclusive of a bugger of around 30%. For the elected members at the time of the proposal, this would have amounted to:\n\n* Research \u2013 $1.13M USD \\[Quoted fees by Blockworks Research & Delphi Digital - $960,000]\n* Security \u2013 $1.13M USD \\[Quoted fees by OpenZeppelin - $$750,000]\n* Risk \u2013 $0.57M \\[Quoted fees by Chaos Labs - $320,000]\n* DAO Advocate \u2013 $85,000\n\nWhile the Final Outcome Report notes that the \u2018ROI\u2019 of ARDC V1 can\u2019t be objectively quantified, the return of over 1.0 million ARB to the DAO\u2019s Treasury demonstrates how ARDC can deliver tangible value. As ARDC V2 moves forward, this achievement underscores the potential for further benefits that, although not always predictable, can significantly enhance the DAO\u2019s financial position and overall impact.\n\nDue to the decrease in ARB\u2019s price, the total cost of ARDC V1 amounted to approximately $1.0M USD, which we\u2019ve designated as the baseline for Option B below. The amounts for Option A and Option C are estimated to be around 20% higher and lower, respectively.\n\nIn ARDC v1 funds were held in a 3/5 multi sig, however, for the ARDC v2, the multi-sig requested to manage the funds is within the [Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836) established by Entropy Advisors. This adjustment will save the ARDC V2 30,000 ARB by reducing the need for five multi-signature signers.\n\n**FUNDING (ARDC V2)**\n\n**ARB Token Calculation**\n\nTo determine the ARB token amount, we used the 14-day Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of ARB/USD, each as listed EOD UTC, until EOD on 27-Oct-2024 on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum/historical_data), prior to the proposal being posted on Tally. This method ensures a fair and current valuation while mitigating short-term price volatility.\n\nA 20% buffer has been added to account for potential price fluctuations between proposal submission and execution, so in the case of ARB depreciation, the ARDC multi-sig under the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) is still able to satisfy payments. The remaining unused funds of this buffer will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. The Multi-Sig wallet established by the MSS can be found at the following address: arb1:0x8deBa81C874C68C27a09706CdEa50d4F727E0711\n\nThe total budget requested from the on-chain vote is ARB 3,982,602, calculated based on the time-weighted ARB price of $0.5574/ARB. Please find the Google sheet with the corresponding calculation of the TWAP ARB amount [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19RlU-6FeM8dTPu4ct2GIeuvooG9SlMbt9v0dGSwSwV0/edit?gid=0#gid=0). Upon receiving the ARB, we will convert 1.73M USDC worth of ARB. Payment distributions solely for the Supervisory Council will be initiated through Llama Pay with payments for elected Risk, Security & Research members effected by the MSS.\n\n35,000 ARB to [@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer) as retroactive payment for the drafting, review and refinement of this proposal, as well as the managing of the election process itself and ensuring execution of all steps pre-commencement of the term. The 35,000 ARB will be delegated to the Immutablelawyer Tally profile for a minimum period of 90 days following receipt of funds. This increase is reflective of additional reviews, amendments, and hours allocated for refinement by our team.\n\nIn response to feedback received, allocations associated with risk have been increased by 20%. Additionally, the figures provided below are based on a full 1-year term. Should a decision be made not to extend ARDC v2, the funded amount would be capped at a maximum of half the amounts shown.\n\n**FUND CONVERSION (AERA)**\n\n### **Arb Conversion Strategy**\n\nThe ARDC will utilise a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Aera to convert the program\u2019s ARB into USDC for operational purposes, reducing counterparty price risk on OTC desks. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilises off-chain logic to monitor on chain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ARDC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modelling and executed on Odos, or Bebop.\n\n<img height=\"224\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeCD-x_-Um9_MqT7ZQOi9Gff6tLxit0QGgzVpA6oTXH-ROsqX-bJcKtd5R8QeOujvz2syx917p0_e4EOhcUVRi_bdVEVZvm-zmAiBoDwr2efh2vpKCw5hfdpGIdwCry8Xf3Q-vbVParjr5llEnicJzGxJ_r?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\n**Protocol-Owned Execution**\n\nThe Protocol-Owned Execution strategy uses off-chain logic to monitor on chain liquidity, model price impact, and plan the execution of active and passive trading.\n\nFor ARB on the Arbitrum Chain, Gauntlet will swap out tokens using either Odos (DEX aggregator) or BeBop (self-execution solver).\n\nPassive execution uses concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC pool (Odos supports projects such as Camelot, Uniswap V3, and [more](https://www.odos.xyz/about)). The amount converted through this position is periodically claimed, and a new ARB position is set in the pool. These can be thought of as limit orders.\n\n<img height=\"136\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdN_Zi6DkeqG4WfrxC4uhc7puzN10IdS0On3gmB32Pf0CNPHVWxXpxAJwvSUUPm3_RGjv_iqzcRyeYLJPCIteqiQSS6Cg8F6T00gqTxMiDkxYV94m7q0gNPSDxcU7rUdGIZzKL-M-FFgfzgXfys4vHqPw0?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\nActive and passive execution are used in tandem to maximise liquidity sourcing. Price impact modelling and gas cost determine the intraday trading schedule and size. Historical data is used to determine initial parameters. We continuously monitor slippage, intraday price impact, and medium-term price impact and adjust execution parameters if necessary.\n\nIntraday price impact is measured as the likelihood of observable price divergence in the hour after trading. The medium-term impact is measured as the effect of trade size on the divergence relative to a peer benchmark.\n\n<img height=\"444\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdE6s4YD8H8jBWuvhB2gii7vI8c6W4rEQZN-ymru4xfl9JV8SiUC5fvk33D5oB1W2YGHO389eEGOplDcRYc2Dqsq1-GkBn0ntTejQ7w-qJyr3wGDVCTsmLKFDikipKd7SSMXgrZXm0aZG6DuA3qB4QSUqc?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\nThe example chart shows rolling slippage for one of Aera\u2019s Trade Execution Customers.\n\n<img height=\"419\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXexNJBI-v6DX9a_yoNTX9hPc_1WTNAeoZsO9UWCu_ZsqiCpmDz0fq3kva4Xn6v7FJ26JEtDdaNxKW_CARa6q0I5EuVI-dzlSxhxpN3KFK84mLBtqcBUSGCY5On9for2sXbd9WZmjwNMVEIpUj51ErpGHT5E?key=_-yAgIWAu4UceVKYAopNgqKJ\" />\n\nThe example chart shows the likelihood of intraday impact for one of Aera\u2019s Trade Execution Customers.\n\nARDC Vault Parameters\n\n* Chain: Arbitrum\n* Vault Owner: MSS (arb1:0x8deBa81C874C68C27a09706CdEa50d4F727E0711)\n* Guardian: Gauntlet\n* Tokens: ARB, USDC\n* Protocols: Odos, Bebop\n* Strategy: Swap ARB for USDC; minimising market impact\n* Fee: 0%\n\n### **About Aera**\n\nAera is an on-chain solution to optimise DAO funds autonomously. It addresses the common pain point of inactive treasury management, which often hinders a DAO\u2019s ability to maintain its runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from market growth. Unlike traditional institutions that rely on agile managers for fund allocation, DAOs face unique challenges, including governance and incentive alignment with external managers.\n\nTo address these, Aera offers a unified solution for efficiently and transparently managing on-chain treasuries, grants, and incentive funds through customizable vaults. Aera vaults can hold stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies, with their objective functions tailored to each DAO\u2019s needs. Guardians leverage off-chain logic to automate rebalancing decisions, ensuring the vaults meet their objectives across various market scenarios and time horizons.\n\nYou can read more about Aera [here](https://docs.aera.finance/)."

As a preliminary document, it seeks input from both the Arbitrum DAO and the Liquidity Working Group.\n* This proposal frequently cites AIP-9.\n* For all of our resources see here: svy.gg/stip-backfund\u00a0\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a one-time backfund to all \"approved but not funded proposals\u2019\u2019 from Arbitrum STIP. The proposed AIP increases the total budget by 21.4M to 71.4M while increasing the total participating protocols by 26, for a total of 56 funded projects. The program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while leveraging distribution systems, consensus, and delegate diligence already created from STIP 1.\n\nThis program is designed to backfund approved protocols while maintaining the timelines and systems of STIP 1:\n\n* Timeline: The program is scheduled to commence and conclude concurrently with STIP 1, or within a similar timeframe, starting from the first week of November and running through January 31, 2024.\n* KYC: The program will utilize the same KYC system as STIP 1.\n* Reporting: Participating grantees are required to self-report data, maintain dashboards, and regularly summarize grant performance\n\n# Considerations\n\nBefore this proposal was drafted, a working group was formed to gauge sentiment, gather key data points, and outline the proposal\u2019s structure. The working group collaborated with delegates and projects affected by the STIP, engaging in multiple calls\u2014including sessions with the creators of the STIP and the Incentive Working Group\u2014to solicit feedback and refine the proposal accordingly.\n\nKey concerns discussed include:\n\n### Why not just push towards a round 2 and go through voting for all proposals again?\n\nFirst and foremost, we believe that the successful execution of this Backfund proposal will, in time, serve as a crucial catalyst for future grant structures, including a successful STIP round 2. Why? This opportunity will unify the Arbitrum ecosystem by addressing key weaknesses in the original STIP 1 structure by quickly providing approved projects and other stakeholders with the resources/data needed to design and support future programs.\n\nKey issues associated with delaying an immediate backfund and moving towards a round 2 include:\n\n* Proper design and execution add considerable time delay to a highly competitive environment within Arbitrum and other L2s\n* Requires teams with limited resources approved already for STIP 1 to spend significant time lobbying delegates\n* Removes attention away from new Round 2 proposals\n* Adds additional burden to delegates that should be focused on long-term design improvements and new STIP grants not yet approved\n* Removes key data for STIP experiment analysis by skewing learnings towards larger, well-established projects\n* Delays the alignment of the STIP with the Arbitrum constitution values of inclusivity and diversity\n* Negatively impacts new builder sentiment towards Arbitrum at a critical time in the L2 Wars\n\n### The budget set aside was 50M, and the DAO decided that was the acceptable spend for a short-term incentive.\n\nWhile the budget was set at 50M, the original working group proposed 75M so that:\n\n> \u201cThe budget was raised to 75M ARB to accommodate larger protocols (Pinnacle Grants) without compromising smaller applications.\u201d\u00a0[tnorm, September 3rd 2023.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131/12)\n\nExcess demand was a significant possibility due to the high interest in STIP and the absence of a cap for Pinnacle grants. Voters lacked the data to ascertain whether the initial 50M would be adequate to achieve the objectives of STIP.\n\nNoteworthy is that, in the event of excess demand, measures including backfunding were already outlined as potential options.\n\nProper design and fulfillment of a Round 2 or similar future funding programs may take time to develop. Meanwhile, projects that received approval but no funding have immediate initiatives requiring support. Our opportunity is to fund these initiatives, level the competitive playing field, and enhance the data available for the STIP process.\n\n[<img height=\"285\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3698b8811ac5887c127ab2bbfc94d7f6dcbd554a_2_624x285.jpeg\" />**1600\u00d7733 150 KB**](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3698b8811ac5887c127ab2bbfc94d7f6dcbd554a.jpeg)\n\n[<img height=\"356\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8487c56a2a8f7c7f6dd102ad36e9a20b7459b041_2_624x356.png\" />**1458\u00d7832 92.8 KB**](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8487c56a2a8f7c7f6dd102ad36e9a20b7459b041.png)\n\n### Voting behaviors for a 50M proposal shouldn\u2019t carry over to a proposal that includes the additional backfunded amounts.\n\nDuring our consultation process, we engaged in numerous discussions that brought forth questions about backfunding. Despite the criticisms, backfunding remains the most straightforward method to address the current STIP\u2019s skewed sample size. We advocate that backfunding is the optimal approach to achieve the STIP\u2019s intended outcomes\u2014specifically, to examine the impact that incentives have on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, if the STIP continues without rectifying the issues with its sample, the analysis will be compromised by a significant methodological flaw. Backfunding is not just the \u201cbest\u201d option; it is essential for preserving the integrity of the STIP overall.\n\nVoting behavior might have differed if the budget cap were set at 75M or 100M. The only way to determine this would be to repeat the experiment with a raised cap (an option that is unfeasible as time travel has not yet been realized).\n\nIt\u2019s helpful for us to remember the original objectives of the STIP:\n\n* To provide incentives to a diverse and inclusive group of Arbitrum projects.\n* To quickly establish an incentives program that is in harmony with Arbitrum\u2019s values and constitution.\n* To generate robust, meaningful data to shape the future design of Arbitrum grants for projects of all types and sizes.\n\n# Motivation\n\n> Motivation - A statement on why the Arbitrum community should implement the AIP.\n\nHow can Arbitrum create an incentives structure to grow the ecosystem? STIP started when the community began investigating creative uses for incentives. A short-term program was devised to act quickly, collect data about how incentives are used by Arbitrum protocols, and learn from the results to design new programs and grow the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nAn unexpected budget problem caused many successful STIP applications to receive no funding. The real-world consequence of this mistake caused the STIP sample to be cut in half - but not at random. To determine the final STIP cohort, the applications were sorted by approval, which inadvertently skewed the sample towards incumbent protocols. This sampling bias is most egregious for collecting data about the smallest protocols; over 70% of Beacon grants were rejected due to the sorting algorithm that was used. Consequently, STIP may not be collecting sufficient data about new builders on Arbitrum.\n\nThis AIP seeks to achieve STIP\u2019s original motivations by:\n\n1. nearly doubling the sample size;\n2. adding protocols across a broad array of industry categories; and\n3. including protocols at different stages of development.\n\nThis AIP will ensure an important builder population is included in the study, while increasing the validity of the STIP results.\n\nOne of the most important questions facing Arbitrum today is how to grow the ecosystem and win the L2 Wars. STIP is a novel study on the impact of incentives for growing the Arbitrum ecosystem. In practice, the STIP excluded most new builders from the study, severely limiting the data that will be collected about the early stages of the builder pipeline. This AIP includes a broader range of protocols in the STIP study, ensuring that Arbitrum gets the data it needs about how incentives impact new builders in the Arbitrum ecosystem. It stands to reason that extending incentives to smaller projects could serve to incubate projects that grow into the high-usage dApps of tomorrow. Extending the STIP may not only increase the inclusivity of the program but also incentivize significant growth for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem at a lower cost per project, and this possibility is worth exploring.\n\n# Rationale\n\n`Rationale - An explanation of how the AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values`\n\nArbitrum\u2019s community values highlight the importance of diversity, which increases the fitness of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem by representing the needs of many kinds of participants. The original work to design STIP was careful to consider how both large and small protocols would fare under the framework. However, the unexpected budget cutoff caused the sample to skew towards large protocols, which is at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community. The cost of falling short of this ideal is that STIP systematically overlooks the possibility that incentives might be uniquely interesting to small and new protocols. By failing to incorporate protocols at the first stages of the builders onboarding pipeline, Arbitrum will be unsure about how incentives operate among this crucial group of protocols.\n\nThe Arbitrum community also values neutrality, which received careful consideration during the STIP design stages. It was well-understood that incumbent protocols were likely to prevail with their STIP applications - but it was hoped this would not preclude smaller participants from also being funded. Unfortunately, this wish for inclusion was not fulfilled and - unintentional though it may have been - funding was nevertheless distributed according to a ranking that was likely to favor incumbents. Again, despite the best efforts of the DAO and the STIP designers, the result was at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community.\n\nAbove all, Arbitrum seeks to create and nurture a thriving ecosystem - and the DAO\u2019s values are designed to provide guiding values that will always trend towards the health of the ecosystem. When the values aren\u2019t met - even unintentionally - it is possible the best interests of the ecosystem aren\u2019t met, either. In the case of STIP, accidentally excluding Beacon grants falls short of the community values - which, in all likelihood, is a critical oversight that Arbitrum would benefit from fixing.\n\n# Key Terms:\n\n* Approved but not funded STIP proposals\n* AIP-9\n* Backfund\n* Extension\n* STIP\n* STIP Round 1\n* STIP Backfunded\n\n# Specifications:\n\n`Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.`\n\nWill approve funding of an additional 21.4M ARB through the end of January 31, 2024.\n\nPlease note the STIP Backfund will leverage the multiple sections of\u00a0[AIP-9\u00a01](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)\u00a0such as\u00a0[Specification section](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5)\u00a0and\u00a0[Outstanding Questions and Concerns](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#outstanding-questions-and-concerns-13)\u00a0and specifically:\n\n* [Financial Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5)\n* [Multisig Setup](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7)\n* [Eligibility Requirements](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6)\u00a0and\u00a0[Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7).\n* [KPIs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6)\n\nSteps to Implement - The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable.

    "description": "# Arbitrum Multi-sig Support Service (MSS) \n#### [](#final-version-jul-24-1)\n\n## [](#abstract-6)Abstract\n\nWe propose creating a structured multi-sig framework to facilitate funded programs within Arbitrum DAO to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency.\n\nAs of April 2024, the DAO administers six programs with a designated budget for multi-sig signing. The aggregate budgeted cost across these programs for signers stands at 158,000 ARB, with an annualized total expenditure, based on estimations, of 470,000 ARB or $627,840 at an ARB price of $1.34. This is a high cost for the DAO to pay on a purely operational function, especially **considering that these operational costs will likely rise as more programs are funded.**\n\nWe propose creating a \u201cMulti-sig Support Service\u201d (MSS) to unlock significant cost-saving opportunities, lessen committee fragmentation, ensure signers are competent with multi-sigs, and reduce friction for contributors creating proposals. The MSS will comprise 12 elected individuals to all DAO-funded multi-sigs. They will be compensated a base USD amount, paid in ARB, for performing these services across the DAO.\n\nThis proposal also funds the implementation of r3gen monthly Token Flow reporting on inflows (revenue) and outflows (spend) across the DAO as well as providing detailed information and analysis on spending from MSS multisigs. Together, this proposal will help create a \u201cbackroom finance\u201d function within the DAO that can be used across different initiatives.\n\nThe proposed changes offer the potential to generate substantial cost savings, estimated to be ~$315,000 per annum, while increasing efficiency, transparency, and security of DAO spending.\n\n## [](#motivation-7)Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO oversees six programs which pay multi-sig signers. Each multi-sig typically has five signers, except for the STIP and STIP backfund programs, which share the same multi-sig and have nine signers budgeted for. The table below outlines these programs, including the amount funded, duration (in months), and annualized figures to project a forecasted amount if future programs were to continue in the same manner.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the programs:\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 9.46.01 AM](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_689x263.png)\n\nThe analysis underscores the operational unsustainability of the current expenditure level, with an annualised cost totalling $627,840 USD based on the average ARB price of $1.34 between August 7, 2023 and April 30, 2024, the period starting when Arbitrum DAO\u2019s first multisig was funded.\n\nThe cost per transaction appears excessive when comparing these figures against the volume of unique transactions sent from each multi-sig. While analysis for all multi-sig wallets is included for completeness, the STIP/Backfund multi-sig provides the clearest picture of the \u201ccost per transaction\u201d due to its proximity to completion.\n\nThis analysis highlights the urgent need for restructuring and cost optimization within the Arbitrum DAO to ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency in the long term.\n\n![UTS](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_689x226.png)\n\n![AS CpT](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_690x253.png)\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that the current structure has individuals appearing across multiple different multi-sigs, drawing income from each.![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5_2_602x343.png)\n\nCurrently, the DAO experiences a significant dispersion in its structure, where each funded program operates its own multi-sig. This fragmentation not only leads to redundancy but also elevates the overall cost of operations. Through the \u201cMulti-sig Support Service\u201d (MSS), we can eliminate these inefficiencies and significantly reduce unnecessary expenditure.\n\nAdditionally, individuals on multi-sigs are generally not elected, posing a challenge in consistently ensuring that only the most trusted and competent members manage these critical roles. By shifting to an elected model within the MSS, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and professionalism, ensuring that every signer meets a high standard of trust and competency.\n\nFinally, contributors currently face friction in advancing proposals due to the need to wrangle signers, which can delay or deter the proposal process. The MSS aims to streamline this process by providing a reliable and consistent team of signers to be included in proposals, thereby reducing the time and effort of contributors, and accelerating the pace at which the DAO can execute its initiatives.\n\nBy creating a structured multisig committee, process, and reporting cadence around spending, the DAO will be better equipped to service its plethora of proposals that require payments and maintain transparency around the programs.\n\n## [](#proposed-solution-8)Proposed solution\n\nThe proposed framework for the Arbitrum DAO aims to address these issues by:\n\n1. Arbitrum DAO elects 12 signers via Snapshot weighted voting, shielded with Shutter\n   * Signers, when submitting their application to join the MSS, may opt in to be an MSS Chair, who will be responsible for communicating to the DAO on the MSS\u2019s behalf. The three opted-in signers with the highest weight according to Snapshot will be allocated MSS Chairs.\n2. For each new DAO initiative requiring a multisig, a new 12 signer multisig is set up.\n   * The signing threshold will be dependent on the total dollar denominated value of the wallet\n     i. 6/12: <$1M\n     ii. 7/12: $1M-$5M\n     iii. 8/12: $5M-$10m\n     iiii. 9/12 $10M-$50M\n3. Signers are paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB using spot price at the time of payment. The MSS Chairs will be paid $2500 per month in ARB using the spot price.\n   * We feel denominating the payment in a $ value is important to ensure the DAO pays a fair price for service rendered without the risk of ARB price movement leading to a series of overpayment or underpayment to signers for their duty.\n4. This will be paid out monthly from the MSS multi-sig, which will be a 6/12 including the entirety of the MSS.\n   * Payment for multisig signers will only start once the first new multisig is onboarded under the Multisig Support Service MSS structure.\n   * Existing multi-sigs have the option to \u201copt in\u201d to the MSS structure. If they do so any existing ring-fenced budget for multisig signing should be sent directly to a new MSS multisig. An MSS Chair will coordinate with the Program to manage the transition process. We expect a gradual turnover given the incentives at play and that most multi-sigs will not opt into the transition process.\n5. The same process is repeated to onboard new MSS members 12 months after the first is complete (starting the process 4 months before the term is up to allow for ample time)\n\n**The funds in the multisigs belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation.**\n\nWe suggest the program is capped at initiatives seeking funding of $50M or less. This will help ensure that the program is not bottlenecked by one single initiative. For programs seeking more than $50M in funding, we suggest inspiration in design be taken from this model while creating a dedicated multisig committee and process.\n\n## [](#mss-mechanics-9)MSS Mechanics\n\n#### [](#who-would-be-a-suitable-multi-sig-signer-10)Who would be a suitable multi-sig signer?\n\n* Actively involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* Prior experience being on multi-sigs. Understanding of batched transactions and transaction builder.\n  * All multi-sig signers will also undergo training on security best practices and multisig efficacy at the commencement of their role. This training will be completed by Entropy Advisors.\n* Able to complete KYC\n  * The Arbitrum Foundation will conduct KYC on all multisig signers to ensure they are compliant and can serve this role for the DAO.\n* Organisation or professional signers can submit a nomination to be a multi-sig signer. Only one member per organisation.\n  * If nominating an organisation, one member of the company should be listed as the primary point of contact.\n\n#### [](#creating-new-mss-multisigs-11)Creating new MSS multisigs\n\nThe process flow for creating new multisigs is as follows\n\n* Snapshot vote passes\n* Multisig is created by MSS Chair and signers onboard. The 3 chairs will rotate multisig creation responsibility\n* Proposal passes Tally\n* Vaults must be named well to help with organisation\n\n#### [](#processing-payments-through-mss-multisigs-12)Processing payments through MSS multisigs\n\nTo improve security and clarity of payments running through MSS multi-sigs, the following financial controls processes will be maintained:\n\n**Payment request: approval flow**\n\nAt the outset programs using the MSS will define their payment approval flow, including\n\n1. Which individuals can request a payment be made \u201cpayment requestor\u201d\n2. Which channel do they need to request it on \u201cpayment request channel\u201d\n3. Who else is required to approve it, triggering the payment to be queued via the multisig \u201cpayment approver\u201d\n4. A list of approved wallet addresses (maintained in On-chain Den)\n\nThis is an important security step to mitigate the risk that a Program member\u2019s personal accounts will be compromised and used to trigger a payment by the multisig to an unintended party. (i.e. hack someone\u2019s Telegram and tell the grants program to queue a payment up to the hacker\u2019s wallet).\n\nAn example of this structure\n\n1. Disruption Joe, Shawn and Ben can request a msig payment.\n2. Request made in \u201cPL Payment\u201d Telegram group\u201d\n3. Supporting evidence of the payment will need to be produced to be reviewed by the signers (a forum post, an invoice, a milestone sign off etc)\n4. One written approval as indicated by \u201c![:+1:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12 \":+1:\")\u201d on the payment message required from Joe, Shawn or Ben. \u201cpayment approver\u201d cannot also be by \u201cpayment requestor\u201d\n\nGiven the abstraction of responsibility from multisig signers and program operators, this step is important to ensure the security and integrity of fund transfers.\n\n**Payment request: format**\n\nPayment requests should be structured as follows by the \u201cpayment requestor\u201d\n\nName of supplier | Category | nature of the payment | supporting evidence\n\nThis will allow for multisig approvers to better understand the details of the payment they are being asked to process. Moreover, by ensuring clear supplier name and categorization a more efficient reporting flow can be maintained. The category of payment is to be defined by the program itself (i.e. \u201cTooling\u201d, \u201cContributor payment\u201d, \u201clegal fees\u201d). If the DAO wishes to move ahead with Token Flow reporting, r3gen finance will also conduct discovery with each program team to help them define and confirm program reporting categorization at the outset of their program.\n\n#### [](#payment-signing-den-implementation-13)Payment signing: Den implementation\n\n* To aid in the efficiency and security of multisig programs at Arbitrum, we propose the implementation of [Den](https://www.onchainden.com/) across all MSS multisigs.\n  * Efficiency: Den will automatically notify Arbitrum multisig signers when there is a transaction to sign. It will allow them to see exactly what you\u2019re signing at a glance and cut through the noise by auto-tagging and DMing signers\n  * Security: Den helps you know what you\u2019re executing and identify malicious transactions. It allows Arbitrum multisig signers to: Simulate and decode transactions before they execute them and see the outcomes of transactions before they are signed. It also helps signers easily understand complex transaction inputs and automatically see what\u2019s behind any address.\n\n#### [](#conflict-of-interest-policy-14)**Conflict of Interest Policy**\n\nIn order to maintain the integrity and impartiality of the MSS, signers must adhere to a strict Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy ensures that all decisions made by MSS signers are in the best interest of the DAO and free from personal gain or undue influence.\n\nA conflict of interest occurs when an individual\u2019s personal interests interfere, or appear to interfere, with their responsibilities to the DAO. Conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Being directly compensated by the Multi-sig: Receiving payments, reimbursements, or any form of financial benefit directly from the multi-sig for which the signer is responsible (Exclusion for the MSS multisig itself which will be paying it\u2019s signers directly for their services)\n2. Authoring a Proposal that Funded the Multi-sig: Proposals a signer has authored or co-authored, which directly results in funding or operational changes to the multi-sig.\n3. Personal or Financial Relationships: Having financial relationships with any parties that stand to benefit directly from the signer\u2019s decisions in relation to the multi-sig operations.\n4. Other Conflicts: Any other circumstances where the signer\u2019s ability to act in the best interest of the DAO may be compromised.\n\nProcedure in the Event of a Conflict: If a conflict of interest arises, or if a situation arises that could be perceived as a conflict, the signer must:\n\n* Provide Disclosure: Promptly disclose the conflict to the other members of the multi-sig committee.\n* Recusal: Abstain from participating in discussions and decision-making processes related to the conflict.\n* Reduced Signer Multisig: In the scenario that there is a situation deemed a COI, a multisig should be created without this signer(s) included. A new threshold >50% of the total remaining signers should be included. For example, if there are 3 signers with a COI for an initiative, the new multisig for this initiative would maintain 5/9 threshold and total signers.\n\nAll COI executions must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.\n\n#### [](#removal-of-mss-members-15)**Removal of MSS members**\n\nThere are 2 paths to the removal of an MSS member:\n\n1. DAO Snapshot: Any DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove an MSS signer. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. A simple majority of votes cast by the DAO members is required for the removal to be approved with an 80M ARB Quorum (defined as total ARB votes).\n2. MSS Member Agreement: If at least 8 MSS members (8 out of 12 members) agree that a signer should be removed due to breach of duties or conflict of interest, they can initiate the removal process internally. The agreement must be documented and publicly disclosed to maintain transparency. Analytics on signer activity from Den may be used as supporting evidence.\n\nIf a member is removed via the DAO Snapshot or MSS Member Agreement the member will immediately lose further compensation. Once a member is removed, the following steps will be taken to ensure continuity and maintain the governance structure:\n\n* Interim Measures: The MSS may appoint an interim member to serve temporarily until a new member is officially elected. The 3 chairs will collaborate and decide how to select the new member.\n* Subsequent Snapshot: A subsequent Snapshot vote will be held to elect a new MSS member. This ensures that the DAO participates in selecting a new signer, maintaining democratic and transparent governance.\n\nAll removal proceedings, details around the new signer, and the reasons for the removal must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.\n\n#### [](#expectations-of-mss-members-16)**Expectations of MSS members**\n\nTransactions are expected to be promptly (within 24 hours) reviewed by all signers, and if approved through the process outlined above, signed. While we realise that there will be times when a signer may not have internet access or some other deterrent to signing, these are expected to be few and far between. If there are more than 3 lapses in expectations over the course of a 2 month period, chairs are expected to communicate that to the DAO and potentially remove the signer.\n\n#### [](#clawback-capability-17)**Clawback Capability**&#xA;\n\n*We are in the process of implementing Zodiac Governor Module in the first multisig to so that the DAO has the ability to clawback funds and replace multisig members. Please note that the Zodiac Governor Module is an imperfect mechanism because it requires a DAO proposal to execute changes, and multisig signers can move faster than the DAO.*\n\nFor future multisigs, we believe each multisig should be set up with the DAO maintaining the ability to clawback funds. In order to execute this, multisigs should be set up using the same model as the security council, by making upgradeexecutor as a module so that DAO maintains full authoritative power.\n<https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/06039ce92be07d448838e4ab1e2e29c3985356f0/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L76-L95>\n\nWe believe this same mechanism can be used to transfer ownership of the multisigs to new members when new elections take place in 12 months.\u00a0*This might require a slight technical change,  we are awaiting confirmation from the Foundation.*\n\n## [](#token-flow-reporting-18)Token Flow Reporting\n\n#### [](#r3gen-reporting-on-token-flow-19)r3gen Reporting on Token Flow\n\n**Token Flow | Scope**\nTo aid in the transparency and clarity of reporting within the DAO, we are also proposing the publication of a monthly \u201cToken Flow Report,\u201d which will include illustrate expenditure amounts and breakdowns for all Arbitrum MSS-managed multisigs. In addition, r3gen finance will provide insights on inflows from Sequencer Flows and a high-level summary of other direct outflows from the Arbitrum Treasury to programs not coordinated under the MSS framework.\n\nThis approach will synergise with the operational execution created by the MSS to provide holistic insights into expenditures and the movement of Token in/out of the Treasury. Moreover, it will reduce the finance-admin burden on individual programs, relieving them of the need to track, draft, and publish exhaustive financial updates themselves whilst also providing the DAO with a clear mechanism to ensure spending within the organisation is consistent with the structure outlined within each proposal.\n\nWithin this role, r3gen finance will also lead the development of deeper financial insights and be open to requests by delegates and the community for further specific analysis. This can be requested either via a google form or by commenting directly on the report in the forum. Ultimately, this will enable the DAO to have, at it\u2019s fingertips, the detailed financial insights it needs to support decision-making.\n\nWith the inclusion of Token Flow Reporting, the DAO can unlock the next layer of accounting and reporting on top of the MSS and together creates a holistic backroom finance function to provide the DAO with much-needed data around spending. This will enhance the DAO\u2019s transparency, accountability, and impact.\n\nWe encourage you to review the [first iteration of the Token Flow report](https://online.flippingbook.com/view/939461097/) to get a sense of its design.\n\nMoving forward, financial items within the report will include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Transaction fees, split between the various components of the fee\n  * L1 base, L1 surplus, L2 base, L2 surplus fees\n  * Fee inflows into DAO-controlled wallets\n* Sequencer fees (L1 base fee)\n  * Fee outflows into the sequencer\u2019s wallet\n* Treasury holdings, including the breakdown of treasury allocation to various underlying tokens\n* Forward-looking spending estimations based on active proposals\n* Runway scenario forecasting based on historical/projected spend\n* DAO expenditure by:\n  * Category (such as user incentives, direct grants, grant programs etc.)\n  * Program (such as STIP, LTIP etc.)\n  * Function (such as committee members, advisors etc.)\n* Comparison of total proposed spend vs. actual spend to date for each major DAO-funded initiative, split between each function within the program where possible\n* Contributor Spending Analysis\n* Multisig Spend Analysis\n* Detailed Statement of Token Flows in each of the major tokens the DAO operates in, highlighting\n  * The starting token balance\n  * Inflows of the token (\u201cincome\u201d)\n  * Outflows of the token (\u201cexpenditure\u201d)\n  * Closing token position\n\nThis report is just the starting point. With community feedback, we will continue to develop and iterate on the monthly token flow report to provide deeper insights and analysis of what the community wants to see. This team will host a monthly finance call on the public calendar to discuss the report\u2019s outputs and collect community feedback to inform the next iteration.\n\nIf you have any specific feedback you would like to see reflected in the report we encourage you to reach out to Pepperoni\\_Jo3 or Jono\\_Gibbs on Telegram.\n\n**Token Flow | Team**\n\nToken Flow Reporting at Arbitrum DAO will be coordinated by a team of four (Elliott, Jono, Matthew and Pepperoni Joe) who bring professional \u201cBig Four\u201d expertise and extensive experience working across top web3 protocols, including Swell, Aave, Gitcoin, Index Coop, Inverse Finance, Squid, Vote Agora, Enzyme, Treasure.\n\n**Token Flow | Pricing for Token Flow Report:**\n\n$6650 USD per month paid upfront in ARB on the 1st of the month using USD/ARB spot price. This includes the web3 accounting sub-ledgers fee and other monthly tooling costs (approximately $750). Work has been ongoing since June to prepare the first Token Flow Reporting which will be published in August, covering the DAO\u2019s finances from Genesis to July 2024. The full monthly payment for August will be paid on the 1st of August, OR when the Tally vote is successfully passed and multi-sig set up to receive funds, whichever is latest. Work done to prepare the report through June and July will not be billed; that will be free on us (r3gen) for the DAO.\n\n### [](#estimated-savings-20)Estimated Savings\n\n**Current Structure**\n\nProject forward estimated multisig cost for the DAO is a challenge, but assuming multisig costs project in line with historical, some future scenarios of yearly cost are displayed below:\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 10.33.48 AM](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cdbcff5a6e9542b2bd21661eeeb7de9f1dff8ae0_2_690x191.png)\n\n\\*assuming ARB allocation cost per multi-sig breakdown as aligned with historic\n\nCurrent spend on multisig with Arbitrum DAO is high, and spending could increase significantly if the number of new multisigs or ARB price increases significantly. This indicates that implementing this proposal would be of significant financial benefit to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Proposed Structure**\nFor implementation of all aspects of this proposal, we estimate the structure will incur a cost of $313,800 per year.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/e2359ae9-327b-4203-9439-23789f17f6ce_original.png)\n\n[](#budget-21)**Budget**\n\nWe propose an allocation of 600,000 ARB to fund an approximately 1+ year multi-sig budget for the DAO. As compensation is denominated in $, but paid in ARB, the specific duration that this budget will fund signers cannot be accurately determined. Assuming the program succeeds, a renewal proposal will be drafted to top up this budget to fund continued signer payments. This will be done in parallel to a reelection process of signers performing this function.\n\n### [](#timeline-22)"

    "description": "# Long Term Incentives Pilot Program\n# Abstract\n\nThis AIP establishes a Long-term Term Incentives Pilot Program for the DAO to test new incentive designs and answer the necessary questions to ensure we are ready to commit to the long-term program. This Pilot Program will distribute a maximum of 45M ARB to protocols building on Arbitrum that were not funded during STIP or the Backfund. The program will distribute ARB to protocols for 12 weeks.\n\n# Motivation\n\n### Testing Incentives Mechanisms For a Long-Term Framework\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO has spent the last few months experimenting with incentive programs to attract new users and liquidity to Arbitrum. There is a consensus the DAO will use what we learn from these short-term programs to establish a long-term framework. While STIP V1 brought tons of attention to Arbitrum and has resulted in\u00a0[upticks\u00a01](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview)\u00a0in protocol metrics, we have learned there were many flaws with the structure of STIP Round 1. This Pilot Program looks to implement new mechanisms to address the issues seen during STIP. The DAO will use this Pilot Program as a test run for a long-term framework before committing to a year-long program.\n\nThe Pilot Program will operate using a Council, have Advisors to ensure protocols receive adequate feedback and assistance, and allow protocols more freedom to create innovative ARB incentive plans. We believe these changes will help remedy many of the pain points seen in Round 1. Running the Pilot Program to test these new features will allow the DAO to compare different program methods before implementing a long-term framework beginning in Q2 2024. This will help ensure we have all the knowledge necessary to implement the most effective long-term incentives program for Arbitrum.\n\n### Why Protocols Need a Round 2\n\nSTIP was an experimental program to distribute ARB to protocols to use as incentives for their users. While it was initially intended to have two rounds, the program was substantially more popular than expected, and the entire 50M ARB budget was used in Round 1 and an additional 21.4M ARB was passed through STIP Backfund for teams that were \u201capproved but not funded\u201d.\n\nThis meant no funds remained for Round 2, leading to its cancellation. Many protocols either missed the Round 1 deadline, intentionally waited for Round 2 or simply did not know about STIP. This left several protocols with no alternative route to apply for ARB incentives.\n\nMany STIP Round 1 grantees have seen\u00a0[upticks\u00a01](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview)\u00a0in their metrics. This Pilot Program would allow protocols that missed out on Round 1 the opportunity to apply to gain these benefits, which will help level the playing field for these protocols. The Pilot Program will replace a round 2 and will be funded with 45M ARB to accommodate the large expected protocol demand we have already seen. This will complete the incentivizing of Arbitrum-based teams to create a holistic competitive edge not against each other but against other chains.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThere is a DAO consensus that Arbitrum will need a long-term incentive program in 2024. However, many delegates feel the DAO is moving too quickly and spending too much money on backfund or V2 proposals without yet receiving any of the data on STIP\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nWe have learned a lot from STIP and can use what went wrong in STIP and the Backfund to hypothesize what changes would create a better long-term framework. However, we have little evidence to prove these new ideas would be a better solution. DAO members currently don\u2019t have the resources or funds to create a long-term program, nor do we understand what a good long-term program looks like.\n\nThis proposal focuses on obtaining this evidence using a committed working stream to guarantee we come away from this program ready to make informed decisions on a long-term framework. The pilot program also allows the DAO to test new aspects of an incentive program such as Advisors, Councils, and more flexible incentive distributions before committing long-term.\n\nThis will help save the DAO money and time in the long term by preventing the need for more short-term programs before we are ready to commit to the Long-Term Framework.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Problem / Solutions:\n\nThe specifications of the Pilot Program were designed to remedy the 3 largest complaints regarding STIP. The Pilot Program hopes to be a test run for these additions for the DAO to determine if they should also be included in the long-term framework.\n\n#### Problem\u00a0#1:\u00a0Too large a burden placed on delegates\n\nIn the original STIP, delegates voted on each incentive proposal individually, with almost 100 snapshot votes. This was extremely tiring for delegates and left many feeling they could not make informed decisions on every proposal.\n\n#### Solution\u00a0#1:\u00a0Elected council\n\nTo remedy this problem, the Pilot Program will have a 5 person council elected by the DAO responsible for evaluating applications and selecting which protocols will advance to a snapshot vote to receive ARB. This will ensure all applications are thoughtfully evaluated with only the most deserving receiving incentives. Not only will this help to reduce the burden on delegates, but it will also help expedite the process and allow protocols to receive incentives quickly and efficiently.\n\n#### Problem\u00a0#2:\u00a0Protocols did not receive adequate feedback on their proposals\n\nA major gripe from protocols was they struggled to get feedback from delegates before the deadline. This left many feeling as though the better-connected protocols had an advantage as they were able to modify their proposals based on feedback to make them more competitive during the vote. Many protocols were willing to make changes to their applications to make them more appealing to the DAO but never received the proper feedback necessary to do so.\n\n#### Solution\u00a0#2:\u00a0Advisors\n\nThe Pilot Program introduces Advisors to assist protocols throughout the pilot program. This will be impartial organizations tasked with providing each applicant with detailed feedback and guidance on how to improve their applications and eventually their incentive programs. This ensures each applicant can iterate on their proposal so they can put forward the best possible incentive plan for the council.\n\n#### Problem\u00a0#3:\u00a0Strict Limitations on Incentives Mechanisms\n\nSTIP Round 1 had strict limitations on how the ARB could be used as incentives. This was done to protect the DAO and prevent misuse of funds. However, the strict rules resulted in the stifling of many innovative incentive designs. Many protocols had interesting designs that used the ARB in ways that increased alignment, improved cost efficiency, or helped to limit the dumping of ARB. However, these designs were not permitted in Round 1 leading to almost all protocols resulting in generic liquidity incentive models.\n\n#### Solution\u00a0#3\n\nThe Pilot Program provides more flexibility to protocols to create innovative incentive structures. With the addition of the Council and Advisors, the Pilot Program does not require the rules to be as stringent. Malicious or inefficient designs will be first filtered out by the Advisors and then rejected by the council. Allowing protocols to innovate on incentive distribution mechanisms will allow Arbitrum protocols and community members to get a better idea of which designs work and which don\u2019t work. This will help everyone as we prepare for a longer-term incentives program.\n\n## Flow of Pilot Program\n\n#### Application Period (2 week)\n\nProtocols will have 2 weeks to apply using the Pilot Program application template. The application template will be created by the Council and the Advisors to ensure everyone has the same goals and make it easier for the council to process applications. Applications will be posted in the Pilot Program section of the Arbitrum forum. Protocols only need to post the initial draft of their application during this period. They will then have 2 additional weeks during the feedback period to edit their applications. No late submissions will be accepted.\n\n#### Feedback Period (2 weeks)\n\nDuring the feedback period, the Applications Advisors will provide feedback and guidance on all proposals. Protocols will be assigned an Application Advisor who will provide feedback and guidance on applications on a rolling basis. Protocols will then use this time to work with the Advisors to edit their proposals before applications lock at the end of the 2 weeks.\n\nProtocols can continuously adjust their requested ARB amounts until the feedback period is finished. No changes can be to the requested ARB amount during the screening period.\n\nStableLab will also read all submissions during this period and highlight any rule violations to allow applicants to edit their submissions to ensure they comply with all program rules.\n\n#### Screening Period (1 week)\n\nDuring this period, the council will use the pre-determined rubric to grade each protocol and decide which protocols will advance to the voting period to receive ARB. The Council will use the rubric to select which applications will progress to a snapshot vote. The protocols that the council selects to advance to a snapshot vote must have a total funding amount that is equal to or lower than the incentives budget. This will ensure the DAO does not overspend should all Snapshot votes pass. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThe rubric will be created by the Council and Advisors during the Tally voting period and will be publicly available by the time protocols begin to apply. The council will be required to publish a brief reasoning for all of their decisions on the forum to create transparency and accountability.\n\nThe council must judge applications as they are and cannot accept protocols at lower amounts than their application states. For example, if an application asks for 200,000 ARB the council can not fund them with 100,000 ARB\n\nEXAMPLE: This is a hypothetical example using a budget of 10 ARB with 50 applicants that each request 1 ARB\n\n50 protocols apply requesting 1 Arb Each \u2192 Council grades all 50 applications using the rubric and narrows the selection down to the top 10 applicants to not exceed the budget \u2192 10 snapshot votes are created to allow the DAO to confirm the council\u2019s decisions \u2192 9/10 Snapshot votes receive a majority of \u201cfund\u201d votes \u2192 9 protocols are funded with 1 ARB each and 1 Arb is returned to the DAO\n\n#### Voting Period (1 Week)\n\nUpon completion of the preliminary applicant screening process by the council, the selected applications will be formally presented to the DAO for consideration. Each application will then be subject to a voting process via Snapshot, allowing Arbitrum delegates to vote on the allocation of funds.\n\n#### Compliance Period (3 weeks)\n\nAll protocols that successfully pass the voting period will undergo a KYC period during these three weeks. Arbitrum Foundation members will reach out to coordinate these KYCs. All protocols will be required to complete the KYC during this period or they may be disqualified from receiving funds.\n\nOnce all KYCs are completed, there will be one vote to ratify the DAOs selection of screened and KYC\u2019d protocols. In the event that the Snapshot vote is favorably concluded, protocols will commence receiving its funding through an Hedgey stream, facilitated by oSnap execution.\n\n#### Incentives Period (12 weeks)\n\nSelected protocols will receive their requested ARB using bi-weekly Hedgey streams for 12 weeks. During this time, protocols will be required to provide bi-weekly updates on the progress of their incentives using a template created by the Council and Advisors. Protocols will be required to finish their incentive distributions or return any unused funds two weeks after their final disbursement is available.\n\nDuring this period Advisors will continue to work with the protocols to help them analyze and improve their distribution mechanisms. Protocols will be allowed to adjust their incentive plans as long as they do not violate any rules and provide their updated plans in their next bi-weekly update.\n\n## Roles & Responsibilities\n\n### The Council\n\nThe council will comprise 5 members. These members should be unbiased and knowledgeable builders, delegates, or organizations with experience in incentive programs, grants councils, or growing a protocol.\n\nThe council will decide which protocols will progress to a snapshot vote to be awarded the ARB incentives. The council\u00a0**does not need to spend**\u00a0the entire incentives budget should they feel there are not enough quality applications.\u00a0**Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO to be used in the Long Term Framework.**\n\nThe council members will be responsible for creating a rubric that all protocols will be judged against. The council will design this rubric with input from the Advisors and will communicate what they are looking for with the Advisors to ensure the Advisors guide protocols in the right direction. The highest-scoring protocols will progress to Snapshot votes to allow the DAO to determine if they should receive ARB. The council will be responsible for publishing the graded rubrics as well as a brief explanation for all decisions.\n\nThe council will also be responsible for determining when to halt a protocol\u2019s stream should they violate program rules or misuse funds. All reports of violations will be evaluated by the council. It will require 4 out of 5 council members to vote in favor of halting the stream for a stream to be stopped. Council members will coordinate with the multi-sig signers to halt a stream. Streams can also be halted via a DAO snapshot vote should the DAO disagree with the council\u2019s judgment.\n\n#### Council Not required to Use entire 45M ARB Budget\n\nWhile 45 million was the DAO\u2019s\u00a0[selected budget](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8112be08246466f870d0b91590fe99211f73d15cfdadac62ff3f1e6b2f74869a), the Council does not need to allocate the full amount. The council is responsible for screening applications and will only progress applications they view as worthy of moving to Snapshot. The total funding amount of applications moved to snapshot can be anywhere between 0 and 45M ARB. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO treasury by the multisig.\n\n#### Council Selecting Research Bounties\n\nThe council will create the RFPs for the research bounties.\n\nEach RFP will include the research question that should be answered as well as the maximum budget for the bounty. While there is 200,000 ARB allocated for research bounties the council does not need to allocate the entire budget. Arbitrum delegates will then select who will complete each of these RFPs via a snapshot election.\n\n#### Council Election\n\nThe 5 council members have been selected by\u00a0[DAO vote\u00a02](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc2d7ebf5ef78084b26544905fd6febf0b8256293ce7f67a71fdcdefc5e6284a4). The 5 Council Applicants with the most votes were elected to serve on the council for the Pilot Program.\n\nThose who serve on the Pilot Program Council are not guaranteed to be included on a council in the full Long Term Incentives Program. There will be new elections to select council members when it comes time for the full long-term program.\n\n#### Council Members\n\nCouncil members have been elected via\u00a0[Snapshot vote\u00a02](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc2d7ebf5ef78084b26544905fd6febf0b8256293ce7f67a71fdcdefc5e6284a4)\u00a0and are listed below.\n\n* GFX Labs\n* 404 DAO\n* Wintermute\n* GMX\n* Karel Vuong\n\n#### Council Conflict of Interest\n\nShould a Council member have a conflict of interest with an applicant they may excuse themselves from grading said applicant. A conflict of interest can include an investment or close personal ties to an applying protocol. Should this happen the council member will have to disclose they are not grading and provide a reason.\n\nShould there be a dispute over whether the circumstances qualify as a conflict of interest the other council members will vote on whether or not the situation warrants the council members abstaining from grading that applicant.\n\n#### Removing Council Members\n\nShould the DAO feel a member or members of the council are not fulfilling their duty they may remove them using a snapshot vote.\n\nAnyone with sufficient voting power can initiate a Snapshot poll to remove council member(s). Should the poll receive a majority \u201cremove\u201d votes the council member(s) will be immediately removed.\n\nShould this occur there will then be a week-long application process where replacement council members can apply via the forum. This will be followed by a Snapshot vote to elect replacement member(s)\n\n#### Council Cost Breakdown\n\nEach council seat will receive\u00a0**25,000 ARB**\u00a0streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nThe council will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize council members to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the council\u2019s responsibilities as well as the expected amount of time they will take to complete.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"492\" width=\"690\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.12 AM\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8c991eb08a48cd9ff205179caa08f132619b71bb_2_690x492.png\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8c991eb08a48cd9ff205179caa08f132619b71bb.png \"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.12 AM\")\n\n\n\n#### Council Responsibilities:\n\n* Design an application template and grading rubric with the help of Advisors\n* Grade all protocols against the rubric to determine who will progress to snapshot vote\n* Provide public reasoning for all funding decisions made\n* Decide whether a protocol\u2019s funding should be halted if they violate the rules or fail to distribute ARB\n* Create research bounty RFPs\n* Pick retrofunding mechanisms and allocations for the DAO to vote on\n\n### Incentive Advisors\n\n#### Overview\n\nThree Advisors will help protocols design, implement, and iterate their incentive programs. Advisors are integral to the proposal process, serving as impartial entities with DeFi expertise. Their primary function is to provide detailed, unbiased feedback on applications, aiding protocols in refining and improving their submissions.\n\nThe Advisors will also work closely with the council to create the application template and grading rubric. This will ensure the council and advisors are on the same page so they can provide the best feedback to applicants and ensure the council understands the details of the incentive mechanisms the Advisors are helping protocols design.\n\nAs this is an experimental addition to the incentives framework, having expert advisors working with protocols will help protocols and the DAO understand what is most helpful from an advisor and allow the DAO to adjust the role for the longer-term framework. This will also help protocols design more innovative incentive distribution mechanisms that can be tested to see how effective they are going into a long-term incentives framework.\n\n#### Responsibilities\n\n*Collaboration with Council and Program Manager:*\u00a0Work jointly to design the application template, KPIs, and a grading rubric, ensuring alignment with council expectations and clarity in the evaluation process.\n\n*Feedback and Recommendations:*\u00a0Offer detailed feedback on each eligible application assigned to your team during the review period.\n\n*Communication with Applicants:*\u00a0Engage actively with applicants to streamline the application process, aiding in proposal improvements and clarifications.\n\n*Hosting Office Hours:*\u00a0Schedule and conduct public office hours 3 times per week while the program is running for protocols to seek advice. This will focus on transparency and accessibility. All interactions during these sessions will be recorded and summarized for everyone. Order of speaking during office hours will be on a first come first serve basis.\n\n#### Expectations\n\n*Impartiality*: Advisors must remain unbiased, especially as they do not have the final say in proposal acceptance. While Advisors will work closely with the council members to create the Rubric, advisors should not interfere with the votes from the council nor guarantee any outcome to projects they speak with.\n\n*Continuous Engagement:*\u00a0Post-application feedback is crucial, as is ongoing involvement in the later stages of the process, subject to discussion and agreement with relevant parties. There may also be later involvement in the process when the program is running or over.\n\n#### Timeline and Process\n\n*Pre-Application Phase*: Advisors we assist the Council with the design of the application template and grading rubric. Advisors are required to hold open office hours, focusing on guiding applicants in preparing their proposals.\n\n*Application Review Phase*: Each proposal receives at least one detailed feedback report addressing key criteria established by the DAO.\n\n*Post-Application Feedback*: After the submission of proposals, advisors provide insights on the process and suggest improvements for future cycles.\n\n#### Selection and Ratification\n\nThose who serve as a Pilot Program Advisor are not guaranteed to be included onboarded in the full Long Term Incentives Program. There will be new elections to select Advisors when it comes time for the full long-term program.\n\nThe Advisors have been elected via\u00a0[Snapshot vote\u00a01](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1e5052579c5ed931f90e03e59f34274ba0a006093a6eeeab65e5e4df552668cc)\u00a0and are listed below.\n\n* JoJo\n* SEEDLatam Gov\n* Castle Capital\n\n#### Advisor Budgets\n\nEach Advisor will receive\u00a0**35,000 ARB**\u00a0streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nThe council will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize Advisors to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the Advisor\u2019s responsibilities as well as the expected amount of time they will take to complete.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"500\" width=\"674\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.58 AM\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f9656f0ade40e4b87036d5dc325caa53b90e2353_2_674x500.png\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f9656f0ade40e4b87036d5dc325caa53b90e2353.png \"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.58 AM\")\n\n\n\n### The Multisig\n\nA new multisig will be created for this program. A few individuals from the original\u00a0[STIP-ARB multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B)\u00a0used in Round 1 and the backfund proposal are now serving as council members in LTIPP which could create a conflict of interest. Additionally, a new multisig will help to prevent confusion regarding which funds are from STIP and which belong to LTIPP. Finally, a new multisig reduces redundancy of signers across multiple DAO programs which helps to protect the DAO by increasing decentralization.\n\nThe new\u00a0[multisig\u00a01](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=arb1:0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A)\u00a0will be a \u2157 multisig and include:\n\n1. Lindsey\n2. Limes\n3. Joseph\n4. Bobbay\n5. Alex Lumley\n\nMulti-sig address: 0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A\n\nThe funds in the multisig belong to the DAO, and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. In LTIPP, the council is responsible for deciding when to halt streams and can coordinate with the multi-sig signers so they can enact this request. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.\n\nThe multisig includes two features to ensure the accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1. Clawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2. Streaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grant\u2019s duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n#### Multisig Budget\n\nEach Multisig signer will receive\u00a0**1,000 ARB**\u00a0streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nIn LTIPP, the council is responsible for deciding when to halt streams. This has decreased a significant amount of the multisig\u2019s workload. Due to this, the budget has been lowered from the STIP budget.\n\n### Program Manager\n\nThe Program Manager will be responsible for coordinating between all parties involved to ensure the Pilot Program runs smoothly. They will be available to answer any questions the DAO has regarding the Pilot Program and will publish bi-weekly reports so the community understands the status of the program. This role is designed to add efficiency and clarity to all aspects of the Pilot Program. The Program Manager will have no input into which protocols receive funds. However, they will be responsible for handling any operational tasks that arise throughout the Pilot Program.\n\nMatt from StableLab will act as the program manager. StableLab will function in a similar capacity as they did for STIP Round 1. They will help coordinate between the multisig, council, Advisors, applicants, foundation, and community to ensure the Pilot Program program runs smoothly. StableLab will serve as a neutral party and have no power to decide which protocols receive funding or which streams are halted.\n\nStableLab was responsible for designing this Pilot Program and will continue working on designing a long-term Framework with the help of the incentives working group and the DAO. StableLab will be responsible for publishing a research report on the effectiveness of the Pilot Program and their findings on how it operationally compared to STIP V1.\n\nShould the DAO feel StableLab is not fulfilling their duties as program manager, they may remove them using a snapshot vote. An emergency Snapshot vote will then be used to elect a replacement program manager.\n\nIn the Long Term Incentives Framework, this position will be decided by the DAO. However, because the Pilot Program is intended to move quickly, it will continue using StableLab\u2019s services given they have experience from managing STIP V1 and already have knowledge from designing this process.\n\n#### Program Manager Budget and Responsibilities\n\nThe Program Manager will receive\u00a0**70,000 ARB**\u00a0total streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nThe Program Manager will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize Advisors to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the Program Manager\u2019s responsibilities and the expected amount of time they will take to complete.\n\nResponsibilityEstimated time SpentCompensation**Pre Application period*** Setting up council/advisor elections* Coordinating between council and advisors to ensure rubrics and templates are created* Connecting data provider to council and advisors* Preparing forum application set up* Creating systems for the Council and Advisors to track progress of applications40 hours per week for 2 weeks = 80 hours6,666.4 ARB**Application Period*** Guiding protocols on the application process* Checking Protocol eligibility* Providing announcements regarding stages of the application period* Coordinating and broadcasting Advisor Office hours to applicants* Connecting applicants to their Advisors* Assisting Council and Advisors to stay organized and ensure they are properly reviewing each applicant* Closing applications at deadline40 hours per week for 4 weeks = 160 hours13,332.8 ARB**Screening / Voting Period*** Providing operational assistance to the council to help with communication and process of screening protocols and protocols and release of rubrics* Coordinate between foundation and protocols to finish KYC* Preparing snapshot votes for protocols that pass the council screening process* Organizing Hedgey Streams for selected protocols* Answering questions from delegates regarding how to vote* Communicating with DAO to keep everyone updated on the progress of the program as well as which protocols will move to vote* Encourage delegates to vote plus guide them to applications/feedback to make informed choices.40 hours per week for 2 weeks = 80 hours6,666.4 ARB**Incentives Period:*** Help data provider connect with protocols to ensure proper data is collected* Coordinating and ensuring Protocols post their updates* Bringing concerns of misuse of funds to the council* Organize research bounty RFP selection process* Answer stream questions from protocols* Help protocols who have questions regarding the incentive rules/timelines* Addressing issues between protocols and their advisor* Provide Bi-weekly updates on the status of the program30 hours per week for 12 weeks = 360 hours29,998.8 ARB**Post Incentives*** Coordinating retroactive funding.* Coordinating Reflection Pieces from contributors* Conducting reflection interviews with applicants, contributors, and delegates* Providing operational reflection reports and recommendations for future programs.* Ensuring all unused arb is transferred back to the treasury40 hours per week for 4 weeks = 160 hours13,332.8 ARBTotal= 840 hours70,000 ARB\n\n### Data and Analytics Provider\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Pilot Program will onboard OpenBlock Labs as a service provider for data and analytics monitoring and reporting.\n\nTo optimize each initiative, the DAO must collect and analyze data regarding the efficacy of incentives. For the two prior incentive programs, the DAO has partnered with OpenBlock Labs to provide robust incentive data, which can be found\u00a0[here](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum). In addition to the data, OpenBlock provides biweekly updates to the forum, and has collaborated with dozens of protocols and delegates to share meaningful insights; our most recent analysis can be found\u00a0[here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblock-labs-bi-weekly-stip-efficacy-update-1-19/20759/1).\n\nIn the following section, we outline OpenBlock\u2019s scope for the LTIPP.\n\n#### Responsibilities\n\n***Incorporate Past Learnings:***\u00a0Collaborate with LTIPP advisors to strategically distribute incentive budgets across categories and protocols, utilizing insights derived from OpenBlock\u2019s STIP efficacy analysis. Our previous endeavors have uncovered millions of dollars in unoptimized spending, and we are confident that OpenBlock is well-positioned to guide the DAO in implementing improvements based on these insights.\n\nTo illustrate these insights more vividly, we present two examples of real scenarios within the STIP where OBL\u2019s recommendations could effectively guide substantial capital allocation in a meaningful direction, showcasing the potential ROI of OBL\u2019s work:\n\n***1. Concentration of Rewards:***\u00a0A handful of protocols have dispersed the majority of their rewards (50-70% or more) to a small group of users (less than 10). In such cases, the DAO is essentially committing millions of dollars to highly concentrated bets on user acquisition. Frequently, these major stakeholders have vested interests in the protocol, resulting in rewards flowing toward rent-seeking participants. The underlying data is available in the \u201cUser Claim Activity\u201d section\u00a0[here](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/claims).\n*2. Excessive Spending:*\u00a0Some protocols have distributed significant rewards without showing substantial additional growth compared to their pre-STIP trajectory, as observed in our competitive analysis control groups. Leveraging the data, OBL can offer insights on optimizing allocations and implementing mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of incentive spending. This includes setting specific performance targets to guide the continued deployment of funds. Since we have already spent a lot of time investing in these relationships with protocols, we are in a prime position to efficiently offer these services. The underlying data is available in the \u201cProtocol Metrics Normalized\u201d section\u00a0[here\u00a01](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview).\n\n***Protocol Data Aggregation:***\u00a0Interface with each protocol to audit and aggregate data on their KPIs. Monitor efficacy through a diverse set of metrics, mirroring the approach taken in the STIP (such as nominal TVL/volume/fees/DAU growth at the protocol level, normalized by claimed ARB, competitive intelligence, aggregated data at the category and ecosystem levels, etc.). Leverage any additional resources to help teams optimize their incentive mechanisms by building more granular insights. To provide more clarity on the resources required for this section, we have detailed the scope below:\n\n*Protocol-Specific:*\n\n1. Reach out and establish connections with protocols and their data teams.\n2. Audit existing queries for accuracy and relevance.\n3. Understand the KPIs and metrics associated with their queries.\n4. Build new queries or modify existing ones based on identified KPIs.\n5. Implement ETL processes. Manage separate ETL streams for teams with data in APIs or other platforms.\n6. Create visualizations tailored to each protocol.\n7. Collaborate with protocols to appropriately label their contract addresses.\n8. Flag any instances of misbehavior to the organizing team.\n\n*Aggregate:*\n\n1. Track the flow of funds within the protocols.\n2. Develop aggregate views based on the ecosystem.\n3. Conduct competitive intelligence analysis spanning various ecosystems.\n4. Generate aggregate views covering all categories within the ecosystems.\n5. Research efficacy metrics and establish normalization standards.\n6. Compile biweekly reports summarizing findings and insights. Engage with the community and iterate on findings to inform recommendations.\n\n***Making Data Publically Available:***\u00a0The Data provider will be responsible for making the data behind each dashboard publicly available. This will ensure those completing the Research Bounties have access to this information so they can provide proper analysis of this data. Easy access to data will allow for the Bounty completers to provide better reports and data visualizations for the community. This provides the DAO with a decentralized method for analyzing and understanding how effective this program is as well as better setting up the DAO for the Long Term Framework.\n\n***Monitor For Misuse of Funds:***\u00a0The data provider will monitor data from all funded protocols to detect any misuse of funds. Should they find suspicious activity the data Provider will be responsible for sharing this with the Council.\n\n***Create a Recap Report:***\u00a0The Data provider will be responsible for creating a recap report that tells the story of the Pilot Program and breaks down the successes and failures of the different incentive strategies.\n\n***Biweekly updates:***\u00a0The data provider will provide biweekly updates of the overall themes, trends, and findings from the program.\n\n***Interface with the council, advisors and protocols:***\u00a0The analytics providers have access to a wealth of incentive data, thus they are expected to leverage this data to provide feedback to teams who are designing incentive programs.\n\n***Interface with the research bounties and community:***\u00a0The analytics provider should work with the research bounty teams and any interested community members to ensure all data is open source and available for teams to access and interact with.\n\n#### Expectations\n\nImpartiality: The Data Provider must remain unbiased. While the Data providers will not have the power to halt streams themselves, they must be impartial when it comes to reporting the data and examining for any misuse of funds. Any suspicious behavior they find must be communicated to the council for further review.\n\nContinuous Monitoring: The Data Provider must continually update the data to reflect the latest updates. This will ensure the bounty researchers and community have access to the correct information. They also must continually monitor for misuse of funds to allow the council to act quickly should any issues arise\n\n#### Selection and Ratification\n\nThis will be an elected position in the long-term program. Additionally, given the long-term framework will have a much larger scope and will include many separate incentive categories, it will most likely require the DAO to onboard multiple different organizations to handle the long-term framework\u2019s data monitoring and reporting. However, because the Pilot Program is intended to move quickly, the Data provider will be selected and ratified by the DAO similar to STIP round 1.\n\n#### Data Provider Budget\n\nThe Data and Analytics Provider will receive\u00a0**100,000 ARB**\u00a0streamed throughout the program.\n\nFor this budget, OpenBlock Labs will commit 3 full-time equivalent data scientists.\n\nDuring this time they will be responsible for:\n\n* Using the data and learnings they gathered during STIP to:\n  * Help the advisors recommend strong incentive ideas to applicants\n  * Help inform the council as to what a quality applicant looks like\n* Meet with all successful applicants to create public dashboards displaying all required metrics\n  * Make the data open source so the research bounty teams have easy access to all data\n* Monitor all incentive programs for misuse of funds and report any finding to the council\n* Communicate with Research Bounty teams via telegram to ensure they have full access and understanding of the data that has been collected from the protocols\n* Provide Bi-weekly updates regarding the progress of the program.\n* Creating a final report with recommendations for how to structure future incentive programs.\n\n### Proposal Authors\n\nThis proposal has been continuously worked on by the authors since the middle of November after requests from the DAO emerged to create an alternative round 2 of STIP. The protocol authors have drafted the proposal, met with delegates for feedback, presented open workshopping calls, implemented feedback, and progressed the proposal towards a vote for the past few months. This funding section retroactively compensates the proposal authors for the hundreds of hours of work put into creating this proposal.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the three contributors as well as their time commitments over the past few months of creating this proposal.\n\nTotal Cost\u00a0**30,000 ARB**\n\nContributorResponsibilityEstimated time SpentCompensationStableLabAuthoring the proposal, leading efforts to gather delegate feedback, co-hosting workshop calls and working group pitches30 hours per week for 8 weeks = 240 hours15,000 ARBAlex LumleyAssisting in proposal design, leading efforts to gather delegate feedback, co-hosting workshop calls and working group pitches20 hours per week for 8 weeks = 160 hours10,000 ARBBobby BolaAdvising proposal design, assisting with delegate outreach and feedback10 hours per week for 8 weeks = 80 hours5,000 ARBTotal450 hours30,000 ARB\n\n### Research Bounties\n\nThe Pilot Program proposal will include research bounties to ensure the DAO collects sufficient data and draws meaningful conclusions from STIP, the Backfund, and the LTIP Pilot Program to help inform the future LTIP design. There will be up to 200,000 ARB available to those who complete bounties.\n\nThis process guarantees the DAO will have multiple teams working on providing meaningful conclusions regarding incentive programs. These conclusions will be essential to allow the DAO to possess all the information necessary to create the best possible long-term incentive framework.\n\nThe Council will be responsible for creating the research bounties RFPs that will include what question the research should answer as well as a maximum budget.\n\nSome possible questions the bounties could address are:\n\n* Which protocol incentive designs were most effective at attracting sticky users/liquidity?\n* What is an appropriate budget for a Long Term Incentives Incentive Program?\n* What was more effective the council or delegates voting?\n* What category of protocol received the most funding? Were any categories left out?\n\nNote: See more\u00a0[community-created research buckets in the forum here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/serious-people-research-bounties-for-ltipp/20378)\n\nResearchers will then apply to claim these bounties by providing why they are the best fit to answer the question as well as providing a budget.\n\nThe DAO will be responsible for selecting who completes each bounty based on the applicant\u2019s experience and proposed budget.\n\nThe 200,000 ARB is the maximum amount spent on research bounties. Should the DAO choose to fund lower budgets, any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\n### Retroactive Community Funding\n\nIn STIP Round 1 we saw many community members go above and beyond by providing valuable contributions without any funding. 100,000 ARB will be allocated for retroactive funding to community members who add valuable contributions during the Pilot Program. Earmarking these funds upfront lets people know there will be retro funding which will encourage community members to contribute. This section is intentionally vague to encourage all kinds of community contributions. The DAO will have the final say in how these funds will be used.\n\nThe exact methods used to distribute the funds will be selected by the DAO. The council will create a list of possible ways to retroactively distribute funds to those who have contributed to the Pilot Program. The DAO will then vote on which retroactive method(s) should be used. The DAO will also decide on who these retroactive payments will go to.\n\n### Arbitrum Delegates\n\nThis program is designed to reduce the large burden delegates faced during STIP round 1. While many of their responsibilities will be taken on by the Council and Advisors, the Arbitrum delegates will still retain the final say in many aspects of this proposal.\n\nDelegates will retain the following powers:\n\n* Elect Council Members and Advisors\n* Ratify all additional roles included in this proposal\n* Remove any position holder via a snapshot vote should the delegates feel they are not fulfilling their responsibilities\n* Vote on all incentive proposals selected by the council.\n* Select who fulfills the research bounties\n* Select the Method of distributing Retro Funding\n* Select who receives retro Funding\n\n## Eligibility Requirements\n\nThe pilot program is for protocols that did not receive ARB during STIP or the Backfund. However, protocols that received grants from the Arbitrum Foundation, Questbook\u2019s grant program, or any other Arbitrum Grants program are eligible to receive Pilot Program funding. Additionally, receiving funding from the Pilot Program does not prohibit protocols from applying for funding from other DAO or foundation programs including the Long Term Incentives Program.\n\n#### Additional eligibility requirements\n\n* Grantees must be live on Arbitrum at the time of application\n* Grantees must refrain from farming their own incentive programs.\n* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant\u2019s objective.\n* Grantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard.\n* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n* Grantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n* Grantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n* Grantees are expected to not encourage or partake Sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation to receive funds.\n* Grantees must apply using the approved program application template\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n* Any use of funds not explicitly described in the grantee\u2019s application.\n* Failure to comply with data reporting standards.\n  * Grantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams\n    * Dashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n    * More granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\n  * If dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\n\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* The Council and Advisors have already started creating the application template and rubric\n* When the Tally vote ends the Application period will begin the next business day. Protocols will apply using the application template\n* At the same time, applicants will begin the KYC process with the foundation to expedite the process should they receive funding.\n* The Advisors and the council will begin providing feedback on proposals on a first come first serve basis.\n* Once this proposal passes the on-chain vote, the total amount of ARB will be sent to the\u00a0[multisig\u00a01](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=arb1:0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A).\n* During the review period, the Protocols will work with Advisors to improve their applications.\n* During the review period, the council begins creating the research bounty questions.\n* All protocols that pass through the council screening phase, pass KYC, and sign grant agreements will move to a snapshot.\n* Applicants who pass the snapshot will have their streams automatically funded\n* Successful applicants will receive incentives for 12 weeks and will provide bi-weekly updates\n* The community will vote on who will fulfill the research bounties\n* The community will vote on Retrofunding\n* After the completion of the program, final reports will be posted to the forum\n* Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO\n\n# Overall Cost\n\n### Total Cost: 45,735,000 ARB\n\n* **Incentives**: 45,000,000 ARB. The entire budget does not need to be spent by the council. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO\n* **Council Members**: 125,000 ARB - 25,000 ARB each\n* **Advisors**: 105,000 ARB - 35,000 ARB each\n* **Research Bounties**: 200,000 ARB Total - the exact amount and sizes of specific bounties will be selected by the Council and can be vetoed by delegates.\n* **Data and Analytics Provider**: 100,000 ARB for data monitoring and reporting\n* **Program Manager**: 70,000 ARB for program design, organization, management, and research report. See the full list of responsibilities above.\n* **Proposal Authors**: 30,000 ARB Total. 15,000 to StableLab, 10,000 to Alex, and 5,000 to Bobby paid retroactively for writing proposals, hosting proposal office hour calls, and communicating with delegates to gather feedback.\n* **Retroactive Community Funding:**\u00a0100,000 ARB\n* **Multisig Signers**: 5,000 ARB - 1,000 ARB each\n\n# Voting Options\n\n1.

    "description": "# DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)\n# DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)\n\n## Non-constitutional\n\n### Change made on 6/02/25\n\nThe following language was added to the proposal:\n*\u201cThe DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it\u2019s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\u201d*\n\nThis proposal will proceed to Tally Thursday 6/5\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n\n* Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n* Added a clear responsibility for the program\u2019s successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n* Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy.\n* Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start.\n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15.\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The \u201c3-month\u201d timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season\u2019s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the\u00a0[Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849)\u00a0concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO\u2019s incentives framework. After analysis of\u00a0[Chaos\u2019](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515)\u00a0and\u00a0[Blockworks\u2019](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\u00a0incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum\u2019s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum\u2019s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. \u201cLooping,\u201d creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per\u00a0[IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum\u2019s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category\u2019s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto\u2019s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum\u2019s penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum\u2019s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Experiment and Iterate:**\u00a0Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n> * **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:**\u00a0Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n> * **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:**\u00a0This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:**\u00a0Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/7)\n\n> To summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program\u2019s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this\u2014protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher \u201csteady states\u201d compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> TVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> established protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> The proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP\u2019s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, \u201cIncrease trading activity\u201d, is not a specific goal, but \u201ccreate the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One\u201d would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting \u201ccritical mass,\u201d where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive \u201cseason\u201d is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season\u2019s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season\u2019s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs\u2019 operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program\u2019s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum\u2019s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n\u2154 votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it\u2019s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\n\nSnapshot: May 15\n\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates.\n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date"

The program has evolved and improved based on previous results, growing from its first season, which allocated $250,000 across four domains, to a second season with funding of $1,000,000 per domain.\n\nWe are now proposing a third season that would run for a full year, encompassing the existing four domains (Protocols, Education/Community and Events, Dev Tooling, and Gaming) with the addition of a fifth domain (Orbit), as per the[ <u>snapshot vote</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x052d7e9872192f46bfb4e0a2aabd07035d0842811ca1c82d654307b5d96e2e25). The vision is to create a modular program where new domains can be integrated over time based on DAO requirements and perceived needs. This new season will also improve tracking of grantee progress after funding and facilitate fast-tracking of exceptional projects into other DAO initiatives, such as Arbitrum Foundation programs and the GCP.\n\nQuestbook will serve as the technical partner of the program, offering their services through the Questbook.app portal.\n\n## **Season 1 and 2 recap**\n\nSeason 1 of the Grant Program was initiated through an RFC in[ <u>April 2023</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/14081?u=jojo), designed to serve four distinct domains: New Protocols and Ideas, Dev Tooling, Education/Community/Events, and Gaming. Following a successful[ <u>snapshot</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe07fb357b2b40e042ca58a36a1534afc33a1d313d4781ac433536bc884fc3c65) and[ <u>tally</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/52789605232046584393223454610845077119190920888046802640362214067679574612119?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) vote along with elections for the four DAs, the program officially launched in October 2023. The team consisted of[ <u>JoJo</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo/summary),[ <u>SEEDGov</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov/summary),[ <u>Flook</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/flook/summary) and[ <u>Juandi</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/juandi/summary) as Domain Allocators, with[ <u>Srijith</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/srijith-questbook/summary) serving as Program Manager.\n\nThe first season operated for six months with a budget of $250,000 per domain, totaling $1 million in funding, and implemented a soft cap of $25,000 per project. In April 2024, the program was[ <u>renewed</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98446466630612736687159241204141593794174501692677162686607521796118942563659?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) for Season 2 with the same team but expanded funding to $1,000,000 per domain. The soft cap was increased to $50,000, with proposals exceeding $25,000 requiring evaluation from two Domain Allocators.\n\nSeason 2 has now completed its fund allocation phase and will continue operating at reduced capacity for the next six months to oversee milestone completion and grant disbursement. Bear in mind that Season 2 results are partial from the first 6 months, and it will have its natural end in May 2025.\n\nThe following are the numbers so far achieved:\n\n* **Season 1**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 67\n    * Amount of completed projects: 49 / 73%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 8 / 12%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 6 / 9%\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 4 / 6%\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 207\n    * Amount of completed milestones 178 / 86%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 23 / 11%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $997,793\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $852,781 / 86%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $87,512 / 8.5%\n\n*Note: Uncompleted projects are those currently active but were either unable to complete their proposals within the last six months or pivoted to a different idea. Abandoned projects are from teams that weren't able to operate in the market. Withdrawn projects are those that were approved but decided not to proceed with their grant.*\n\n*While there was no specific timeline set, we feel Season 1 has come to its natural end, and we are in the process of informing teams and withdrawing remaining funds.*\n\n* **Season 2**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 140\n    * Amount of completed projects: 66 / 47%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 71 / 51%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 2 / 1.5%\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 1 / 0.5%\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 506\n    * Amount of completed milestones 357 / 71%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 149 / 29%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $2,841,027 / 92%\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $2,067,492 / 67%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $773,535 / 25%\n\nMore details on the results can be found[ <u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ts3oUeRy5cMp-5ksyld570VhmdjdUEVvtt2VhUYxfc4/edit?gid=1462691949#gid=1462691949).\n\n## **Season 3: overview**\n\nIn the last year, and potentially for the next year, the D.A.O. Grant Program has brought and will continue to bring the following value to the DAO:\n\n1. Introductory Grant Program: It fills the gap of Arbitrum Foundation grants (usually starting at $50,000, up to $150,000), serving as an entry-level program in our ecosystem.\n2. Transparency: All applications and judgments are available for everyone to read in the portal. Additionally, discussions with protocols are typically maintained in a public Discord with open access.\n3. Targeted Approach: The program has specialized in four specific verticals deemed key by the DAO\n4. High submission amount: between Season 1 and 2 we managed more than 700 proposals, approving around 200.\n\nWhile these points have always been advocated and envisioned as the natural shape of the program, below is a non-comprehensive list of value propositions that has been provided so far through in the last two seasons of the program:\n\n* Enable new teams and small builders to bootstrap their projects\n* Enable mid and big team to prioritize certain deployment in Arbitrum\n* Support Hackathon and Event winners\n* Provide an alternative funding route alongside the Arbitrum Foundation or direct DAO proposals\n* Support projects building upon targeted DAO initiatives\n* Ensure builder diversity, enlarging indirectly Arbitrum mindshare for local builders.\n\nA few specific examples of what we think can be defined as success stories:\n\n* Season 2 has supported both the[ <u>winner</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true) and[ <u>runner-up</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f30eb1c1eb9145098a15e\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66bbd4ee8868f5130a6ffe57\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true) of Arbitrum GovHack at EthCC\n* Curia's[ <u>Governance Dashboard</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66bdceb58868f5130a8cd78d\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true), initially[ <u>rejected</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x573c74706924ce482080ba44deb77d75e8d6bdb516fbbdee54b78861c1683f1b) by the DAO, has been later approved through the grant program with a 20% cost reduction\n* Pear Protocol, currently trading at $7.5M market cap with a $160M cumulative volume in 60 days in the perp space, received a grant to develop their[ <u>API module</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=0x538\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true) for market makers\n* Mountain protocol, rwa protocol having around $10M in liquidity in Arbitrum, has[ <u>bootstrapped its activity in Arbitrum through a grant</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=0x4ee\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true)<u> </u>in Season 1\n* Vyper, a language with an extreme mindshare in the Ethereum community, has seen[ <u>support to their compiler in Season 2</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f32a15488d5000f0562b3\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66a4e20af2fef64647207b3d\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true), which will help securing hundreds of millions in DeFi applications\n* Applications like FairAI's are building on top of initiatives such as LTIPP and STIP.b to improve the[ <u>discoverability of projects with incentives</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=663ec3d47d71679fa9a3852c\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true).\n\nIn this new iteration, the DA program will last one year. After two six-month seasons with subsequent renewals, there is sufficient maturity in both the program and the DAO to extend it, reducing the burden on delegates for operational renewal and addressing issues such as gaps between seasons.\n\nFunding will be proportional to Season 2, which effectively allocated $750,000 for each of the four domains for six months: for a one-year program, **the funding for the four base domains will be $1,500,000 per domain, plus further $750,000 for the Orbit domain, for a total of $6,750,000 for the four domains excluding OpEx**.\n\nThe grant structure will remain unchanged. Grantees can request up to $25,000 with a single DA review, and up to $50,000 with two DA reviews. Grants will be paid on a milestone basis, where projects must first complete the milestone, verify it with the DA, and then receive the corresponding portion of the grant. Only in exceptional cases, such as when milestone funds are essential for completion or in situations of economic distress, may the DA, at their discretion, release milestone funds in advance.\n\nUpon completing KYC/KYB, grantees will have up to six months to complete their proposal. If they fail to do so, remaining funds will be retained by the program and either reassigned to new projects or, if the program has naturally concluded, returned to the DAO.\n\nUpon proposal completion, grantees must publish a final report in the Arbitrum forum to inform the general DAO community about their project.\n\nThree months after proposal completion, grantees must complete a survey and publish an update to their final report, aimed at tracking their success, foothold gained in Arbitrum, and adherence to or pivot from their original idea. As mentioned below, we will also introduce a rule for which 10-20% (precise amount to be determined after internal discussion with the new team) of the overall grant will only be released after the completion of this further step, pending evaluation of the specific DA. This will ensure that projects will comply in drafting the documents requested by the grant, and ensure a better retention of projects after completion.\n\nBefore the natural completion, a subset of projects will be internally selected by the PM and DAs for fast-tracking through a PM pitch into other ecosystem programs, such as the Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program or the GCP. While this won't necessarily guarantee further grants from these or other entities, it will ensure exceptional protocols can continue their journey and expand within the ecosystem.\n\nWith these modifications, several gaps from previous seasons are addressed:\n\n1. Creating a checkpoint for approved proposals after their final milestone: This will enable better overall tracking of project outcomes.\n2. Integrating exceptional projects into DAO growth programs to establish a clear pathway for continued development within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n**Program phases**\n![Phases\\_of\\_the\\_program](https://static.tally.xyz/87a4bc29-1851-427b-9dfe-3d3293de2190_original.png \"Phases of the program\")\nExcluding the initial phases of snapshot discussion, temp check on the proposal, candidacy for DAs, elections for DAs, and on-chain vote, the program is articulated in the following phases:\n\n1. A first 1 year phase: during these 12 months, funds allocated to the program will be assigned to DAs to the projects that will be evaluated as worth financing. During this phase, the green one in the graph, all the team will operate at full capacity.\n2. A second phase, at low capacity, lasting 6 months: this phase is also effectively already embedded in phase 1. During this 6 months we will assume that there won't be any new fund to distribute from the main phase, and it will be a monitoring one. As stated, grantees, once approved and kyced, will have *up to* 6 months to complete their project. This means that projects approved, for example, in the last legal month of phase 1, will be able to complete their path up to 6 months after the end of phase 1. In this period, the team will work at low capacity, with a 20% cost.\n3. A third phase, potentially extending up to 3 months after the end of phase 2, related to the checkmark of projects after completion. If we consider a project that gets approved in the last month of phase 1, and needs 6 months to arrive to completion (so is completed in the last month of phase 2), we will necessarily have to place the checkmark 9 months after the legal completion of phase 1. Note: there is no opex coverage for this phase, since is effectively based on contacting projects, interviewing them likely with a google form and report in the forum, but only as said for projects that were approved in the last quarter of phase 1 AND that requires 6 months for completion (which is not always the case). This phase will be covered through the team which will have the goodwill of finishing to accompany projects in their path, and could potentially be resolved through the passing of the baton to a new team, or confirmation of the old team, in a season 4.\n\nDuring all of these phases, there will be parallel communication phases related to\n\n* the communication and reporting of the program in the forum: we need to, indeed, cover this for 12 + 6 + 3 months of the program\n* the communication with Arbitrum Foundation: as stated, upon completion, best of breed projects will be pitched to the AF to have them continue their journey in the Arbitrum ecosystem, either through a grant, or marketing, or any other initiative that the AF might deem necessary, knowing that this internal pitch might not necessarily spark any follow up\n* the communication with GCP, in the same fashion of the AF, once the fund will have their thesis and infrastructure up\n* any communication with any other stakeholder or initiative that might be deemed relevant by the team or the DAO.\n\n## **Domains**\n\nSo far the program has run with four main domains:\n\n1. New Protocols and Ideas: A general bucket encompassing not only protocols, but also platforms, governance tooling, and other projects not specifically falling into other domains.\n2. Education, Community Growth and Events: A domain focused on physical events and educational material for Arbitrum.\n3. Dev Tooling on One and Nova: A technical domain oriented toward developer tooling and promoting Arbitrum Nova adoption.\n4. Gaming: A domain dedicated to web3 gaming and infra, web3 KOL gaming activities, and all video gaming-related projects.\n\nAll these domains remain pillars of our DAO today, even more so than a year ago. We are, for better or worse (though mostly better), the most accessible DAO in crypto, the first ecosystem to create a gaming fund of the size of GCP, and we have a technology stack that enables permissionless creation of L3s. Our ecosystem's nature and soul, combined with the entry-level grant structure of this program and the diversity we inevitably achieve through it, provides strong justification to maintain all four domains. While most operational changes will be in the framework that moves projects from this program to others, we plan to specify domains based on relevant stakeholders\u2019 feedback (Arbitrum Foundation, OCL, Delegates) to add more specificity and better tailored results.\n\n### **Education, Community Growth and Events**\n\nThe domain has seen significant attention, receiving the highest number of proposals in both seasons. Through discussions with Foundation members and key stakeholders, two additional focus areas have emerged where the grant program can provide value:\n\nEvents Focus:\n\n* While continuing to serve the broader community, emphasis will be placed on amplifying Arbitrum's presence in key global markets and events\n* This will complement the Foundation's growth efforts in specific regions such as, in random order, SEA, USA, LatAm and others\n* The program will maintain an open approach, not limiting itself to these regions\n* Regular coordination with the Foundation's marketing department will help identify synergies between grantee proposals and events organized by the Foundation or other key ecosystem players\n* The DA will be mindful about any request of grantees for presence of personnel of the Arbitrum Foundation in the events: while this can, in some cases, be accommodated, is not always possible.\n\nDeveloper Relations:\n\n* Increased focus on DevRel content for both One and Stylus\n* Examples include, but are not limited to, video tutorials\n* Goal is to foster technology stack adoption through expanded community-created educational materials\n* This branch can partially overlap with and be covered/complemente by the Dev Tooling domain.\n\nTo reiterate: the domain won\u2019t change its nature to only serve requests such as the one mentioned in the above examples, but might give in some cases more weights in the evaluation as there is value added in coordination with the broad ecosystem. The DA will still retain all its liberty of evaluation.\n\n### **Gaming**\n\nThe gaming vertical has gained increased attention throughout the year in Arbitrum, partly due to the GCP initiative. Key stakeholders, including OCL, have identified a primary need: Arbitrum Games should begin targeting the web2 gaming industry, creators and gamers.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the grantee budget cap of $50,000 isn't sufficient to attract web2 developers, we can broaden the domain's scope by focusing on user acquisition through initiatives such as:\n\n* Content creation for YouTube and TikTok\n* Twitch streams\n* Other KOL initiatives targeting the web2 gaming segment\n* Grant proposal tuned toward KPI such as amount of reach, target impressions and others\n* Independent publications like newsletters, blogs, and channels.\n\nImportant notes:\n\n* The domain, while expanding, will still maintain its existing focus, which is financing teams to bootstrap or expand web3 games, web3 game related infrastructure and web3 gaming services in the Arbitrum ecosystem while expanding to include these new initiatives\n* Success on the expanded scope will largely depend on selecting a strong candidate or team with specific experience and reach in this segment\n* These requirements will be reflected in the election criteria.\n\n### **Dev Tooling on One and Stylus**\n\nThe Dev Tooling will undergo changes based on what the Arbitrum ecosystem has achieved, both technologically and in terms of PMF, in the last 12 months.\n\nNova, initially included in the scope, hasn\u2019t seen the forecasted adoption. At the same time we have seen a big conviction bet on Stylus.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t make sense to exclude specifically Nova, it can\u2019t be anymore one of the focus of the domain, which will be now called \"Dev Tooling on One and Stylus,\" incorporating the recent Stylus release. There shouldn\u2019t be any consistent overlap with the current year-long \"Stylus Spring\" program for several reasons:\n\n* Different funding amounts (up to $50,000 in DA program vs. potentially $200-500,000 for Stylus Sprint)\n* Different application windows (always open in DA program vs. 8-weeks application period in Stylus Spring)\n* Broader scope (Dev Tooling domain will likely continue to primarily operate on Arbitrum One).\n\nThe rubric will also be modified to put emphasis on Telegram\u2019s tooling such as trading bots, fairly available in other ecosystems but less widespread in Arbitrum.\n\n### **New Protocols and Ideas**\n\nThe \"New Protocols and Ideas\" domain will remain the most general capture-oriented domain, as it has been in the last two seasons. Its inherent generality enables it to cover both classic ideas, like financing DeFi protocols, and DAO-specific needs like governance tooling. This domain will remain largely unchanged, except for maintaining constant alignment with the Foundation and other stakeholders on what is considered important and valuable when assigning grants. Additionally, there will be attention paid to the evolving narratives driving the broader market.\n\n### **Orbit Chains**\n\nThe successful snapshot vote confirmed the willingness to not only renew the program for a third season, but also enlarge the scope with a fifth domain, which will allow for the creation of an Orbit track.\n\nThe Orbit Chains domain will have the mission to:\n\n* Enable Arbitrum protocols to expand their dApps to specific Orbit chains\n* Deploy technological solutions aimed at addressing current user experience fragmentation\n* Bootstrap solutions built on top of the[ <u>2024-205 Offchain Labs roadmap</u>](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/your-chain-your-rules-offchain-labs-technical-roadmap-to-fuel-arbitrum-innovation-f787f2e85966)\n\nThe Orbit chain domain won\u2019t cover the deployment of new Orbit chains, since this is a mission that is currently facilitated by the Foundation. This doesn\u2019t mean that a project can\u2019t have, in its milestone, the deployment of its own chain if that is part of a broader plan; but this can\u2019t be the main focus of the proposal. The rubric and template will be drafted in detail with the elected team member, following the same process used for the other domain rubrics ([<u>1</u>](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=66f2dec58868f5130ac75e42),[ <u>2</u>](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Domain-Allocator-info-0b00ff3a2ec4436f8fb5298c60c57b32),[ <u>3</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt),[ <u>4</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit?tab=t.0)), and will be ready by the start of the new season of D.A.O. grants.\n\n## **Modularity**\n\nSeveral parties have expressed interest in adding new domains to the DA program.\n\nWhile it wouldn't be wise to expand the program further at this time, new domains might be needed at different intervals, as illustrated by the Orbit domain example, where the DAO might require a new domain program six months from now. For this reason, Season 3 is designed to be modular.\n\nIf the DAO votes to allocate capital for a new domain, it can be integrated into the current program by leveraging the existing infrastructure and Program Manager. The costs for adding domains would vary based on specific implementation requirements:\n\n* For domains requiring no additional Questbook expansion and maintaining equivalent PM workload:\n  * Platform costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * PM costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * One new Domain Allocator required\n\nNote that new tracks may operate with their own independent teams.\n\n## **What does success look like**\n\nEvaluating success for an entry-level grant program can be challenging. The evaluation primarily focuses on three key metrics:\n\n1. **Number of Grant Applications**: The program has grown over the past two seasons with increased proposal submissions. We expect to maintain or exceed this level of interest. This KPI should be primarily compared to Season 2's metrics, as Season 1 had both lower funding and a lower cap ($25,000).\n2. **Grant Completion Rate**: As an entry-level program serving primarily small and new teams, the risk of incomplete projects is higher compared to more mature programs. The completion rate will largely depend on DAs' judgment in approving teams they trust to deliver. This metric should also be benchmarked against Season 2's performance for consistent comparison.\n3. **Long-term Project Sustainability**: A new metric will track how many teams are still building on their original project and remaining on Arbitrum three months after grant completion. As this is a new measurement not present in previous seasons, we won't have comparative data unless we retroactively measure Season 2 projects nine months after the natural end of that very season.\n\n## **Resignation of DAs and PMs**\n\nIn recognition that one year is a relatively long period for a DAO's program, procedures must be established for cases where team members cannot complete their tenure. If a member resigns, they will assist with the transition, and the team will attempt to source a replacement. A snapshot vote will be held with two options: \"Yes, proceed with the new member\" or \"No, hold elections.\"\n\nIf approved, the new member will be onboarded to the team. If rejected, a standard election process will occur over three weeks (two weeks for candidacy, one week for voting). During any transition period where the former member cannot fulfill their duties, the current DAs and PM will temporarily manage the domain, including grantee collaboration, proposal evaluation, and milestone payments. Any compensation due to the departing member during this interim phase will be fairly distributed among contributing team members.\n\n## **Budget**\n\nThe RFC will request $1,500,000 for each of the four domains \"New Protocols and Ideas\", \"Education, Community Growth and Events\", \"Dev Tooling on One and Nova\", and \"Gaming\", and $750,000 for the \u201cOrbit\u201d domain,\u00a0 for a total amount of $6,750,000 excluding OpEx. The requested amount will be in ARB and, upon receiving by an address controlled by the Arbitrum, Foundation, will be then converted into USDC. Costs are listed below; it is worth mentioning that these compensations are based on a standard hourly rate of $100 per hour, with the commitment of DAs being around 80 hours per month, and the commitment of the PM being between 60 to 80 hours per month.\n\nQuestbook Platform: $60,000 total ($5,000/month for 12 months)\n\n* Includes platform maintenance, improvements and bug management\n* Synapse subscription for KYC/KYB of teams and grantees\n* DocuSign subscription\n\nDomain Allocator Compensation: $528,000 total\n\n* $8,000/month for 12 months (five DAs)\\*\n* Plus $1,600/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n\nProgram Manager Compensation: $85,800 + 25,000 ARB\n\n* 25,000 ARB released upon successful voting\\*\\*\n* $6,500/month for 12 months\n* Plus $1,300/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n\nLegal Expenses: $30,000 earmarked.\n\nTotal operational costs: $703,800 + 25,000 ARB.\n\n*\\* If this on-chain vote is approved, JoJo, Juandi, SeedGOV, Flook, will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2 at the start of Season 3.*\n\n*\\*\\* the 25,000 ARB will be delegated by*[\\*\\* <u>JoJo</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/JoJo/summary) *to*[\\*\\* <u>himself</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0x4f685b29514eed0c9d929386e86d9cd81981118b)*<u>, and will be held as such for at least 180 days after the official start of the program.</u>*\n\n## **Reporting**\n\nA more clear and standardized reporting will take place going forward. Specifically\n\n* The PM will report, once per month, in the Arbitrum Governance call\n* This type of reporting might change format and/or schedule: if the DAO is interested, for example, it could be a specific DA call, or it might fall into any of the new governance DAO\u2019s calls that we could change or spin up in future\n* The PM and the DAs will publish, once per month, a single unified report highlighting the status of the program\n* All grantees, of all domains, at completion will have to publish a report in the Arbitrum forum\n* All grantees will have to follow up the aforementioned report, after three months, with a survey prepared to understand the effectiveness of both the grant itself and the idea from the team, including but not only understanding if the team has decided to keep building in Arbitrum, expanding in other chains etcetera.\n\n## **Operational changes**\n\nWhile in general there has been a very good reception of Season 1 and 2, there have been several feedback on how to improve the program moving forward. Addressing the gaps highlighted can be translated in three major areas of improvements.\n\n**Grantees Accountability**\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the DAO wants to have better results from the program, where better can be defined, among others, as more \"stickiness\" of teams that participate in the program, less frauds and scam which can be unfortunately quite common in low sized grant programs, and in general better results over time. For better accountabilities of the team these changes will be introduced.\n\n* KYC: it will be mandatory for two people on the team. The signed document will have to match one of the identities of the KYC members who kyced. This will add friction on whoever tries to impersonate others\n* Identity verification disclaimers: a clause will be included when filing for a grant, in which a team might optionally need to participate in video calls with the DAs with camera turned on. Failing to do so might lead to be rejected for the grant\n* Completion milestone: to increase the incentives for grantees to complete their proposal and to complete both the final report and the followup questionnaire, up to 15-20% of the grant will be released 3 months after the final milestone, pending evaluation from the main DA which will take in account the success of the project. In this way, not only we will have the complete documentation from the grantee, but also we will guarantee that a portion of the grant goes to teams that effectively keep going with their activity 3 months after the release of their product.\n\n**Improvement in operations for the program and the Domain Allocators**\n\nThere have been reports and feedback on how the DAs can better operate, and how the program could also improve through technological enhancements, to guarantee more quality in the program. The following will be implemented.\n\n* More in depth guideline for due diligence for DAs: DAs are not in the business of being on-chain sleuths or OSINT researchers, and so far most of due diligence was just based on the single experience of the person involved. Thanks to Entropy, we have worked together on a set of easy to follow but comprehensive guidelines to do due diligence on projects. This will give more confidence on the teams in the program being genuine.\n* Improvements in transaction execution time: to avoid bottlenecks in releasing grants, the structure of safes will be changed from the previous 2/2 to a 2/3 for each domain, with the main two signers being the respective DA and the PM, and a third backup signer being another DA. To increase security, any specific pair of DAs won\u2019t be a signer of multiple safes.\n* Improvement in how the Questbook platform generates the transactions: to mitigate and possibly avoid cases such as double transactions, we will require the Questbook team to improve the generation of transactions through their platform. Specifically, the message that is generated by signing a milestone directly in the platform won\u2019t be encoded but will be in clear text for the DAs to have a further way to verify that the milestone queued is the right one, as well as some other improvements such as checking if the address input by grantees is formatted in the right way for the system to ingest it.\n* Secondary ledger: the PM will keep a manually updated spreadsheet with all the transactions generated for each project.\n\n**Compliance to future DAO changes**\n\nOur DAO is evolving, and this is the first time we will have a one year long program. The current trend seems to indicate how several delegates might want to move toward a general standardization of oversight and reporting in Arbitrum. For these reasons, the following will be implemented.\n\n* Standardized communication format implementation: while the PM will regularly communicate to the DAO on a monthly basis through the governance calls and with a unified report consistent across all domains, the communications might change in the future in case the DAO will agree on a general standardized format cross-program.\n* Future oversight council compliance: as for comms, in case the DAO will agree on a general unified oversight unit, the program will adhere to it.\n\n## **Steps to Implement and Timeline**\n\n* 06th of February: Starts of the on-chain vote\n* 20th of February: end of the on-chain vote\n* 1st of March: official start of Season 3 of D.A.O. Grant Program\n\n## **Fund Management**\n\nThe proposal is requesting a total 23,426,465 ARB tokens, equivalent to the $6,750,000 for the 5 domains and the $703,800 for OpEx, including 35% as buffer at the current price of $0.43 per ARB token. In the aforementioned amount is also included the 25,000 ARB bonus. The 23,426,465 ARB will be sent to the address 0xb9a05fCcc841202f1ee0dEee557C6abE5cbb6615 controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation, which will send 25,000 ARB to 0x4F685B29514eed0c9D929386E86D9cd81981118B and take care of convertion of the tokens in USDC up to the requested amount of $7,453,800. Any surplus fund will be returned to the DAO:Upon completion, funds will be split as per the following\n\n* OpEx safe: managed by the MSS, it will be in charge of payment of suppliers and partners (Questbook, Synapse) and salaries\n* Domains\u2019 safes: managed by PM + DAs, one for each vertical with a 2/3 setup (the PM, the main DA, and a second different DA), will be linked to the specific domain through the Questbook website and will be used to disburse the grants. The safes will have the Zodiac Module for the clawback of funds."

    "description": "# Non-Constitutional: Stable Treasury Endowment Program 2.0\n# Abstract\n\nThis vote authorizes transfer of another 35 million ARB to a wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation for the next edition of the Stable Treasury Endowment Program ([STEP](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919)), to diversify Arbitrum DAOs treasury into real world assets that are stable in value, liquid in conversion and have yield uncorrelated to crypto markets. The goal of the STEP program is treasury diversification along with ecosystem growth for Real World Asset (RWA) protocols on Arbitrum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal kickstarts the second edition of the Stable Treasury Endowment Program, which aims to grow the RWA ecosystem (many of the top protocols do not need grants so much as AUM for their product) while simultaneously diversifying our treasury into stable, liquid and yield-generating assets (the volatility of the ARB token has highlighted the need for prudent diversification).\n\nThe RWA sector is growing at leaps and bounds with much room to grow even further considering the US treasury market by itself is $20 trillion. Arbitrum has [grown](https://x.com/EntropyAdvisors/status/1869053544164380848) from only $100k of RWAs in the beginning of 2024 to around [$150 million](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-rwa-case-study) today! Only 18% of this volume has come from the DAO itself through STEP 1, with the remaining TVL growing via organic means. To stay on top of this competitive sector, we need reliability and consistency in the programs we run for this vertical.\n\nAt the same time, we have seen increasing interest in treasury diversification initiatives across Arbitrum DAO. STEP follows 3 clear principles in dealing with service providers proposing to help with Arbitrum treasury diversification;\n\n* Directly own the process of selecting stable assets providing yield rather than delegating to a treasury manager (no point paying 1% AUM for them to hold low-risk assets on our behalf).\n\nThe STEP program is an example of how this can take place: an RFP under which projects apply with their product; a committee to review applicants; a program manager to monitor selected products\n\n* Diversify the treasury in a manner that also promotes ecosystem growth, by conducting a highly competitive and rigorous  process where the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO selecting a provider is as valuable as the business they get\n\nAccordingly, have projects directly apply in a competitive process on our forum if they want us to diversify into their product and be ratified in some way through a vote, not privately approach a treasury manager to get included\n\n* Take advantage of rising markets to steadily build up an endowment that can cover ARB DAO expenses from yield earned.\n\nPassage of this proposal will bring our endowment near the $60 million mark: $30 million from STEP 1, ~$10-15 million from the [treasury management initiative](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/111105159609719390908725919603971316574753860587890014819515615630412225940809?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) and now STEP 2\n\n# Rationale\n\nIn mid-2024, Arbitrum DAO [diversified](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-committee-recommendations/25097/36) $30 million into stable, liquid & yield generating RWAs. A comprehensive RFP process was undertake, where the DAO received 33 applications from RWA issuers, of which 16 were shortlisted and 6 were finally selected for allocations: Securitize BUIDL ($9.57 million), Ondo USDY ($5.22 million), Superstate USTB ($5.22 million), Mountain USDM ($3.48 million), OpenEden TBill ($3.48 million), and Backed Finance bIB01 ($3.48 million). These allocations helped us diversify the treasury into dollar denominated assets, got selected providers to launch on Arbitrum and are expected to generate a yield of roughly $875k for our treasury (live dashboard to track yield [here](https://dune.com/steakhouse/step-dashboard))\n\nThe 1st program narrowly targeted low-risk and liquid instruments (primarily US treasury bills and money market instruments). STEP 2 will have a similar scope of products. We explored other markets but see biggest benefit in Arbitrum doubling down on the same instruments as STEP 1 and exploring other RWA sectors after they have had time to mature. After all, 99% of RWAs on Arbitrum are still U.S. Treasuries\n\nOverall, this proposal aims to achieve 3 broad objectives;\n\n* Show that Arbitrum has a plan for the RWA vertical and projects in this sector should build on our chain, by building a regular cadence to the STEP program as the flagship program for RWA support\n* Let the DAO directly own stable RWAs through a competitive selection process for providers, instead of paying 1% AUM to treasury managers for selecting and holding low risk assets on our behalf. Use yield from the products to cover operational expenses by sweeping it as USDC to the ARB DAO treasury.\n* Provision funds ahead of time for optimal execution and take advantage of tailwinds when they arise for diversifying the treasury. Building up an endowment will let us weather even bear markets from an abundance mindset.\n\n# Specifications\n\n* We will transfer 35 million ARB to a foundation managed wallet (0x54FE3425f09854E15081fa5B3276afCB4C46FCa2). See confirmation here: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-stable-treasury-endowment-program-2-0/26819/81\n* The foundation will at their discretion liquidate the ARB and once complete, announce the average conversion price on the forum\n* Service providers who applied in STEP 1 will have to simply communicate what has changed in their product. Ample feedback was provided to all applicants, so if they have not managed to address the concerns we do not need to re-review applicants. New applications will be reviewed fresh. The RFP will be similar as STEP 1 with some modifications that will be included in the tally vote.\n* The committee may at their discretion review investments made in STEP 1 and propose re-allocations from providers selected in the earlier edition. High preference will be given to providers that already have their RWA product launched on Arbitrum.\n* The selection committee will be same as last time with one major change: Entropy will replace Steakhouse Financial who will not be a voting member due to also being the STEP program manager.\n\nSo the committee will be composed of @GFXlabs , @northlakeslegal , @Nethermind , @Entropy and @karpatkey , with Devansh Mehta from the Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability Group as non-voting facilitating member (except in case of tie) to communicate with service providers, the DAO and the foundation. As program manager of STEP,\u00a0[@steakhouse](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/steakhouse)\u00a0will be privy to committee discussions as an observing member but not have decision making power.\n\n* Funds are allocated to selected providers after ratification by the DAO\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* A snapshot vote approving in principle a STEP 2 for first half of 2025\n* A tally vote with the RFP service providers can apply under that authorizes transfer of funds from the treasury to a Foundation controlled wallet\n* Call for applications from service providers\n* Committee review of applications\n* DAO approval of committee recommendations on Snapshot\n\nTimeline\n\nForum Discussion: September-December\nJanuary: Snapshot vote (COMPLETE)\nJanuary 28th: Put for vote on Tally\nFebruary 20th to March 20th: Call for Applications\nMarch 20th to April 20th: Committee Review\nMay 1st: DAO Ratification of Committee Recommendations on Snapshot\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nDiversification budget: 35 million ARB, same as STEP 1\nImplementation budget: 125k ARB\n\nSimilar to STEP 1, a rate of 25k ARB x 5 committee members (GFX, Northlake, Nethermind, Karpatkey and Devansh Mehta from the Arbitrum T\\&S WG as facilitating member; Entropy to waive compensation)\n\n10k ARB will be given upon completion of work and the remaining 15k ARB will be vested over 3 years  using Hedgey so that it can be delegated to increase voting power.\n\nRough budget estimates\n50 applications\n2 hours for 25 applications with few updates.\n6 hours for remaining 25 new products/drastic changes.\nTotal: 200 hours.\nAnother 20 or so hours for all the deliberation, selections, allocation decisions we have within the committee.\nAverage rate of $100-$150/hr would be between 25-33K, downsized to 25k ARB (10k on completion and 15k over 3 years).&#x20;\n\nWhile the price of ARB is now lower, we are keeping the same amount of 25k ARB so as to not deviate from the pay received in  STEP 1.\n\nSTEP has developed a reputation of having a ton of due diligence. We think this is a good flag to hold high, since the benefits from being a STEP recipient go beyond just the amounts we allocate to also the legitimacy of passing heavy scrutiny by our committee. Service providers have also expressed appreciation on the feedback they got on their product, which in many cases led to different design decisions by their team.\n\n# RFP for STEP 2\n\nFor products that applied under STEP 1 and wish to re-apply, we ask that they comment under their old application in the Arbitrum governance forum with the following details;\n\n1. Start with a table of changes narrating all that\u2019s different compared to last time. If you would like to know the reason for rejection in STEP 1, message\u00a0[@TheDevanshMehta](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/thedevanshmehta)\u00a0on telegram.\n2. In the application form, whatever details have changed should be in a different color or highlighted in some fashion so the committee can easily know what is the same as last time and what is new.\n3. Updated and latest documents that you prefer not made public on the forum but which you want the committee to consider should be sent to [rwa@dao.arbitrum.foundation](mailto:rwa@dao.arbitrum.foundation)\n\nFor new applicants, we ask that they create a new thread on the forum with their application here: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/step-applications/\n\n**Who Should NOT apply**\n\nFollowing learnings from the first edition of the program, we advise the following products to refrain from applying;\n\n* Proportion of RWA is less & de-fi or crypto angle too high\n* Involves equities having high volatility\n* Not dollar denominated with foreign currency risk\n* A derivative product or wrapper that is majorly built from other onchain RWAs\n* Not launched yet\n* Requires bridging to other chains. As the Arbitrum RWA space has matured since STEP 1, high priority will be given to products launched on Arbitrum by March 15th 2025\n* Requires continual active decision making & operationally burdensome, for example individual issuances maturing without auto-roll\n* Transparency issues such as: black box setups, multisig in control of executive team without legal protections, product is complicated with risk difficult to quantify.\n* Products with a tiny AUM, exposure to a single ISIN or having fund managers without extensive prior experience or outsourced to third parties\n* Insufficient separation between fund manager and investment manager\n* No investment restrictions, especially worrisome if a provider can use leverage and hedging at discretion of the manager. We need something beyond common sense that stops a provider from taking our money and putting it into Argentinian peso bonds.\n* Insufficient documentation such as not providing a PPM, investment memo, counterparty for reverse repos, guidelines, restrictions, having annual audits only or from unknown auditors or managers\n* Redemption procedures have a lag period measured in weeks or months or are limited to a single stablecoin that is not USDC, USDT or DAI or require a bank transfer\n* Decentralized governance of underlying assets which require additional due diligence and/or have exposure to the Foundation add an extra layer of unpredictability\n* Judged as not being bankruptcy remote, opening risk of creditors taking our funds in case of disputes. This criteria includes both service providers in a jurisdiction that is uncomfortable for the committee and segregated portfolio companies with multiple portfolios.\n\nBankruptcy remote is not just having separate bank accounts, creditors look at whether entities are in actuality separate (their own board meeting minutes, payroll with staff, etc) so that the subsidiary entities do not get rolled into the parent one during proceedings.\n\nIf you think all these criteria are met, please read the application form below to send in your application.\n\n# Request For Proposals: Arbitrum Treasury Diversification (STEP 2)\n\nTable of contents\n\n1.

Supplementary\n\n**Summary and Arbitrum info**\n\nIntroduction Arbitrum governance is seeking proposals from qualified applicants for the purposes of diversifying the governance treasury and supporting ecosystem growth.\n\nThe purpose of the RFP is to identify products that provide trading volume and depth (i.e., liquidity), are stable in value, produce income for governance independent of crypto market volatility, offer transparency, and can potentially see use in developing a nascent \u201creal-world assets\u201d sector on Arbitrum chains.\n\nApplicants whose products meet certain quality thresholds will be presented to ARB holders and their delegates for possible asset allocation. All final asset allocation decisions rest with ARB holders and their representatives. This RFP is intended to both collect relevant information for the committee and also to recommend allocations for tokenholders to vote upon.\n\n**Requester background**\n\nArbitrum governance maintains and upgrades the Arbitrum technology stack, upon which are built multiple blockchains, including the largest Layer 2 on Ethereum, with more than $2.8b in assets onchain.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Asset information**\n\nThis program is intended to convert 35,000,000 ARB into stable, liquid and yield earning assets. The dollar notional amount of this investment is subject to market volatility, but at the time of January 16th 2025 is valued at approximately $26.46 million. These assets do not have a specific futured obligation or liability they are matched against. The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands legal entity, will be the transacting counterparty.\n\n**Oversight**\n\nThe committee is comprised of 6 members including GFX Labs, Entropy Advisors, Karpatkey, Nethermind, and North Lakes Legal. The Arbitrum Treasury & Sustainability Working Group also serves as a non-voting member of the committee, except in the case of ties.

    "description": "# Transfer 8,500 ETH from the Treasury to ATMC\u2019s ETH Treasury Strategies\n### Non-Constitutional\n\n## Summary\n\n* Entropy proposes transferring 8500 ETH accrued from Sequencer and Timeboost Revenue from the DAO\u2019s treasury to the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council.\n* At the time of writing, the DAO Treasury has ~10.5K ETH unallocated to any treasury strategies. This capital is currently sitting stagnant, and could be much more valuable and functional for the ecosystem within the ATMC, generating yield and increasing the DAO\u2019s ETH holdings\n* An added benefit of activating ETH from the treasury is the potential to support liquidity in venues within the Arbitrum ecosystem to supplement increased activity from DRIP, while not receiving or diluting any of the incentives (the DAO\u2019s allocations would be excluded from ARB rewards).\n* The ATMC has generated just over 43 ETH to date (beginning May 2025) by activating idle ETH from the treasury, with a 30D lookback APY of 2.43% on ETH-denominated strategies at the time of writing.\n  * At current 30-day-average annualized rates (note: proposed treasury deployments will not necessarily be in identical allocations), an additional tranche of 8500 ETH allocated to comparable-yield strategies could make the DAO an extra 204 ETH over the next year, or ~$891k at current prices.\n* The DAO treasury value is still highly concentrated in ARB tokens, and all efforts to diversify and increase the quantity of non-ARB tokens in the treasury that also support broader ecosystem growth should be considered.\n* Although the prospective increase in ETH is very marginal against the treasury concentration of ARB, these initiatives help grow non-ARB assets without requiring spot sales of ARB, continuing a long-term path to prudent diversification.\n* Deploying a portion of this idle capital to the ATMC is aligned with treasury management best practices: principal preservation, yield generation, and ecosystem support.\n\n## Motivation / Rationale\n\n**Opportunity Cost and Past Performance**\n\nAt present, over 10,000 ETH sits idle in the treasury, generating no yield and contributing minimally to the growth of the ecosystem. Allocating a portion of this to yield-generating strategies is in line with treasury management best practices.\n\nSince May, the ATMC ETH-denominated strategies have generated 43.4 ETH, utilizing AAVE, Fluid, Camelot, and Lido. Performance and a detailed breakdown of the ETH allocations, as well as other treasury strategies, can be seen\u00a0[here.](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-treasury-management-program)\n\nAssuming a prospective allocation of 8500 ETH and a conservative ETH-denominated yield of ~2.4% (illustrative figure based on the 30-day average annualized yield for existing ATMC strategies), the DAO is foregoing approximately 204 ETH annually, which is $891k at current market prices. Even at the lowest 30-day average annualized yield rate of 2.04% (recorded July 15th), the projected opportunity cost of letting this ETH sit unallocated is 173 ETH, or $756k at current market prices.\n\nFrom a treasury management perspective, maintaining a large passive ETH position without a corresponding yield strategy is suboptimal, especially when there exists a variety of deployments that would be appropriate to allocate it to, including but not limited to native staking, restaking, DEX liquidity provision, and lending market supply.\n\n**DeFi Ecosystem Support**\n\nThis proposal is in direct strategic alignment with the current DRIP campaign, fulfilling treasury management\u2019s dual mandate of:\n\n1. Generating yield and growing/diversifying the treasury\n2. Supporting growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem, particularly within DeFi\n\nA major goal of the Arbitrum DRIP program is to spur activity within the broader Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem, initially focusing on boosting leveraged looping strategies within DeFi utilizing yield-bearing collateral. Decisions regarding these funds will prioritize supporting these initiatives where possible, deploying productive capital across various venues, though this will not take absolute precedent over existing considerations regarding risk, liquidity, partnership opportunities, sustainable yields, etc.\n\nSome indicative examples of DRIP-aligned treasury strategies would be supplying unstaked ETH to lending markets, or staking ETH with LST/LRT providers, and exploring adding DEX liquidity across native ETH and LST/LRTs pools. With some of these strategies, we can ensure that users who are looking to participate in DRIP have ample liquidity, and we can even make an impact by stabilizing lending market utilization rates, reducing borrowing costs or slippage.\n\nAs with prior deployments, we intend to communicate with prospective partner protocols to negotiate terms beneficial to the DAO or reduced costs on any deployments when possible or appropriate.\n\n## Specifications\n\nEntropy proposes that the new tranche of 8500 ETH be used in a variety of generally lower-risk, ecosystem-supporting protocols, including but not limited to\n\n* Liquid Staking\n* Liquid Restaking\n* Lending Markets\n* Liquidity Provision on DEXes\n\nThe 8500 ETH is not intended to mirror the existing treasury strategy deployments, unless extenuating circumstances indicate these to be undoubtedly the best option to support the ecosystem and generate risk-adjusted returns. The DAO\u2019s wallets will be blacklisted from receiving any possible DRIP incentives.\n\nFor this proposal, we will not be conducting an open RFP process for protocols to apply for funding. Entropy will proactively engage with protocols providing services that align with our strategic goals. To have full confidence in the deployment of this capital, evaluations of various strategies will heavily take into account criteria such as protocol maturity, ecosystem impact, yield sustainability, and economic and smart contract risk.\n\nAs structured in the\u00a0[ATMC proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-management-atm-council-details/29626), the elected OAT body will maintain full ability to approve or deny granular selection decisions. No allocation can be made unilaterally by Entropy. Funds will be sent to and custodied by the Arbitrum Foundation. Rebalancing needs will be examined as part of our normal treasury management reporting cadence, considering liquidity constraints, yield conditions, or shifts in ecosystem needs.\n\nGiven that the 8500 ETH requested represents a material portion of the non-ARB, unallocated treasury funds, capital preservation and long-term impact remain primary priorities. The following\u00a0**benchmarks**\u00a0guide Entropy\u2019s allocation strategy:\n\n* **ETH:**\u00a0stETH staking APY (currently ~2.56% based on 30D average)\n* **RWAs:**\u00a0Avg APY of Largest Onchain U.S. Money Market Funds (currently ~4.11% based on 30d average)\n* **Stables:**\u00a0USDC Supply APY (most liquid lending market on Arbitrum and currently ~4.54% 30D average)\n\nEntropy recognizes and agrees with delegates that at certain times a deployment to support ecosystem growth should be prioritized over a pure yield strategy. Our team weighs growth opportunities against foregone yield based on a few factors:\n\n1. **Estimated Value of Growth:**\u00a0Does the estimated dollar-denominated value of the ecosystem opportunity directly outweigh the forgone yield. Elements that influence the estimated dollar-value of the opportunity include growth potential, broader ecosystem synergies, competitive landscape, and potential onchain fee impact.\n2. **Pricing the Opportunity Cost:**\u00a0Evaluating the opportunity cost for specific growth allocations based on the established benchmark rates. This involves looking at the expected yield and rewards, required deployment size, and time to deploy/remain allocated.\n3. **Comparative Effect on DAO Income:**\u00a0The opportunity cost is scaled based on its influence on the DAO\u2019s total income. As Arbitrum\u2019s total revenue increases, it allows for more opportunity to pursue growth. The percentage of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s top-line revenue foregone for an opportunity is a factor in when a strategic deployment makes sense. An opportunity with more substantive impact as a percentage of total revenue has a higher required perceived value versus cost multiple to be deemed worthwhile.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Forum Period September 16th - September 25th: Requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions.\n2. Snapshot: September 25th - October 2nd\n3. Tally: October 16th - 30th\n4. Following a successful Tally vote: Begin deploying capital once OAT greenlights a granular allocation list"

    "description": "# AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency\nCategory: Non-constitutional\n\n## Abstract\ntl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation\u2019s \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation\u2019s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup \u2013 linearly unlocking over 4 years \u2013 alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation\u2019s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\n## Motivation\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n- Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n- Control over the DAO treasury\n- Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n- All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n- Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain\u2019s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that\u2019s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum\u2019s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## Rationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation\u2019s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation\u2019s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\n- Operating Budget: Cost ($USD)\n- General and Administrative: $16,000,000\n- R&D: $9,000,000\n- Technical Infrastructure: $5,000,000\n- Events, Marketing & Communications: $6,000,000\n- Total - Next Twelve Months: $36,000,000\n- (50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation\u2019s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation\u2019s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation\u2019s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation\u2019s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation\u2019s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup).\n\nLinks:\n- Snapshot temperature check: [https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae)\n- GitHub PR: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44)\n- Forum discussion thread: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1)\n"

    "description": "# ArbitrumDAO strategic \u201cOff-site\u201d (online) updated proposal\n# ArbitrumDAO strategic \u201cOff-site\u201d (online) updated proposal\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## Context\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the directional proposal for an offsite which was voted in favour with 130mn ARB in Snapshot:\u00a0[ArbitrumDAO Off-site - Directional proposal 8](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site-directional-proposal/25660)\n\nAnd a following proposal where an Online format came on top\u00a0[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8f242363dbc69d640799b461b27ba7b957ab13af87389b699639ba335b8b5e91)\n\nThe proposal has been streamlined based on feedback and is designed to be independent but compatible with related initiatives such as Alex\u2019s work on coordination and emergent conversations with Disruption Joe, etc. The proposal also stays clear of areas where Entropy is already working and builds upon previous work (e.g. mission and values draft).\n\nThere were concerns about potential overlap with GovHack and we have aligned this initiative so both could be complimentary. However,\u00a0[the HackHumanity team has announced they won\u2019t be organising an event for Devcon\u00a01](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-devcon-in-bangkok-hack-humanity/26634/71).\n\nOffcylce voting: this proposal was planned to be launched on Tally yesterday. Due to some unforeseen coordination around the MSS, we couldn't post until confirming the compliance procedure with the foundation. In the interest of being ableThanksgivingto start this initiative in October and due to multiple constraints in November (DevCon, ThanksGiving), we're posting on Tuesday. Please accept our apologies for any disruption.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates). The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured process will be organized in October (before DevCon), focusing on strategic alignment sessions.\n\nThis proposal includes:\n\n* Stakeholder management (preparation and follow-up): delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to scope and prepare the most important agenda items to be discussed during two online workshops (building upon the survey and analysis already carried out). And post-workshops follow-up on key action items, including snapshot vote to ratify decisions.\n* Facilitation: design and execution of a strategic process to advance alignment, convergence, and prioritization, ensuring clear next steps.\n* Coordination: with Entropy to build on top of the work on mission, vision, and values; and with with additional emergent initiatives (e.g. Joe and Disruption Joe proposal in the works and potential future proposals by HackHumanity and others).\n\nThe key deliverable is an online strategy process to define a shortlist of priorities for the DAO over the next 6 months.\n\nThe success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions. The key outcome is a ratified decision on priorities via Snapshot vote.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. There are many calls, but attendance is not concentrated and the calls are designed for context sharing and informal discussion, not designed for a strategic process. This results in a gap in aigment and clear and explicit strategy, causing slow decision-making.\n\nAreas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. Beyond what can be achieved in an event, these areas require multiple steps of aligment on frameworks and approaches, sense-making, structured deliberation, and ratifying decisions.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Output:**\n\nDraft of DAO priorities for the next 6 months that\u2019s put to a Snapshot vote.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe priorities provide alignment and enable the whole community to rally around key priorities, unblocking the DAO.\n\n**The proposal includes:**\n\\*The exact format will be refined during phase 1 in coordination with other initiatives and delegates.\n\n1. Agenda prioritisation (pre-event alignment) and sense-making.\n\n* Project manager to engage with token holders, delegates, and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitating converging on the exact agenda and framework.\n* Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format. This is a continuation of the work started in December with the pre-proposal for a strategy framework.\n\n1. Strategy Sprint: 2 week process combining live and asynchronous components to integrate broad community input and feedback, deep dives by representative stakeholders, and converging towards a clear list.\n\n* Onboarding participants into the framework and using a collective intelligence tool to generate and organise an initial list of priorities. (asynchronous, 1h)\n* Online workshops to review the initial list, carry a root cause analysis, and argue pros/cons of different priorities. (live, half day)\n* Sharing publicly for community feedback (forum) and our team synthesising feedback.\n* second survey (usign the collective intelligence tool) to collect, cluster, and prioritise a refined list of priorities. (asynchronous, 2x 1h)\n* second workshop to refine the definition of the priorities. (live, half day)\n\n1. Post workshops follow up\n\n* Sharing a summary of the discussion & agreed action points.\n* Final collection of feedback and synthesis.\n* Snapshot vote to ratify the results of the workshops.\n* Follow up with participants a month after to track progress on action items and liaison with Entropy, Foundation, and other parties to suggest next steps as appropriate (e.g. aligment with HackHumanity if GovHack is approved).\n\n## Timeline\\*:\n\n\\*: tentative timeline to be adjusted during the planning phase in coordination with the different stakeholders.\n\n* First two weeks of October: planning\n* Last week of October: hosting 1st workshop\n* Throughout November: async coordination period\n* Late November to early December: second workshop and snapshot proposal.\n\n## What Does Success Look Like?\n\n* Alignment on DAO priorities for the next 6 months.\n* Engagement from top delegates and key stakeholders.\n* Clarity provided to the broader communtiy enabling them to rally around priorities.\n* Positive feedback and a strong desire to continue similar initiatives.\n\n## KPIs:\n\n* Snapshot proposal: post-workshop to ratify results.\n* 50%+ participation rate among engaged ([35%+ on-chain voting rate 2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates)) Top50 delegates, foundation, off-chain labs, and additional nominated participants.\n* NPS of 50 or more (-100 to 100 range, 0 considered average)\n* A similar initiative is organised again.\n\n## Attendees\n\nFocused on high-context, expert, and senior participants. I.e. not an onboarding event.[\u00a0For rationale see the discussion here.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-offsite-format-online-vs-irl/26629/61)\n\n* Open to\u00a0[Top-50 delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates), off-chain labs, foundation members, and top 100 ARB token holders (both in Arbitrum One and Ethereum).\n* Additional attendees based on at least 20 million ARB endorsements (holders/delegates can endorse as many participants as desired).\n\n## Budget\n\nFund sent to Multisig Signing Service.\n\n50% in advance (pending KYB with the Foundation), 50% upon completion.&#x20;\n\n30% volatility buffer added in case of the ARB price falling. Any unspent buffer will be returned to the DAO. Arb price calculated based on date of posting on Tally.\n\n&#x20;Cost: $14,900\n\nTotal in ARB including volatility buffer: 30,266 ARB\n[Detailed breakdown\n](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V_awuFbTKamI9DYNZ-249WXJ2TA24mQLIBGfRnEKmBQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAdditional 5k ARB bonus if snapshot proposal with priorities (proposal to ratify conclusion of the workshops) is approved (non-constitutional quorum met and 65%+ support from voters).\n\nMaximum possible total in ARB (with bonus and max buffer): 35,266 ARB\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n### Facilitation\n\nThe opportunity cost of this process is easily 10x its budget, given the limited time availability of delegates and few occasions a year when they converge. As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the process is effective. The facilitation includes designing the workshops and moderating the conversation, AND engaging with the broader community to gather input and synthethise it.\n\n### Agenda\n\nWe\u2019ve already started the process of setting the agenda. We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.\n\nPre-selection of topics in ranked order:\n\n* Defining strategic priorities for the DAO\n* DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)\n* Org Design\n* ARB token utility\n* Conflict Of Interest\n* Grant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)"

Remaining ARB will be sent back to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury.*\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nAs voted on in the ADPC proposal [<u>here</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/43616303506326656287362617487331059827021737444126158637397168372555259240241), one of the key tasks of the ADPC was to conceptualize and structure a subsidy fund for the Arbitrum DAO. As per the [<u>proposal </u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd45c0426919353cbce3e7e2a3e7a00c01f9d606bb7ed6c9788db4598f044b16a)passed on 25-Apr-24, the Arbitrum DAO will fund 1 cohort of 8 weeks (2 months) for a total fund size of $2.5 million worth of ARB.\u00a0\n\nFollowing the rejection of this [<u>proposal</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x285a0ef00fabce6e1d44b10ffff9fff5a30f62649339cfeded113e23bc58cdf1) which sought to set up a Sub-Committee for the Security Services Subsidy Fund based on community feedback received, the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018ADPC\u2019) will be responsible for facilitating the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC\u2019s procurement framework, as originally proposed in the [<u>Subsidy Fund Proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958?u=sid_areta).\u00a0\n\n**Proposal Request**\n\nWe propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating up to $2.5 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThese subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.\n\nThe aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.\n\nA benchmarking exercise was conducted with various security audit service providers, with this [<u>form</u>](https://noteforms.com/forms/subsidy-fund-service-fee-consultation-mtg039) being shared with 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated. Based on this, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 12 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.\n\n**Subsidy Fund Design & Approach**\n\n**Exec View**\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Up to $2.5 million worth of ARB allocated to spend on whitelisted security audit service providers, with an average amount of $200K worth of ARB allocated per project and a max cap of $250K per project (10% of the subsidy fund available).\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ADPC will be responsible for selection and oversight.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Subsidy Fund will be distributed across 1 cohort of 8 weeks.\u00a0\n\n**Key Pillars**\n\n**(A) Subsidy Fund Principles and Criteria**\n\n**Core Principles Underlying the ADPC Subsidy Fund**\n\nBefore considering a subsidy application, applicants should carefully evaluate the need for support. The purpose of these guidelines is to clarify the subsidy program and make the process as straightforward as possible.\n\nAll applicants should keep in mind the following key principles:\n\n1\\.\t**Transparency & integrity** - Applicants must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and receipt of any prior funding.\n\n2\\.\t**Encouragement of investment** - Subsidies should incentivise investment that would not otherwise occur without the subsidy. They should not cover costs that the beneficiary would have funded independently in the absence of any subsidy.\n\n3\\.\t**Proportionate and necessary** - Subsidies should be proportionate to their intended objective and limited to what is necessary to achieve it.\n\n4\\.\t**Economic neutrality** - The requested subsidy amount should not confer an economic advantage. It should be provided on fair terms, comparable to what could reasonably be obtained on the market.\n\n5\\.\t**Consideration of funding options** - Applicants are expected to explore all available funding options and responsibly choose the option that best suits their needs.\n\n6\\.\t**Enhancement of beneficiary security** - Subsidies should bring about changes that enhance the security of the beneficiary\u2019s protocol.\n\n7\\.\t**Positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem** - Subsidies should have a beneficial effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its growth and sustainability.\n\n8\\.\t**Value for Money** - The evaluation method should ensure decisions maximize both financial and non-financial value to Arbitrum.\n\n9\\.\t**Probity** - Subsidies should be issued in an environment that ensures fairness, impartiality, and compliance with established guidelines and rules. There will be an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and integrity throughout the procurement process, evidenced by the development of this publicly documented Means Test methodology. This focus on Probity will mitigate procurement risks and safeguard the integrity of the procurement process.\n\n10\\. **Risk Management** - Risk management policies will be implemented to identify and mitigate procurement risks.\n\n11\\. **Engagement with SMEs** - We have invited a wide range of organisations to participate, all of whom will be subject to the eligibility criteria.\n\n12\\. **Cyclical Whitelist events** - We will have clear rules for cyclical whitelist reviews to open a pathway for future applicants and new market entrants.\n\n**Means Test: Criteria for Evaluation**\n\nThe reason for this approach over a purely quantitative approach is that most projects, especially the smaller ones being targeted within this subsidy program do not possess obvious immediately measurable metrics.\n\nThe development of this Means Test aims to provide a structured approach for the ADPC to evaluate applications for financial assistance. This tool is designed to identify applicants who would benefit most from support, ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, particularly for smaller entities with valuable contributions.\n\nThe intent is to allocate subsidies to those most in need, avoiding exploitation by larger players looking for a \u2018free lunch/handout\u2019. Such an event could give recipients an unfair advantage over their competitors or be an inefficient use of the DAO\u2019s funds if they do not bring about a net positive change.\n\nThe means test will include a scoring system ranging from 1 to 5, reflecting the merit of each application.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rating 1: Unsatisfactory\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rating 2: Below expectations\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rating 3: Meets expectations\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rating 4: Above expectations\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rating 5: Exceptional\n\nEach of the sub-criteria in the means test have varying levels of importance, and they will each have a weighting attached. A weighting of 1 indicates low importance, 2 indicates neutral importance, and 3 indicates high importance.\n\nEach application will be scored by ADPC members, followed by a collective decision on the most deserving grant recipients, taking into account the rating against the eligibility criteria, a value-for-money evaluation and the funds available.\u00a0\n\nAfter the applications have been reviewed and decisions taken as to the grant beneficiaries, the average score assigned to each project will be shared publicly, ensuring that transparency is maintained throughout the process. In the event that an applicant receives a high score but is not chosen as a grant recipient, explanatory feedback will be provided either on an individual or collective basis to the cohort.\n\n**EVALUATION CRITERIA**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/183eecb1-da8e-4f44-b765-382856e3bb73_original.png)<img height=\"445\" width=\"714\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/f75882bb-4d50-4574-b052-3ac70a71d45a_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"667\" width=\"707\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/beaaf036-ae7e-46f8-91de-ac581b90721a_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"316\" width=\"685\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/b9768498-bdd5-4bcf-831d-4e3f5902d4b3_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"700\" width=\"682\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/12e204ca-2317-406e-a985-f3155a61f1cb_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"332\" width=\"680\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/bd8593cc-2843-45be-a2ec-127de568e880_original.png\" />\n\nRegarding the \u2018Ecosystem Contribution\u2019 metric above, we have conducted an initial assessment of the types of projects that are currently building in the Arbitrum ecosystem and identified a few verticals that the ecosystem would benefit from funding. These are set out below, along with the rationales for choosing them, providing more weight to such areas.\n\n*Note*: We have removed the Collab Tech and Gaming verticals which were present in the original proposal. There are a number of grants programs already centered around Collab Tech, while the Gaming vertical is sufficiently incentivized via the GCP.\n\n**RWAs & Tokenization**\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Commands a small proportion of Arbitrum attention and building however is a focus of big institutions & banks deploying large amounts of capital into tokenization.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Arbitrum as the home of DeFi is currently trailing in this burgeoning key category (e.g.,[<u> Mantle</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd) passed a $60 million support program for tokenized RWAs on their chain and Polygon and Avalanche have been very active in the space).\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tokenized treasuries and private credit have [<u>passed $1.3 billion in terms of value tokenized</u>](https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries), and are only projected to grow in importance in the near future, highlighted by the recent launch of [<u>BlackRock\u2019s</u>](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/20/blackrock-enters-asset-tokenization-race-with-new-fund-on-the-ethereum-network/) tokenized fund.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Forum discussions talking about RWA\u2019s being used as a tool for diversifying the Arbitrum DAO treasury. See[<u> here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-arbitrum-stable-treasury-endowment-program/20139).\n\n**Stylus Adoption**\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Stylus\u2019s flexibility, as detailed in this [<u>proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts-arbos-30/22970), allows developers to write smart contracts in Rust, C and C++, significantly expanding the developer base from an estimated 20,000 Solidity developers to include developers from other languages such as Rust and C++ which have around 3.5 million and 10 million developers respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Provides a more efficient execution environment compared to the EVM, resulting in over 10x cheaper computation and 100x cheaper memory usage. These improvements will lead to substantial gas savings for complex smart contracts, making previously impractical use cases feasible.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Enables interoperability between Stylus and EVM contracts, allowing developers to call Rust programs from Solidity and vice versa, seamlessly integrating existing infrastructure such as Oracles with new Stylus-based contracts.\u00a0\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Extends capabilities of the EVM without altering its core functionality, providing a long-term competitive advantage for Arbitrum by enabling higher throughput, lower costs, and supporting new use cases.\n\n**(B) Application Process**\n\n**Application & Review Windows**\n\nThe Subsidy Fund will run in 1 cohort of 8 weeks consisting of an initial submission period of 2 weeks, followed by a 6-week review period. This will operate on a first-come-first-served basis for application reviews.\n\n**Initial Screening**\n\nTo efficiently handle the anticipated surge in applications and to ensure that the highest quality and most relevant applicants are selected, the below 5 sub-criteria (with the highest weights as mentioned above in the Means Test) will first be applied to all applicants, with the top-scoring applicants moving forward in the evaluation process and being assessed in greater depth:\n\n1\\.\tFunding Gap Rationale\n\n2\\.\tReasonableness of Subsidy Amount Requested\n\n3\\.\tKPIs\n\n4\\.\tEcosystem Contribution\n\n5\\.\tAccountability Measures\n\n**In-Depth Review & Feedback**\n\nProjects that pass the initial screening will undergo a review due diligence (DD) by the ADPC, including interviews and constructive feedback (either individually or on a collective basis).\n\n**Award & Monitoring**\n\nOnce approved, projects receive subsidies, with periodic check-ins and a concluding evaluation to measure impact and success.\n\n**(C) Selection Process & Reporting**\n\nTransparency and continuous dialogue form the backbone of our selection and reporting process, ensuring that each funded project remains aligned with program expectations.\n\n**Reports**\n\nWe will provide updates on our selections and updates on funded projects. These updates will include general project trajectory and progress toward milestones. To create the reports we will set regular monthly check-in dates where projects fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project\u2019s status, such as:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Summary of Achievements for the Month\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Funds Utilized\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Milestones Reached\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Challenges Faced & Plan of Action\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Feedback Integration, i.e., how projects have incorporated feedback provided.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Next Steps & Priorities\n\n**Output Metrics**\n\nWith the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 **Number of Projects Funded:** Number of projects funded.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 **Total Funds Allocated:** Cumulative sum of funds distributed, showcasing the program\u2019s financial impact.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 **Percentage of projects funded in target verticals:** As outlined in the Means Test, the two key verticals we have identified are RWAs & Tokenization and Stylus Adoption.\n\n**Outcome Metrics**\n\nDepending on the final portfolio of funded projects, we will gauge the success rate of awarded projects through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on a project level, we are committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of our ability. Metrics include:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Percentage of funded projects successfully deployed on Arbitrum\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Percentage of KPIs outlined in the application achieved by funded projects\n\n**(D) Project Allocation**\n\nOur approach to subsidy fund allocation focuses on achieving high impact while ensuring that a de minimus number of projects obtain funding.\n\nTo ensure that the subsidy is spread across a large number of projects rather than concentrated in several larger projects, the maximum subsidy to be granted will comprise 10% of the subsidy fund available. Therefore, given that the subsidy fund comprises up to $2.5 million worth of ARB, the maximum subsidy that a project can receive will comprise no more than $250K worth of ARB.\n\n**(E) Team Setup**\n\nThe administration and selection process of these subsidies will be managed by the ADPC. Even though the ultimate decision will lie with the judgment of the ADPC, their assessment will be strongly guided by a means test that evaluates key metrics to determine deserving projects.\n\nThe activation of the ADPC to manage the Subsidy Fund will hinge on extending the current 6-month mandate once the Subsidy Fund becomes operational. Should the DAO or the ADPC opt against a continuation of the ADPC, a Subsidy Fund Management Committee will need to be elected. The ADPC will allocate ample time for this process to ensure the Subsidy Fund operation is not reliant on the ADPC\u2019s mandate extension.\n\n**(G) Governance**\n\nThe Subsidy Fund governance aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.\n\n**Multi-Sig**\n\nAll providers must undergo and successfully complete the standard Know-Your-Business (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018KYB\u2019) verification processes with the Arbitrum Foundation prior to receiving the service-subsidy.\n\nSubsequently, the designated Multi-sig members, established at the inception of the ADPC and voted in favour of by the ArbitrumDAO, will take charge of disbursing funds to the selected beneficiaries, whereby the transactions will be streamed using Hedgey.\n\nIn recognition of the additional responsibilities undertaken, each of the five multi-sig wallets is proposed to receive a supplementary compensation ranging from 500 ARB - 1,000 ARB monthly.\n\nIt is also important to note, as per the ratified proposal which led to the formation of the ADPC, that the ArbitrumDAO has the authority to claw back funds from the ADPC\u2019s multi-sig wallet using the [<u>Zodiac Governor Module</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability), if necessary.\n\n**Flows of Funds** \u00a0\n\nThe $2.5m worth of ARB will be going to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet (0x40FcE28C9f3a0d7B75B917C95960D61D930dCA54) to be converted to an ideal stablecoin via OTC trading, with the funds then being sent to the ADPC multi-sig as explained above. The flow of funds for the entire program can be understood via the diagram below, as outlined in the [<u>ADPC\u2019s Security Services RFP forum post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031):\n\n<img height=\"467\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXffAEBXfRuoEZxoDAz44sbU5B8dsKbm51vlC1dSWJBxBjHPz3sPkSgaOS29V-qw3dyZ_iWO6RP4qlb97h4NbBR4zSPQB-b0VOqtBm8gBmZOosA0p4bLHy9vwNECpvojQGCCFgKGYCX7NbKT5ycXEvEGxDs?key=p_wBOku1sf7Kgrafe-VzeQ\" />\n\n**Checks & Balances**\n\nKindly note that the subsidy fund will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the [<u>procurement committee proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064), regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:\n\n**Conflict of Interest Provision:** ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members\u2019 involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting:** Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC\u2019s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.\n\n**Duty of Impartiality:** ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal:** ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation & administration of the applicable procurement process.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing:** Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading:** Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets."

    "description": "# AIP-2: Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova\n**Title** \n\nProposal: Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova\n\n**Author** \n\nJason Windawi, Alchemy\n\n**Type** \n\nThis is a Constitutional proposal.\n\n**Abstract** \n\nAs part of the broader development of account abstraction standards and tooling, Ethereum researchers have proposed a new RPC [endpoint](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` that adapts L2 sequencers to the specific needs of ERC-4337 bundlers. Offchain Labs has contributed to this new method by developing, testing and incorporating adjustments necessary to support the endpoint for Arbitrum\u2019s sequencer into Nitro with v.2.0.14, which is now live on the Arbitrum testnet. This AIP proposes that the Arbitrum DAO activate support for this endpoint on the One and Nova mainnets.\n\n**Motivation** \n\n[EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) has created significant momentum for account abstraction across the EVM ecosystem. Among other innovations, the proposal split validation and execution into distinct steps in the process of bundling transactions for submission to an alternative mempool. This split introduced a potential issue for bundlers working on their L2 transactions.The delay between simulated transaction validation by the bundlers, and the final inclusion by sequencers, introduces a risk for reverting bundle submissions. This is due to the lag between the initial submission of a transaction and its ultimate inclusion, during which a smart contract account\u2019s storage can change and invalidate the transaction. Reverted bundle transactions result in lost value for the bundler, discouraging operation of these services until the issue is addressed.\n\nEthereum researchers [developed](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint to address this issue. This endpoint adds new options to the standard eth_sendRawTransaction endpoint that allow users to specify valid ranges for block height and timestamps. This will allow sequencers to reject transactions that don\u2019t meet conditions for inclusion during the earlier validation stage, addressing the risk that in-account storage might change between validation and execution.\n\nOffchain Labs developed, tested and implemented a version of the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint in the v.2.0.14 [update](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.0.14) to Nitro, and have since implemented the endpoint on the Arbitrum testnet. This proposal requests that the DAO approve activating this endpoint for Arbitrum mainnets.\n\n**Rationale** \n\nThis proposal directly supports the DAO\u2019s constitutional value of maintaining alignment with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint was [developed](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) by the Ethereum Foundation to address the proposal\u2019s implications for layer 2 sequencers. Variations of this endpoint are being actively explored and developed by [prominent EVM L2s](https://blog.oplabs.co/erc-4337-and-account-abstraction/) [and others](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/pull/700) in the ecosystem, indicating that the need for this endpoint in the context of sequencer/bundler interactions is a known problem with the need for active work toward a solution.\n\nOur proposal is also aligned with the DAO\u2019s objective of ensuring decisions are sustainable over the medium and long term. As Arbitrum continues to push toward [decentralization](https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/arbitrum-the-next-phase-of-decentralization-e7f8b37b5226) beyond Vitalik\u2019s second [milestone](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), the need for a flexible and secure endpoint for 4337-compliant transactions on Arbitrum will only become more critical.\n\nFinally, the proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community\u2019s values of social and technical inclusion. By enabling one of the core features of account abstraction, Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem would have access to the enormous potential for improvements in UX and other benefits of account abstraction.\n\n**Specifications** \n\nPR # [1474](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1474) on Github provides a history of the development and testing done by Offchain Labs, as well as the multiple stages of review by the team before it was merged on April 11, 2023. Making the endpoint viable for Arbitrum entailed two key adjustments to the checks performed before transactions reach the sequencer. The most fundamental was a config value change to the load balancer. The protocol\u2019s load balancer has historically limited the computational costs of processing transactions by setting the number of acceptable slots in a transaction to zero. The new endpoint\u2019s [design](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) allows for up to 1,000 slots. To accommodate this increase for conditional transactions, PR 1474 removed this 0 restriction for Nitro and for the testnet.\n\nAllowing conditional transactions also introduces a risk of DOS attacks spamming the protocol with transactions regardless of whether they meet the state conditions at the time they were submitted. To address this, Labs updated the Arbitrum sequencer\u2019s pre-check to incorporate a backward-looking validity check of a given account\u2019s state, meaning that transactions can only execute if they met their own conditions as of one second prior to submitting the transaction.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nThe work already done by Offchain Labs on this endpoint means that the steps to implement this AIP reduce to changing the load balancer config value as described above.\n\n**Timeline** \n\nIdeally ASAP, or as soon as is practical for Offchain Labs.\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nThe upfront costs for implementation should effectively be zero given the work done already by Offchain Labs.\n\n"

The reasons for the republication being:\n\n1\\. The former was posted outside the approved calendar window of Thursday 12:00 UTC and we like to avoid ineligibility\n\n2\\. A correction was made on the ARB sum values\n\n3\\. The executable has been simplified to a single tx to avoid any potential execution issues\n\n\n\n# Summary\n\nEvent Horizon is a public good. It is a public-access metagovernance block. With the aim of enfranchising the tens of thousands of small voters, this proposal suggests we delegate (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a non-optimistic 1-year renewal. This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore more incentive to express their voices.&#x20;\n\n\n\nThe Gitcoin DAO has recently passed a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the #6 delegate on Gitcoin.&#x20;\n\nWe also request a grant of 200k ARB to help the team maintain this public good across this 1 year experiment in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket for the Arbitrum community over the past several months. In addition, to ensure community alignment, a separate 125K ARB grant will be paid to the 5 member Oversight Committee in monthly installments. Grant Grand Total: 325K ARB.\n\n# Problem\n\nToday, the typical Arbitrum voter participation rate floats in the low single digits. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ARB doesn\u2019t make sense, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation and surfaces greater cognition from the community.\n\n# Mechanism\n\nArbitrum Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks. As detailed further below, this model:\n\n1. Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low-capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means\n2. Incentivizes participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards\n3. Incentivizes participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain\n\nDAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn\u2019t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.\n\nIn this regard, Event Horizon slots into the Arbitrum ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.\n\nThis serves two functions:\n\n1. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.\n2. It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to participation is a lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who do vote, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who don\u2019t vote to those who do.\n\n**When participation is low\u2026** each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\n**When participation is high\u2026** there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.\n\nImplicit Delegation represents an effort to offer a new paradigm around means of influence. A shift from today\u2019s entirely capital-centric to a more citizen-friendly, participation-centric model.\n\nWhere Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. Because the carrot is governance voice itself, implicit delegation attracts governance-interested citizens, not capital-interested citizens; more on that below.\n\nBecause the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon\u2019s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.\n\n# Rationale\n\n## Delegation rationale\n\n7,000,000 ARB would place the Event Horizon community as around the 15th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.\n\nThis proposal reflects two of Arbitrum\u2019s core mission values:\n\n1. Socially Inclusive: By constructing a dedicated block of governance authority with lower capital barriers, our community greatly expands who gets a seat at the table.\n2. Neutral and Open: By making the thoughts and ideas of this broader swath of individuals heard, we further broaden the spectrum of possibilities for the evolution of our ecosystem.\n\n## Grant rationale\n\n1. While we initially didn\u2019t want to ask for compensation, several delegates pointed out that doing this magnitude of work for the DAO for free sets a bad precedent for future builders. It sends the wrong message of \u201cdo not build here, your work is not valued by the Arbitrum community\u201d. So despite our initial hesitation, and multiple refusals to do so, we now think it important to ask for some compensation.&#x20;\n2. As for the specific grant amount, LTIPP committees members were paid 25k ARB each for 7.5 weeks of work, approximately $50,000 on proposal execution day (February 21, 2024). We\u2019re asking for 200k ARB total (roughly $100k at today\u2019s ARB prices) for the work already done + 1 year of work from the four members of the Event Horizon team and all associated build costs and ongoing maintenance expenses. This is not to depreciate the value of LTIPP committee members, but to draw a humble comparison of the value of our engineering and governance labor both already done and yet to come in this next year. In fact, this pricing (adjusting for price action between LTIPP and now) explicitly values the work of LTIPP committee members at nearly 19x that of the Event Horizon team ($6.7k per LTIPP committee member per week vs. $480 per EH team member per week), not counting the previous year of work that went into building the already functioning product.\n\nWe will also have to pay for a Snapshot subscription which is $6k / year which will come out of the grant. Further labor expenses can be broken down by categories and priced as follows:\n\n1. Launch pass minting on Arbitrum \u2013 40k ARB\n2. Maintain functionality through any changes in Arbitrums governance process \u2013 40k ARB\n3. Maintain and further streamline voter onboarding UX \u2013 40k ARB\n4. Bi-annual reporting including KPIs such as voters, participation rate, voters above key threshold amounts (say $1k worth of ARB), etc. \u2013 40k ARB\n5. Service fee \u2013 40k ARB &#x20;\n\n# Benefits compared to Token Incentivized Governance:\n\nWhile token rewards for participation hold legitimate merit and are an intuitive remedy for low turnout, it has limitations.\n\n1. Misaligned Incentives: Token-based incentives attract returns-interested parties. However, when it comes to governance, participation is most valuable when it comes from those interested in participating not payout. Implicit delegation directly appeals to these individuals as it rewards those who participate, not with capital, but with greater voting power.\n\n*Added Thought Capital: in line with the notion above, there are likely thousands of community members each holding both strong ideas and valuable contributions for the ecosystem, but simply lack enough voice to justify participation. Through Implicit Delegation, any community member of the Arbitrum ecosystem has an opportunity to have their voice heard, bringing thousands more minds and ideas to the surface.*\n\n1. Inflationary: While token rewards drive participation at the expense of inflation, Implicit delegation simply leverages its game theory model to increase incentive to vote in the form of a greater voting share. This does not cost the token any inflation, nor the treasury any ARB.\n2. Non-scalable: Token-based rewards are finite and require a constant drain of ARB funds to continue driving participation. As the ecosystem scales, and more participants join, greater and greater sums of ARB will be needed to continue fueling growth. Implicit delegation has no cost, and its balanced game theory functions with no burn. As more citizen voters join, more Arb could be delegated to the community block, however, again, this is not a cost as the ARB tokens are still retained by the treasury.\n\n# Specification\n\n\n\n## Past Performance\n\nThe above is not just theory. The Event Horizon community is already active on Ethereum providing metagoverning public goods to Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, ShapeShift, and of course, Arbitrum. In fact, in several recent Uniswap votes, the Event Horizon community was the 10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem. Event Horizon has also recently voted as the 8th largest delegate in recent Aave votes. Gitcoin DAO just voted to make Event Horizon the 6th largest delegate in the DAO via delegation.&#x20;\n\nWhile there is still quite a gap between Event Horizon and the larger delegates in the larger DAOs, interestingly enough this position serves as a line of demarcation between individual delegates above, and citizens below. This dynamic does, however, highlight a call to action. Raise the long tail a bit, and bring in more voices. Sure, voting isn\u2019t the full picture of DAO decision making, but it\u2019s a great place to start. Individual, organization AND citizen delegations are all valuable and mutually inclusive, three symbiotic pillars for a strong ecosystem.\n\nSince its inception just a few months ago, the Event Horizon protocol has processed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals and placed over $60,000,000 of governance authority and enfranchisement directly into the hands of the citizen voter, a feat not seen anywhere else in the DAO space. This is $60,000,000 of voice amplification for the low-capital, high-conviction citizen which would never have been possible prior to Event Horizon.&#x20;\n\n\n\nSome more metrics worth highlighting:\n\n**Number of Metagovernance Proposals Passed** ~500\n\nOur community members have participated in and passed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals, each corresponding to Arbitrum or other DAO proposals.\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized per Participating Passholder: >$365,000 (and counting)**\n\nFor the cost of $3 in gas, each participating passholder has mobilized an average of just over $100,000 in Uniswap and AAVE authority governance authority across all metagovernance proposals passed.\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized Multiple: >121,500x (and growing)**\n\nThe average pass holder minted their voter pass for ~$3 in gas. When compared to the $365,000 in average authority mobilized, each member has mobilized over 40,000x their gas cost of admission in blue-chip governance authority.\n\n# Oversight Committee\n\nThe Arbitrum Event Horizon Oversight Committee is a consortium of 5 existing, notable delegates and community members who will assist in the facilitation of this public good. Namely, a simple 3/5 majority would allow this committee to veto the decisions of the voter pool in favor of an \u2018Abstain\u2019 outcome.\n\n\n\nThe five signers of the Oversight Committee are:\n\n1. Michael (Open Zeppelin) 0xBE1d294FD9B71Ae2F6831Eb80777fF73fb73c953\n2. Frisson (Tally): 0xb5D8fe0De11e6a95F1c2D217C55dc4f010EAc7c1\n3. Jordan (Event Horizon): 0x50c28a42AC91F6E6437A036D320c9242432CCE3F\n4. Juanbug (PGov): 0xB8Dcad009E533066F12e408075E10E3a30F1f15A\n5. DisruptionJoe (Arbitrum Delegate): 0x01Cf9fD2efa5Fdf178bd635c3E2adF25B2052712\n\nThe Oversight Committee members will receive a monthly stipend of 2083 ARB per month so as to maintain an ethos of \u201cyour labor is paid\u201d in the Arbitrum ecosystem.&#x20;\n\n\n\n# Implementation\n\n\n\nPer the recommendation of the Arbitrum Foundation, the proposal will forego the Franchiser contract approach in favor of a multi-signature wallet structure. With the passing of this proposal, the DAO will transfer 7.325M ARB to the Oversight Committee multi-signature wallet (0x15C4edF2cF2f36335e42c19E506Ed6cB16a57D8F). The Oversight Committee will then:\n\n\n\n1\\. Send the 325K ARB grant to an Event Horizon SAFE (arb1:0xE67192302E444a8D28F60F6737a8bc7c672b8aC6) prior to delegation. The 200K ARB direct grant will be retained by EH, and the 125K ARB oversight committee payments will be emitted proportionally to all members by EH in monthly bulk txs over the coming 12 months.\n\n2\\. Delegate the remaining 7M ARB to the Arbitrum Community Governance wallet (EventHorizonArbitrum.eth).\n\n\n\nAfter initial delegation, Event Horizon handles all functionality from there. Event Horizon will facilitate and maintain all elements of the pool from pass minting to metagovernance.&#x20;\n\n\n\nShould the DAO wish to recall the delegation, an on-chain vote will no longer be required. Instead, a snapshot proposal will suffice. The Oversight Committee will be beholden to a community Snapshot vote, and will retain the ability to undelegate and return all ARB to the DAO treasury at any point per the request of the DAO.\n\n\n\n*Previous Model for Reference: In order to implement this proposal, it is required that we create a DAO-controlled Franchiser contract. The contract owner would be the DAO timelock and it would allow the DAO the power to delegate and undelegate tokens that it sends from the treasury to the Franchiser. We suggest that the Foundation aids in the creation of this contract in order to create an official and safe implementation, though we can likely fork the Trail of Bits audited Uniswap Labs implementation \\[github] of the same concept. If this proposal passes Snapshot, we request that the Foundation take the time to fork the contract and hire an auditor to check the implementation.*\n\nThe contract has simple functions:\n\n* Fund: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate to a single address\n* FundMany: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate any amount to multiple addresses\n* Recall: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from a single delegate.\n* RecallMany: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from multiple delegates.\n* It is worth noting that all tokens sent to the Franchiser will remain a part of the DAO\u2019s balance sheet as it has full-control over the contract. The delegated tokens never leave the DAO\u2019s ownership.\n\nForking and auditing this franchiser contract would be useful for Arbitrum\u2019s version of retroactive delegation (updated version to be posted shortly). Crucially, we view both this proposal (delegating to EH\u2019s citizen enfranchisement pool) and the above retroactive delegation proposal (boosting active delegates in the 10k-1m ARB range) as two sides of the same coin of the community\u2019s call for creative ways to boost citizen participation and governance decision making processes.\n\n# Additional Considerations\n\nSybil Considerations: it is important to note that the delegated ARB is by a large margin a minority voter amount. Any potential risk of Sybil influence over the public-access block would under almost all conditions not amount to a sum of authority that would be capable of passing a vote absent incredibly significant broader support from other delegates and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem participants. E.g. a rogue vote is virtually impossible.\n\nThat being said, Event Horizon will be implementing Gitcoin Passport requirements for Arbitrum metagovernance.&#x20;"

    "description": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] - Adopt Timeboost + Nova Fee Sweep\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP proposes to combine two separate actions into a single on-chain vote for the ArbitrumDAO to consider: the adoption of Timeboost and a Nova Fee Sweep action. Timeboost introduces a new transaction ordering policy for Arbitrum One and Nova. The Nova Fee Sweep action will forward historical transaction fees to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury, a task leftover from the [<u>Nova Fee Router Proposal</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65).\n\nAs a recap, Timeboost enables auctions for the rights to an express lane on both Arbitrum One and Nova, giving the winner a time advantage for transaction inclusion. Use of bid proceeds from the auction will be at the discretion of the ArbitrumDAO, with the ArbitrumDAO having already signaled strong support for collecting bids in ETH in the [<u>temperature check vote on Snapshot</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xffe9bb38228fdaf3d121140856fd2d51c2ca7f8e0d1021c07e791cebb541129a).\n\nMeanwhile, the Nova Fee Sweep action applies to historical Nova transaction fees currently held in the [<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a); these fees will be swept into the DAO Treasury with the use of the modernized fee collection infrastructure outlined in the [<u>Nova Fee Router Proposal</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65). The full balance of ETH\u2013currently 1,885 ETH\u2013will be transferred to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One using established smart contract infrastructure.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\n## **Timeboost**\n\nArbitrum Chains currently order transactions on a First-Come, First-Served basis (FCFS) basis. The original motivation to implement FCFS was threefold:\n\n1. Easy to understand and implement,\n2. Replicate Web2 user experience for instant transaction confirmation, and\n3. Protect users against front-running.\n\nUnfortunately, relying solely on FCFS transaction ordering is not an ideal long-term solution. This is because when opportunities to profitably arbitrage across exchanges arise on Arbitrum, \u201cMEV Searchers\u201d race to get their transaction included before anyone else so that they can capture this profit. This latency race involves a lot of spam, placing stress on chain infrastructure and causing searchers to wastefully invest off-chain in faster hardware. Furthermore, none of the MEV generated is captured by the chain and instead all profits are collected by searchers.\n\nTimeboost is a new transaction ordering policy that retains many of the great benefits currently in place for Arbitrum chains, including frontrunning protection and fast block times, while allowing the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n\n\n## **Nova Fee Sweep**\n\nHistorically, Nova transaction fees accumulated to the [<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) address, which required a lengthy constitutional proposal process for the ArbitrumDAO to access or spend. The successful passing of the [<u>Nova Fee Router proposal</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) redirected these fees to a system of \"fee routers\" that automatically transfers funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury, reducing quorum requirements, reducing delays, and simplifying accounting by consolidating funds directly in the treasury. As of 28 August 2024, Nova transaction fees began accumulating to a series of RewardDistributor contracts as outlined in the Nova Fee Router proposal, streamlining the revenue collection process for the DAO.\n\nHowever, transaction fees that accumulated to the L1TimelockAlias ***before*** the Nova Fee Router change went into effect remain in the L1TimelockAlias, totalling 1,885.79 ETH. This proposal intends to sweep these historical Nova transaction fees from the legacy L1TimelockAlias address into the new fee collection system. This will be a one-time task because funds collected after 28 August 2024 have been, and will continue to be, automatically forwarded through the new fee collection system to the ArbitrumDAO treasury.\n\n\n\n# **Rationale**\n\n## **Timeboost**\n\n**Sustainable**: Timeboost offers the ArbitrumDAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users, since the value being captured is already being collected by winning latency races on-chain.\n\n**Technically-Inclusive:** Timeboost allows any user to benefit from faster transaction inclusion via an autonomously-run auction that is open to all users.\n\n**Neutral and Open**: The auction for the express lane is permissionless and participation is open to everyone, where the highest bid wins but pays the 2nd highest bid.\n\n**Empowerment:** The ArbitrumDAO can configure all aspects of Timeboost, including enabling or disabling it, the auction\u2019s design, and how to handle proceeds.\n\n\n\n## **Nova Fee Sweep**\n\n**Operations**:**** Collecting historical transaction revenue from Nova enables the DAO to continue funding general operations.\n\n**Transparency**: Transaction fees will be forwarded to the DAO Treasury with the use of verifiable on-chain actions and audited smart contracts.\n\n\n\n# **Key Terms**\n\n## **Timeboost**\n\n* **Auction Contract:** A smart contract that handles the state, accounting of funds for bids, and various operations of the Timeboost auction. The contract is deployed on the target chain for which Timeboost is enabled.\n* **Autonomous auctioneer:** Off chain software that receives bids from Timeboost auction participants, processes and validates bids, and then posts the top valid bid (or top two valid bids in the case of a tie) to the Auction Contract to resolve the Timeboost auction. The autonomous auctioneer, for a given chain, is provisioned & deployed by an entity designated by the chain\u2019s owner.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Express lane:** A separate endpoint for submitting transactions to the sequencer that has priority access compared to normally submitted transactions.\n* **Express lane controller:** An address, defined in the Auction Contract, that is granted the privilege to use the express lane. These privileges are granted after verifying that the incoming transactions were properly signed by the express lane controller, among other checks.\n* **First come, first serve (FCFS):** A type of transaction ordering policy used by the sequencer in Arbitrum chains whereby incoming transactions are sequenced into a block in the order that the transactions arrived.\n* **MEV**: Maximal extractible value. In the context of Timeboost, MEV refers to the maximum amount of profit someone could make by including their transactions slightly faster than anyone else.\n* **Timeboost:** A transaction ordering policy in which entities can bid for the right to access an express lane on the sequencer for faster transaction inclusion. See the[ <u>research specification</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design/tree/main) to learn more.\u00a0\n* **Transaction ordering policy:** The rules and logic employed by a chain to order incoming transactions into a block.\n\n\n\n## **Nova Fee Sweep**\n\n* [**<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>**](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a): address that historically accumulated Nova transaction fees but was replaced by RewardDistributor contracts as a part of the [<u>Nova Fee Router Proposal</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65)[ to upgrade the fee collection infrastructure](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a); historical fees held by this address are the subject of this proposal.\u00a0\n* [**<u>ChildToParentRouter</u>**](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code): smart contract that, when called, creates an L2-to-L1 message which sends the contract\u2019s full ETH balance; once the message is executed, the ETH is transferred to a ParentToChildRouter smart contract on L1\n* [**<u>ParentToChildRouter</u>**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40cd7d713d7ae463f95ce5d342ea6e7f5cf7c999#code): smart contract that, when called, creates a retryable ticket which transfers the contract\u2019s full ETH balance from L1 to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One\n\n\n\n# **Specifications**\n\n## **Timeboost**\n\nThe full specification for the Timeboost auction can be found here: [<u>https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe implementation consists of an auction contract, autonomous auctioneer, and changes to the sequencer:\n\n* **Auction contract** - Prospective bidders must deposit funds into the auction contract before bidding in the auction. The contract is also responsible for verifying bidders\u2019 signatures, checking auction contract account balances, deducting the second-highest bid amount from the account of the highest bidder, and handling the proceeds.\n* **Autonomous auctioneer** - An offchain program that receives bids from participants and resolves the top two bids to the auction contract. This AIP proposes that the current sequencer operator provision and set up the autonomous auctioneer, if Timeboost is adopted.\n* **Sequencer updates** - Changes to the sequencer include: background processes to use the auction contract as the source of truth for the current round\u2019s express lane controller, new business logic to delay non-express lane transactions, and to verify and honor the rights of incoming express lane transactions. Additionally, new endpoints are introduced for the express lane controller to submit their transactions to and for the auctioneer to submit calls to the auction contract for auction resolution.\n\nTimeboost changes the guarantees around transaction inclusion and introduces two different paths:\n\n* **Normal path** - Transactions in the normal path will experience a short delay (defaulted to 200ms), but will otherwise remain unchanged unless the ArbitrumDAO decides to do so.\n* **Express lane** - Transactions in the express lane do not experience any delay.\n\nNearly all users will continue to submit transactions using the normal path. Timeboost introduces an express lane that can be purchased by sophisticated actors via an auction every minute, with each auction closing 15 seconds before the next round begins.\n\nAll bids in the auction are kept private until after the bid submission deadline and the auction winner will pay the same price as the second-highest bid of that round. A bid will only be accepted if it is at or above a minimum bid (the reservePrice). The autonomous auctioneer has the right to change the reservePrice, but it cannot be lower than the minReservePrice, which can only be changed by the ArbitrumDAO. Note, the reservePrice does not represent the expected value of a bid for the express lane, it is just a minimum bid that will be accepted.\n\nThis proposal proposes setting the **minReservePrice** to **0.001 ETH**, as the ArbitrumDAO has already signaled strong support for collecting bids in ETH in the**** [**<u>temperature check vote on Snapshot</u>**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xffe9bb38228fdaf3d121140856fd2d51c2ca7f8e0d1021c07e791cebb541129a).\u00a0 As mentioned above, the ArbitrumDAO has full control over how to spend the proceeds from the Timeboost auction, with 3% of auction proceeds to be set aside for the Arbitrum Developer Guild, which helps fund core Arbitrum development. Governance can change the token used for the auction and the minReservePrice, at any time.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following data sources will eventually made available after Timeboost goes live on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova:\n\n* Historical bid data for auction participants, outside of the two highest bids (that are otherwise posted on-chain)\n\n<!---->\n\n* A way to label/identify which transactions were sequenced in the express lane (i.e. Timeboosted transactions).\n\nFinally, the proposed version of Timeboost is compatible with a centralized sequencer. However, the Timeboost policy will also be compatible with proposals for a decentralized sequencer.\u00a0\n\n\n\n# **Timeboost Implementation Adjustments**\n\n[<u>Timeboost\u2019s design</u>](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design) is the culmination of over a year of research and development by the team at Offchain Labs. While the on-chain implementation will be independently audited by Trail of Bits before the Tally vote, the long term performance of Timeboost can only truly be evaluated with real-world data - data that can help hone and fine-tune Timeboost\u2019s design for the benefit of the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nTo that end, although the auctioneer will function autonomously, **this AIP proposes granting the current sequencer operator the below rights to make the following adjustments from time to time for a period of two (2) years. The rights described below are expected to only be exercised in circumstances where doing so would enhance Timeboost\u2019s long-term stability, preserve or improve the user experience for those using Timeboost-enabled Arbitrum chains, increase the security posture, resiliency, or stability of the chain, and/or otherwise help increase revenue for the ArbitrumDAO:**\n\n* The right to adjust the NonExpressDelayMsec parameter, which is the default delay that non-express lane transactions would be subject to. The default is 200ms, but adjustments could be to any value between 100ms & 500ms, inclusive.\n* The right to change the maxBidsPerSenderInRound parameter, a limit on the number of bids per participant per auction round, to mitigate against active or perceived Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the auctioneer. The starting default will be 5.\n* The right to change the reservePrice to increase the DAO revenue from Timeboost bid proceeds and/or to mitigate the risks of bidders colluding. To start, the reservePrice will simply be the minReservePrice.\n* The ability to rotate the auctioneer\u2019s key for submitting bids and the reserve price setter key for changing reservePrice.\n* The right to pause the acceptance and verification of bids. This is to allow the current sequencer operator to provide reliable, consistent UX and maximize infrastructure stability.\u00a0\n* The right to disable Timeboost entirely in the event of a security risk or otherwise malicious attempt to harm Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova node operators, existing deployed applications, and/or end users. The Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs commits to sharing publicly post-mortems and analyses should this scenario arise.\n\nShould this vote pass, modifications to other Timeboost parameters, including to values outside the specified ranges and to those not already listed above, but which are otherwise listed in the design specification, will require a constitutional governance vote, in accordance with the [<u>ArbitrumDAO Constitution</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution). In cases where the ArbitrumDAO wishes to pause or disable Timeboost, the ArbitrumDAO may use the outcome of a Snapshot vote to do so (since Timeboost has an off-chain component). This special provision allows the ArbitrumDAO to react to market conditions quicker than what a Tally, on-chain vote would allow (~14 days as opposed to ~30 days). The transfer of express lane rights will not be supported by the Arbitrum Nitro node software in the initial launch and may be implemented at a future date via a regular node upgrade. A round's express lane controller, at their choice, can still sign transactions on behalf of others on a per-transaction basis.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, the DAO-elected Arbitrum Security Council can, at any time, perform either Emergency Actions or Non-Emergency Actions to execute software upgrades, perform routine maintenance, and other parameter adjustments to Timeboost, in each case in accordance with its existing powers. These actions can include, but are not limited solely to, exercising the rights proposed above for the current sequencer operator. More information about the Arbitrum Security Council and their scope of powers can be found in the [<u>ArbitrumDAO Constitution</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution).\n\n\n# **Nova Fee Sweep**\n\nThe full script for executing the Nova Fee Sweep can be found here: [<u>Standalone Nova Fee Sweep Proposal #303</u>](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/303)\n\nThis script will be executed following a successful governance vote and transfer Nova transaction fees from the historical [<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) to the [<u>ChildToParentRouter</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code).\n\nOnce transaction fees are received by the ChildToParentRouter, the automated fee collection process will be activated, forwarding fees to the [<u>ParentToChildRouter</u>](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40cd7d713d7ae463f95ce5d342ea6e7f5cf7c999#code) on L1 and eventually to the [<u>DAO Treasury</u>](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58) on Arbitrum One; complete implementation details for this automated fee routing can be found in the [<u>preceding Tally proposal</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616). Please note that Reward Distributor contracts are irrelevant for this particular action as historical fees from the L1TimelockAlias will be transferred directly to the ChildToParentRouter.\n\n\n\n# **Steps to Implement**\n\nThe proposal to have Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova adopt Timeboost was posted to the [<u>governance forum in June 2024</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167), to gather feedback and facilitate productive discussions. Furthermore, a [<u>temperature check vote on Snapshot was passed</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xffe9bb38228fdaf3d121140856fd2d51c2ca7f8e0d1021c07e791cebb541129a) by the ArbitrumDAO, signalling support for Timeboost and the use of ETH to collect bids. Since then, a third-party, independent audit of the Timeboost auction contract was done by Trail of Bits and all issues were addressed (audit report published publicly [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-08-offchainlabs-timeboost-auction-contracts-securityreview.pdf)**).** Finally, Timeboost went live on Arbitrum Sepolia on Feb 12, 2025 where teams have been testing their strategies and infrastructure.&#x20;\n\nSimilarly, the proposed Nova Fee Sweep action will forward historical transaction fees to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury, a task left over from the [<u>Nova Fee Router Proposal</u>](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65). More specifically, this action applies to 1,885.793 ETH worth of historical Nova transaction fees currently held in the [<u>L1TimelockAlias</u>](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a); these fees will be swept into the DAO Treasury with the use of the modernized fee router infrastructure.&#x20;\n\nThis proposal combines both the Timeboost AIP and the Nova Fee Sweep action AIP into a single proposal for an on-chain vote on Tally. If the on-chain vote on Tally passes successfully, Timeboost will be enabled on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova and the Nova Fee Sweep action will be executed. The exact timestamp of the proposed rollout of Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is estimated to be done within 5 business days after the vote gets executed (assuming it passes).\n\n\n# **FAQs and Expectations for Timeboost**\n\nHere is a [<u>compilation of FAQs</u>](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Arbitrum-Centralized-Timeboost-FAQ-bba234acf92e476b8ca5db6855d7da45) based on questions received from the community.\n\nIf there are questions that are not covered in this FAQ document, please add them as a comment to this forum post, and they will be added to the FAQ document accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, a one-pager has been published that recaps a few key principles about Timeboost and summarizes the expectations around Timeboost\u2019s use for chain owners, like the ArbitrumDAO [<u>here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167/106) for delegates to refer to when considering this proposal."
