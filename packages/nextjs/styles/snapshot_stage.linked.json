Interesting model allowing you to leverage + hedge LP through lending markets and like the achievement (points) system to gamify activity. Current levels of adoption is lacking. It's a somewhat large requested grant size which is at par to current TVL to-date on Arbitrum and relative to their activity. Objectives are lofty (boosting TVL to $2.2M - ~24x what it is today on Arbitrum) but could be a worthwhile investment for the DAO to help bootstrap them the protocol. Will receive grant only if they achieve KPIs. For bringing this to the DAO.\"\t\t\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nPrimex provided very little links for the council to verify the data presented, but after looking through their app, we see that\u2019ve begun to get some traction on Arbitrum. The grant ask is a little high relative to their current usage and we would have appreciated more granular details around how they plan to raise their utilization across some of their targeted pools. Overall though we were pleased with their execution strategy and milestones and believe this should move to a DAO vote, given the relatively low ask and current traction starting to increase.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe grant proposal could have been significantly strengthened by identifying a past success, presenting data on the cost effectiveness of that mechanism, and then utilizing the grant funds to scale or replicate that prior success. \n\n*GMX Feedback*\nFirstly, while the requested grant size seems justified based on the outlined incentive program, the objectives and execution strategy lack specificity and clarity. The proposal lacks detailed plans for achieving the stated goals, such as boosting liquidity and increasing trading volume, within the specified timeline. We are not generally supportive of Primex Finance\u2019s application. The DEX space is heavily saturated and it\u2019s not clear to me what exactly Primex brings that\u2019s new to the space.   \n\n*Wintermute Feedback: Conflict of interest*", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "03d14fcc-3d35-4fcd-abff-39a2b65213f0", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x2dafb48842dfd723a3eb40fd5a911cfb7d88c3faa747f642170e64577f0ef3cb", "title": "Socket Bridge STIP Addendum", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2dafb48842dfd723a3eb40fd5a911cfb7d88c3faa747f642170e64577f0ef3cb", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-05-20 20:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "options": {"scores": [13717492.89246555, 70261478.26264302, 52102330.3862002], "choices": ["Approve funding", "Reject funding", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.239", "body": "## Background\n\n**Link to initial STIP application:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/socket-final-stip-round-1/17342  \n\n**Link to Addendum:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-socket-bridge-addendum/23601/3  \n\n**ARB Requested:**\n500,000 ARB\n\n## Reasoning\n\n**Who proposed this challenge:** \nCattin - Seed Latam\n\n**Why this request needs a closer look:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-socket-bridge-addendum/23601/3", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "03e356a7-7069-4d96-b401-3e6683a51717", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x93ba405db28122f4d7c1501bb06f9d606320caee1fb4e73dd1baaf05e8d02c01", "title": "Gamma STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x93ba405db28122f4d7c1501bb06f9d606320caee1fb4e73dd1baaf05e8d02c01", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [173257983.95752355, 3169534.633394472, 3307089.999022022], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.336", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

Since then, the forum has received about 39 proposals covering a variety of topics and motivations. Although most of these discussions have been managed in an orderly manner, an increase in the volume of daily proposals could lead to the disorganization of the DAO and an overload of work for the voters.\n\nThe order and predictability of the dates aim to make the DAO more efficient without losing its dynamism.\n\n## Justification\n\nWe consider it necessary to establish the basic infrastructure for the DAO. Therefore, we propose an improvement in the scheduling of proposals. As time goes on, we are likely to see more and more proposals being published; this growth in proposals is fundamental for Arbitrum's success, so we must be organized so that the flow of voting and proposal is as clear and simple as possible.\n\n## Details of the Proposal\n\nCurrently, the procedure to bring an AIP to a vote is as follows:\n\n![592b3c93c0daa6161427ffa1a5926933e33dfc76.png](ipfs://bafkreiemrsidr37dngxewbijvpe73vfluchh2clj42wagujei7ec45i5lm)\n    \nA proposal can be sent to Snapshot (by an address with a weighted vote of 0.01%) randomly any day of the week.\n\nWe propose that proposals only be sent to Snapshot every Monday so that the votes start at the beginning of the week. The votes for 1 month would look something like this:\n \n![d3ab2463d208946cc43eda4aa933f9f960f29010.png](ipfs://bafkreibt5u65pugwvi4puf5dr7x4xev5jgavo6wi32edemfusrfhrbgf44)\n    \n## Considerations\n\n* More than one proposal can be sent to Snapshot. This depends on the delegates who pass the proposals to vote.\n* This schedule does not interfere with the Security Council voting process.\n* Proposals should be sent to Snapshots every Monday from 00:00 until 23:59.\n* If a proposal is not sent to Snapshot the Monday after its publication, it can still be sent in the following weeks.\n* There may be some Mondays when there are no proposals to publish.\n* In case the Arbitrum Foundation integrates a Governance Facilitator, this should ensure that the schedule is followed.\n\nWe also have to emphasize that given the nature of onchain governance, this proposal isn\u2019t necessarily binding to delegates - since delegates can still push proposals at any moment, so it simply serves as a recommendation for better organizational practices and forum guidelines, making Arbitrum\u2019s governance more predictable for both contributors and voters.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal, if accepted, can be implemented the first Monday after it has been approved since it doesn't really require any technical implementations or funding.\n\n## General Cost\n\nThis AIP does not require funds.", "match_confidence": 0.8864, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "0628acc1-de32-465e-80c3-e2cab78c93a3", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x3860f7700f2e1d6433b013114b0ff95088c09026b39321ca92c8a55fdb33d1e0", "title": "Tally STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0xF4B0556B9B6F53E00A1FDD2b0478Ce841991D8fA", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3860f7700f2e1d6433b013114b0ff95088c09026b39321ca92c8a55fdb33d1e0", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [178820757.2928848, 2299547.659803468, 491036.4331865234], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.43", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

During this period, we will deliver strategic proposals, guide key partners through the DAO processes, and align the priorities of essential stakeholders for the betterment of Arbitrum. We will also expand our efforts to include a small set of additional verticals by hiring skilled contributors in areas where the DAO needs support, such as data analytics, technical proposal creation, marketing, or any other needs that may arise.\n\nWith a budget of $2.47M for the year paid in monthly installments and stored with the Foundation for DAO-clawback capabilities, along with an optional up to 1.5 million ARB for performance-based bonuses voted on by the DAO near the end of the term and put in a 3-year vesting contact to ensure long-term alignment, we will continue to build a dedicated team focused solely on enhancing the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s success. The primary goal of our work is to help Arbitrum DAO continue its path toward efficient and effective operations and execute its long-term vision of becoming a sustainable entity with diversified revenue streams. We believe that over the coming years, Arbitrum DAO has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year while maintaining its status as the leading Ethereum scaling solution with an ever-growing base of users and developers. All of Entropy Advisors\u2019 employees will work full-time towards achieving this goal.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\nArbitrum DAO is set up to prosper with its cutting-edge technology stack that will soon support numerous coding languages, a vibrant community of users and developers, abundant resources in the DAO treasury, and the ecosystem\u2019s commitment to scaling the most decentralized and secure L2 on Ethereum. Despite our belief that Arbitrum holds a strong position in the market today, there is a lot of work to be done over the next 3-5 years to ensure Arbitrum maintains and advances its position. We have diagnosed some key areas in need of improvement that we feel well suited to take on:\n\n1. Designing, drafting and executing proposals that benefit Arbitrum.\n2. Strengthening overall governance processes and providing feedback to other DAO contributors, unlocking efficiencies and ensuring redundant work is avoided.\n3. Acting as a mesh layer between key stakeholders, e.g., active delegates, development teams such as Offchain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n4. Helping potential 3rd party strategic partners navigate the DAO to attract high-quality companies and individuals within the ecosystem and RFP applicant pools.\n5. Attracting/retaining top talent working full-time, professionally on behalf of Arbitrum DAO.\n6. Improving the ability of the DAO to spend money effectively and support a long term sustainable future for Arbitrum.\n\nToday the Arbitrum DAO faces friction executing across all of the aforementioned tasks. Many times those creating proposals have known or unknown ulterior motives and incentives at play. It is difficult for aspiring contributors and partners to navigate the DAO. No one is incentivized to bolster RFP applicant pools. Communication is fragmented with no entity in place to tie perspectives together, and operations/goals often overlap across initiatives. There are numerous proposals that are consensus to move forward but do not progress because there is no financial incentive to do so. There is inadequate accountability over and transparency into DAO funded programs. The problems are ever-evolving and growing, and the Arbitrum DAO needs an entity that only has the DAO\u2019s best interests in mind to fill the gaps.\n\nOur team (@swmartin19, @mattonchain, and @pruitt) brings an extensive network as well as experience in research, governance, brand building, and project management to the Arbitrum DAO, having led well-known brands in the space such as Blockworks Research and 404 DAO. We have all been involved in the DAO since the beginning, starting with Blockworks Research\u2019s entry into the DAO by highlighting flaws in the DAO\u2019s very first proposal, AIP-1. We are not afraid to push against the status quo if we believe it helps Arbitrum achieve its goals.\n\nEntropy Advisors was extremely fortunate to receive a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation. As such, we have been able to use the past few months contributing full-time to Arbitrum DAO to further showcase our value in the community. We have hosted bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls with a cohort of large delegates, with the foundation, and with OCL, and feel that we have a strong hold on various stakeholder\u2019s interests, strategic goals for Arbitrum, working initiatives, etc. When paired with our experience and networks within the industry, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help Arbitrum achieve its long-term goals with all stakeholder perspectives in mind. With exclusivity meaning no official or unofficial engagements with any other client, Entropy Advisors can serve Arbitrum DAO with no ulterior motives or conflicts of interest.\n\nToday, virtually no money is spent on operations, while the DAO has spent almost 435M ARB in total with ~95% going towards investments, incentives, and grants (Source: Delphi & R3gen). We believe it is absolutely imperative for the DAO to make an investment in operations, simultaneously ensuring different initiatives across the ecosystem can be set in motion swiftly, fit together seamlessly, and can reach the best talent, while the DAO\u2019s expenditures can be managed in a way that enables long-term sustainability. It is evident that this is becoming a wider-reaching theme within the DAO, but requires a heavy lift (see OpCo proposal from @dkpremia that asks for 25M ARB). We are NOT looking to replace OpCo, but rather drastically reduce the scope and funding request by helping formulate operational procedures until the OpCo is formally stood up. At that point, the DAO can decide what role Entropy Advisors plays as a service provider to the OpCo.\n\nWith the budget as outlined, Entropy will be able to hire up to 10 employees with a diverse range of skill sets including governance, data analytics, marketing, and development/engineering. We will be able to hire top talent in our industry who will dedicate their full-time bandwidth to Arbitrum DAO. Regardless of Arbitrum\u2019s current strategic priorities, whether cutting costs or scaling strategies, our team will work to execute the goals of the DAO. Given Arbitrum\u2019s dominance, size, and number of initiatives it is important that we build a well-rounded team at Entropy that can operate as the tip of the spear as a catalyst for change across the many sectors that the DAO operates.\n\n## Entropy\u2019s Portfolio\nAt the beginning of May, we introduced Entropy Advisors to the Arbitrum DAO. We are a governance operations-focused business, working exclusively with Arbitrum. Our initial efforts have already driven several notable initiatives, demonstrating our capability and commitment to enhancing the Arbitrum DAO:\n\n![entropy.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiea7v6o66utcod7ynuqcwuoh7ybc53fkmq57tpubeqklzug7q32au)\n    \n* Worked with @r3gen_Finance to create a proposal that reduces DAO OpEx on multi-sig signers, by establishing the Multisig Support Service.\n\n   * We leveraged our network to ensure a competitive applicant pool, which ultimately resulted in one of the most competent applicant rosters (40 in total) in the DAO\u2019s history despite just a $1,500-$2,500 monthly wage per signer.\n\n   * The proposal is expected to save the DAO almost $400,000 per year.\n\n   * Entropy managed the application process, and will soon host a call with the winning applicants to go over multi-sig best practices.\n\n* Conducted research into Arbitrum DAO\u2019s sequencer margin / transaction fee mechanism, kicking off a conversation that aims to increase the DAO\u2019s treasury value rather than deplete it of resources.\n\n   * Attended/helped drive forward discussions related to DAO budgeting and sequencer revenue through working group calls.\n\n   * Followed up with a formal proposal to increase the L2 minimum base fee on Arbitrum One, with plans to establish a more long-term solution that includes service providers.\n\n   * This proposal, if passed, could bring the DAO an extra $5-15M per year of profit.\n\n   * We also tapped on the ARDC to conduct research into these areas, thereby utilizing existing resources at the DAO\u2019s disposal rather than wasting additional resources.\n\n* Moved quickly to get Hack Humanity, the entity behind GovHack, ample funding to throw an event in Brussels at ETH CC for the Arbitrum community. These events require a substantial amount of lead time to plan, and the event would not have been possible if a few extra weeks had passed prior to getting the event funded.\n\n    * This is a great example of Entropy Advisors helping 3rd party service providers navigate the DAO while also combatting the collective inactive problem mentioned above. Everyone wanted Arbitrum DAO representation in Brussels and Entropy stepped in to get it done.\n\n* Introduced a governance calendar that encourages proposals to start and finish Snapshot and Tally voting on the same day each week, requires some support from delegates before proposals move to Snapshot from the Forum, and a holiday break at the turn of the new year.\n\n   *  The goal of this proposal was to reduce delegate fatigue by incorporating a more predictable structure, and ensuring things only go to Snapshot once they have been thoroughly reviewed by the broader community.\n\n***PLEASE NOTE THE REMAINDER OF THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN CUT OF DUE TO CHAR COUNT BUT CAN BE FOUND IN FORUM***", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "08357037-2465-45f2-abcd-ccf42bcda68b", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x7572d14df9604571fa6b58827c7512d94fca09f24541202cd4a976f822df8f54", "title": "Beefy STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0xF4B0556B9B6F53E00A1FDD2b0478Ce841991D8fA", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7572d14df9604571fa6b58827c7512d94fca09f24541202cd4a976f822df8f54", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [58268179.39718296, 38866498.82717116, 26227780.54682117], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.285", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

The proposal aims to create a streamlined & harmonised approach re. service procurement for security-oriented services.\n\n##### **Motivation**\nProcurement Frameworks maintain quality control, ensuring consistency in the services procured. These frameworks also promote transparency and fairness, building trust and adhering to legal standards. Moreover, they aid in risk management, safeguarding against various procurement-related risks, and streamline processes for time-saving and operational efficiency.\n\n##### **Rationale**\nThis procurement framework is designed to ensure that only qualified and reliable security service providers are selected, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of the projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This will aid in ensuring that the security-specific needs of projects building within the Ecosystem are safeguarded to a larger extent & thus serve to safeguard the high standards and reputation of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n##### **Specifications\u00a0& Timeline**\nSpecifications & Timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n###### **Steps to Implement**\nThis AIP will move to a Snapshot vote on the 24th of November 2023. Passing of the Snapshot vote will be deemed as a ratification of the Procurement Framework. There are no associated costs with the implementation of the Procurement Framework.\n\n##### **Overall Cost**\nNo cost for AIP implementation.\n\n---\n\n## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\n- This procurement process is designed to ensure that only the most qualified and reliable security service providers are selected, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of the projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n- Should the ArbitrumDAO vote for the implementation/ratification of this framework, we wil then be proposing the setup of the Procurement Committee that will facilitate & administer this framework.\n- The proposal for the procurement committee will also contain further details on the operational implementations that are to be effected in documenting, record-keeping, and disclosing material in relation to the procurement framework.\n\nThe document outlines a comprehensive procurement framework for the Arbitrum Ecosystem, focusing on sourcing and selecting service providers for blockchain security and related services. It comprises several key components:\n\n- Needs Assessment: Identifying and prioritizing the specific requirements of the Arbitrum Ecosystem, including evaluating the current situation and determining market availability for the required services.\n- Defining Eligibility Criteria: Establishing standards for technical expertise, reputation, tools and techniques, and financial stability that service providers must meet to be considered.\n- Publication of Request for Proposal (RFP): Detailing the scope of work required and the submission guidelines for prospective service providers, along with evaluation criteria and a timeline for the procurement process.\n- Proposal Submission: Requiring service providers to submit comprehensive documentation for evaluation, with submissions made via ArbitrumDAO Forums, allowing community feedback and private collection of sensitive information.\n- Evaluation of Proposals: This includes initial screening for eligibility, in-depth technical and commercial evaluations, reference checks, and possibly interviews, with a focus on transparency and community involvement.\n- Whitelisting, Onboarding & Contracting: Selecting the most suitable service providers, conducting Know-Your-Business processes, facilitating contract negotiations, and finalizing approval of agreements.\n- Ongoing Obligations and Ancillary Matters: Monitoring performance, establishing feedback loops, setting renewal criteria, outlining exit strategies, and ensuring thorough documentation and record-keeping using tools like Airtable for transparency.\n- Public Disclosure: Making key details of the procurement process and the list of whitelisted providers publicly available, respecting confidentiality agreements.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/96d131d75a56e3d72921707f2756d78262307f1a_2_548x411.png)\n\n---\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n[1] On the 3rd of November, DK (Myself) posted a proposal on the Arbitrum DAO Forums aimed at establishing a framework for security-oriented proposals via a consolidated framework ([Consolidate Security Proposals into a RFP Process](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-consolidate-security-proposals-into-a-rfp-process/19328)). By way of a summary, the proposal on the Arbitrum DAO forum discusses establishing a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to consolidate the selection of auditors and security service providers within the Arbitrum ecosystem (for the purposes of this endeavor, we shall be referring to this consolidated framework as the \u2018Procurement Framework).\n\n[2] The Snapshot Vote for the establishment of the aforementioned Procurement Framework has since passed ([Snapshot\u00a01](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1ac6079871dc4af55b7d67eae130e4c1bbcbabd9bb35405bc1733ef2efe45875)).\n\n[3] On the 10th of November, Immutablelawyer posted a public consultation period on the Arbitrum Forums ([Public Consultation re. 'Consolidate Security Proposals into an RFP Process'](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/public-consultation-re-consolidate-security-proposals-into-an-rfp-process/19478)). This contained a base-line framework aimed at giving some context to community members & relevant stakeholders intending on participating in the public consultation. The Public Consultation ended on the 22nd of November 2023. Following calls held, submissions received & several discussions with numerous ecosystem participants, we would now like to present the final procurement framework for ratification via Snapshot.\n\nWe would like to thank all participants who took their time to provide insight in this endeavor. This was a true testament to the collaborative nature of this ecosystem.\n\nCopy of Proposal in Google Docs:\u00a0[Snapshot Proposal Ratification: Procurement Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g1W9BYCNMYWi67E4Zj_TjdtCke321fTL3yhpIuo73HY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n---\n\n## [Procurement Framework for Ratification](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-procurement-framework-security-service-providers/19704#procurement-framework-for-ratification-2)\n\n### **1. \u2018Needs\u2019 Assessment**\n\n- Gather Phase: Collect detailed information on what is needed in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This involves understanding the specific requirements of the end-users, the goals of relevant stakeholders, and any constraints (budgetary, time, legal, regulatory, procedural etc.). This stage often involves interviews, surveys, or group discussions with stakeholders.\n- Analyze Current Situation: Assess the current resources, systems, or services in place. Determine if there are gaps between the current state and the desired state. This analysis should consider whether existing solutions can be upgraded or if new solutions are needed.\n- Define the Scope of the Need: Clearly define what is needed to address the gap identified in the current situation analysis. This definition should be as specific as possible, outlining the functionalities, features, quality standards, quantities, and any other relevant attributes that are relevant.\n- Prioritize Needs: Not all needs have the same level of urgency or importance. Prioritize the needs based on factors like strategic importance, impact on operations, cost-benefit analysis, risk mitigation, and regulatory compliance.\n- Assess Market Availability: Research the market to understand what products or services are available that meet the needs identified above.\n\n### **1.1. Defining Eligibility Criteria**\n\n- Technical Expertise: Prospective Service Providers must demonstrate expertise in blockchain security, including prior experience with smart contracts, the Ethereum network, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum.\n- Reputation: A track record of successful security audits, with references and case studies.\n- Tools and Techniques: Tools for detecting vulnerabilities, including static and dynamic analysis, and formal verification methods.\n- Financial Stability: Proof of financial stability to ensure the longevity and reliability of the service provider.\n\n### **2. Publication of the Request for Proposal (RFP)**\n\n- Scope of Work: Following the conclusion of the \u2018Needs Assessment\u2019 in the Procurement Committee will publish a request for submissions. This will be done via the ArbitrumDAO Forums wherein a detailed description of services required, including security audit scope, frequency, and expected deliverables will be provided by the PC.\n- Submission Guidelines: Clear instructions on how to apply, including formats and submission channels will be provided for prospective applicants so that the approach is harmonized in nature.\n- Evaluation Criteria: Metrics on how prospective service providers [as per \u2018Eligibility Critera\u2019].\n- Timeline: Submission deadlines and timeline for the evaluation process.\n\n### **3. Proposal Submission**\n\n- Documentation: Applicant service providers must submit comprehensive documentation, including company profiles, client testimonials, and detailed descriptions of methodologies.\n- Submissions: Will be effected on a dedicated section of the ArbitrumDAO Forums. This way, the PC can already get a sense of community feedback prior to putting the security service provider through the procurement process. Financial statements will & other ancillary information will not be required to be posted publicly but will be collected through private channels.\n\n### **4. Evaluation of Proposals**\n\n- Initial Screening: Verification of compliance with the minimum eligibility criteria.\n- Technical Evaluation: In-depth review of technical capabilities, methodologies, and tools.\n- Commercial Evaluation: Assessment of cost-effectiveness and value for money.\n- References Check: Verification of the provider\u2019s references and past performance.\n- Interviews: The PC may conduct interviews with the top candidates.\n- Emphasis should be placed on documenting each step of the procurement process and communicating select steps in a consolidated manner to the community for review & input.\n- In this regard, the PC can set up a dedicated notion page wherein the aforementioned details can be inputted, and then linked from the Forum updates posted by the PC.\n\n### **5. Whitelisting, Onboarding & Contracting**\n\n- Selection: The PC will select the most suitable providers to be whitelisted for service-subsidies based on them validly passing the procurement process.\n- The PC will facilitate Know-Your-Business processes so as to make sure that all prospectively whitelisted service providers pass standard KYB checks.\n- Contract Negotiation: The PC will facilitate & administer the process for the finalization of the contractual provisions regulating the engagement between the service provider chosen by the projects & the project itself. Most importantly, the PC has to ensure that the pricing \u2018advertised\u2019 by the service provider for the service requested is consistent with the agreement.\n- Approval: Final agreements will be reviewed and approved by the PC before signing.\n\n#### **Ongoing Obligations of the Procurement Committee & Ancillary Matters**\n\n##### [i]\u00a0_**Performance Monitoring and Review**_\n\n- Regular Audits: Random checks by the PC during the audit process so as to ensure compliance with SLAs.\n- Feedback Loop: A system for feedback from the projects utilizing the subsidized services. This will be pivotal in ensuring that the PC maintains a certain level of quality assurance so as to consistently assess whether any factors that led to the service provider passing the procurement process have changed.\n\n##### [ii]\u00a0_**Renewal and Exit Procedures**_\n\n- Renewal Criteria: Every 4 months, the PC will re-evaluate whitelisted service providers by carrying out an assessment re. The Eligibility Criteria so as to make sure that Service Providers are still eligible.\n- Exit Strategy: If a Service Provider is removed from the whitelist, the PC will publish an announcement outlining the reasons thereof.\n\n##### [iii]\u00a0_**Documentation and Record Keeping**_\n\n- Audit Trail: All stages of the procurement process will be documented and records maintained for accountability and transparency.\n- The PC will be using Airtable to document every stage of the procurement process.\n\n##### [iv]\u00a0_**Public Disclosure**_\n\n- Transparency: Key details of the procurement process and the list of whitelisted providers will be made publicly available, respecting confidentiality agreements.\n\nWe look forward to your final feedback and potentially seeking the framework in action!\n\n#### Voting\nFor: Proceed with this framework, start discussions on PC Leadership\nAgainst: Do not move forward with this framework, it needs revision", "match_confidence": 0.8592, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "0966411c-e207-4d92-9501-989a263c9576", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xd7c38a5af10a30d35b7f63564969097019aeb59e70a48d4364739ef8594f8f6c", "title": "Thales STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x79C4213a328E3B4F1D87b4953C14759399dB25E2", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd7c38a5af10a30d35b7f63564969097019aeb59e70a48d4364739ef8594f8f6c", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [112998989.57551108, 26680448.83319707, 14328778.012212062], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.218", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

That\u2019s what allows for large grants requests. The main weakness of this grant plan was a lack of deliverables promised that can help hold the grantee accountable - there are not explicit targets to hit in terms of traffic or other metrics. All other areas were strong, however. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nAcross has seen impressive usage since its launch and we are excited to bring an incentive program that was successful to Arbitrum. Execution strategy was clearly presented and there was extensive data to backup their plan. As GFX mentioned too, the only weakness in their application was the absence of trackable milestones that targeted hitting their presented KPIs. \n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe team background is solid, with a history of successfully building projects and a deep understanding of incentive mechanisms. They have demonstrated the ability to attract organic traffic and retain users even after the conclusion of incentive programs, indicating a strong grasp of sustainable growth strategies. Their well-thought-out plan for utilizing incentives further strengthens our confidence in their proposal. Additionally, in line with successful grants related to bridging, Across protocol aims to incentivize users to bridge to Arbitrum by covering 95% of the fees associated with the bridging process. This approach recognizes the importance of bridge partners as the entry point for users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Grant Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-d-a-o-grant-program-season-3-official-thread/28753)\n- as member of the [interim council of the GCP (now AGV)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gcp-update-thread/24982/2), with krz, BobRossi, limes, and coinflip\n\nWhile it is not required by the application, I would like to briefly explain the reasoning behind my candidacy.\n\nI have supported AGV since its inception, initially as part of the interim council, and later as a delegate joining regular calls with Dan and Rick. Over the last year, this has meant participating in monthly calls with other stakeholders, as well as individual calls, to better understand the fund\u2019s activities and contribute input on DAO-related matters. To be clear, I do not have access to any privileged information. My involvement has been solely in my capacity as a delegate who has followed AGV since its creation and has broader experience navigating governance. My intention has simply been to help where I can.\n\nMy intention in seeking this position is to have both the bandwidth and the formal role to step up further.\n\n- One goal I have is to better understand, from within, whether AGV\u2019s scope could potentially be expanded over time. This stems from the appetite the DAO and some delegates have expressed for investing across multiple verticals, and it effectively complements AGV\u2019s gradual move toward entertainment and the investments currently in the pipeline. While we are not here to analyse market trends, it is fairly easy to see how gamification, prediction markets and the blending of different entertainment industries are already opening opportunities outside the classic videogame rails while remaining closely tied to them. Composability remains the number one keyword in the crypto industry. Creating AGV, the legal entities, understanding the first-of-its-kind perks and issues as a DAO-born fund, was already a substantial step in that direction as well as a huge lift. Several members of AGV already bring relevant venture experience beyond gaming: Dan and Rick have backgrounds in venture, with Rick serving as managing partner of a studio; council member Tim Chang is as well a venture partner at a fund; and Michael Chang, while strongly focused on gaming, has a long track record in leadership and investment roles. All conditions are here to evaluate if this potential, long-term value-add is realistic or not: an internal understanding of whether additional investment lines could fit within the existing framework.Needless to say, my top priority would remain AGV\u2019s current DAO-approved mandate; I do not intend to shift focus to future endeavours at the expense of ongoing work.\n- My second personal goal is about horizontal communication. AGV as an AAE has grown significantly, both in maturity and in the number of people involved. At the same time, there is still room to improve its integration with other ecosystem entities, as well as its internal communication with the DAO and, over time, with external stakeholders. This is not a criticism of the current council which, in my view, has done an excellent job guiding a first-of-its-kind, DAO-created fund through its initial year.\n- As a final target, I would like to help evaluate how the D.A.O. Gaming Domain could be integrated into the fund. The timing and maturity of this initiative align well with AGV\u2019s mandate. AGV is oriented toward grants and investments in games and infrastructure-related projects, while D.A.O. is focused on user acquisition experiments. While this knowledge is shared since there is a strong communication between AGV, OCL and the D.A.O. team, a full integration could be highly valuable and more efficient.\n\n**Are you involved with any other networks from a governance perspective?

I understand what Arbitrum specifically needs from AGV and how it fits into our broader ecosystem strategy. This provides essential balance to a council otherwise composed primarily of gaming and venture industry professionals who bring critical domain expertise. We need both: strong gaming/venture voices AND strong Arbitrum-aligned voices. My involvement ensures AGV remains focused on its clear role: serving Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem growth.\n\nI\u2019m running to ensure we don\u2019t lose momentum on the work started. AGV remains hopefully the first of many investment/treasury related initiatives (and entities) that we pursue as we take a more economically driven approach to growing the DAO. We shouldn\u2019t keep reinventing the wheel, making the same mistakes and suffering needless delays. As an active delegate, including as we move into a more AAE-driven direction, I have a unique grasp on the DAO\u2019s goals, programs and stakeholders, letting us cut through the noise, help others get things done and unlock the potential of these DAO-controlled businesses to serve the greater vision of Arbitrum.\n\nSimply having done the job before doesn\u2019t guarantee I can do it best going forward. I think people can realistically say they felt frustrated that AGV wasn\u2019t as responsive on a week-by-week or month-by-month basis to the DAO during the first term. That frustration is understandable.\n\nI chose to prioritize my efforts on advocating for building durable governance systems over quick fixes, advocating for foundations rather than expedient solutions that weren\u2019t long-term sustainable or would cause future disputes, even when that meant slower visible public progress. I worked to ensure the DAO would have strong influence on the program without needing to go to extremes, which meant choosing to work quietly on structure rather than publicly.\n\nThe operating team should be able to execute swiftly on their mandate, but oversight rights can\u2019t be traded away for operational convenience. Effective oversight doesn\u2019t mean micromanagement, it means the team can operate with confidence knowing the guardrails are clear and consistently applied. That\u2019s what enables speed sustainably, but building those systems doesn\u2019t happen overnight and work still remains.\n\nThe fact that AGV has clearly turned the corner in recent months reflects both the strong team assembled and the governance foundation that now enables them to operate effectively. That work positions us to move forward with both clarity and speed.\n\n**Next Term Priorities**\n\nTo be clear, what I\u2019m reflecting below is what I hope to encourage fellow council members to also believe in and give clear guidance to the team for improving the program and its impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. It is not the job of oversight to do all such things, but to ensure we can convey to the team what we want and be effective in having that happen.\n\n1. **Building Beyond Single-Term Thinking:** Ensure we have clear systems to successfully manage investments that will extend and be monetized over horizons longer than the currently approved program timeline. AGV\u2019s portfolio will outlive any single council term or program authorization\u2014we need governance structures that handle this reality deliberately, not as an afterthought, regardless of what direction the DAO eventually takes with this program.\n2. **Deeper Integration with the Arbitrum Ecosystem:** With AGV now having clear operational leadership, we have an opportunity for cleaner lines of communication across AAEs and deeper collaboration. OpCo\u2019s recent involvement in administering elections shows how AAEs can support each other operationally. AGV can work more closely with the Arbitrum Foundation on grants to streamline decision making and hand off between potential gaming partners, work to seehow we can make our DeFi infrastructure more accessible to gaming chains, like through OCL-led interoperability efforts, or the Defi network Entropy has been reinforcing.\n3. **Creating Replicable Frameworks:** Ensure that AGV becomes an exportable and replicable framework that makes further investment programs feasible if the DAO decides to pursue them, including any revamps of existing treasury initiatives. We shouldn\u2019t keep reinventing the wheel, the governance structures, operational patterns, and oversight mechanisms we\u2019ve built should serve as blueprints, not one-offs.\n4. **Cultural Alignment, Not Just Structural:** Ensuring that AAEs are aligned with the DAO isn\u2019t just structural: it\u2019s cultural. AGV\u2019s team genuinely wants to serve Arbitrum\u2019s growth and have the DAO\u2019s voice heard in strategic decisions. The challenge in the first term wasn\u2019t lack of willingness, but was lack of established pathways for how to do this effectively and a large learning curve to get the program off the ground. My focus is on fostering these communication channels and decision-making patterns so that alignment happens naturally and consistently, not just when formally required. Building this culture takes time and intentional practice, but the foundation and goodwill are there.\n\n**Are you involved with any other networks from a governance perspective?

The dashboard aims to track voting behavior, safeguard against potential governance attacks, and measure the success of initiatives like Redelegation Week. We are seeking comments and support from the Arbitrum community to develop this analytic dashboard.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum community needs a robust, user-friendly tool to simplify the understanding of complex governance dynamics, track the effectiveness of initiatives, and ensure transparency and accountability. This dashboard will foster inclusive, data-driven decision-making, enhancing community governance effectiveness.\n\n**Differentiation from Existing Solutions:**\n\nOur Arbitrum Governance Analytics Dashboard aims to fill the gaps in existing platforms by providing more detailed metrics for enhanced understanding and transparency:\n\n**1. Concentration of Voting Power Metrics**: Our dashboard sheds light on the distribution of voting power among small and large holders, their engagement in delegation, and the source of delegates\u2019 voting power. It identifies potential centralization of power and offers insights into each delegate\u2019s influence.\n\n**2. Proposal Metrics**: We offer a detailed view of proposal activities, including the ratio of unique proposers to total proposals and the distribution by type. We classify proposal results as contentious, generally accepted, or normal to help stakeholders understand voting dynamics.\n\n**3. Participation Metrics**: Our focus is on delivering granular metrics on the participation of small and large holders. This comprehensive analysis identifies underrepresented groups and informs strategies for more balanced and inclusive participation.\n\nOur dashboard is an analytical tool designed to provide a comprehensive view of Arbitrum\u2019s governance process, highlighting underrepresented holders or delegates and the overall power structure. We are committed to iterative development, refining our dashboard based on community feedback to ensure it remains valuable and relevant for all stakeholders.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values by enhancing transparency, promoting data-driven decision-making, and supporting the effectiveness of governance processes. By providing near real-time monitoring and detailed analytics, the dashboard will help the community make informed decisions and maintain a secure governance framework.\n\n### Example Uses of the Dashboard\n\n1. Redelegation Week Success Tracking\n\nTo ensure the success of the Redelegation Week program, our dashboard will monitor delegate change in their voting power and track the overall votable supply.This user-friendly interface will display the number of delegates joining and the increase in delegations, providing clear insights into the program's success.\n\n2. Optimizing Voting Schedule\n\nOur dashboard will help optimize the voting schedule by identifying periods when delegates are most active. By aligning voting schedules with peak voting activity, we can support the predictability proposal from Entropy, adjusting dates based on these insights to enhance participation and predictability.\n\n3. Safeguarding from Potential Governance Attacks\n\nTo safeguard against potential governance attacks, our dashboard will help monitor unusual delegation behavior, such as sudden changes in delegate voting power into their respective delegate\u2019s voting activity for certain proposals, helping to maintain a secure and robust governance framework.\n\n4. Supporting Tools for Current and Future Delegate Incentive Programs\n\nOur dashboard will complement the auditing of the Delegate Incentive program's results. By providing comprehensive analytics and near real-time delegate participation tracking, it ensures transparency and accountability, allowing for accurate assessment and evaluation of the program's effectiveness.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\n**1. Research & Ideation:**\n\n* We started by identifying the metrics and gather community feedbacks\n\n**2. Design & Mockups:**\n\n* Based on our research, we created initial design mockups focusing on user experience and the presentation of key metrics. These were shared with the community for initial feedback.\n\n**3. Development Phase 1:**\n\n* We developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) featuring basic holder metrics and concentration of voting power metrics. This was released as a mid-development preview to gather community feedback.\n\n**4. Development Phase 2:**\n\n* We integrated additional metrics based on community feedback, including more detailed proposal and participation metrics.\n\n**5. Testing & Iteration:**\n\n* The dashboard underwent multiple rounds of testing for functionality, usability, and data accuracy. We also made iterative improvements based on ongoing community feedback.\n\n**6. Launch & Maintenance:**\n\n* After final testing and refinements, the dashboard was officially launched. We have committed to maintaining it, including daily updates and feature iterations based on community needs.\n\n**7. Monthly Report:**\n\n* Release of monthly governance analytics report\n\n### Timeline\n![image](ipfs://bafybeibv45upfeajnrktntnf4fj6u3j2llfefayksjnqrjlu74gfhw34uq)\n\n## Budget Request (6 months)\n\n### Governance Dashboard (40,000 USD)\n\n* Infrastructure Costs: This includes all the foundational services needed to support the dashboard\u2019s operation.\n\n* Maintenance and Operational Costs: These are ongoing costs required to keep the service up-to-date and running smoothly.\n\n* Data Management Costs: Expenses related to handling and storing the data used by the dashboard.\n\n* Third-Party Services: Costs for services provided by external entities that enhance the functionality of the dashboard.\n\n* Overhead Costs: General administrative and operational expenses not directly tied to specific technical resources.\n\n### Monthly Report (10,000 USD)\n\n* Data Interpretation and Analysis: Simplify complex metrics into clear insights and identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.\n\n* Focus on Key Governance Metrics: Voting patterns, voter performance, proposal outcomes, and voting power shifts.\n\n* Actionable Insights: Provide recommendations for increased participation and governance improvements.\n\n* Customized Content: Tailor reports to community interests and feedback.\n\nExample of our report from SafeDAO: [SafeDAO Governance Analytics Report Thread](https://forum.safe.global/t/safedao-governance-analytics-report-thread/5283)\n\n### Overall Cost\n\n* The total requested budget is **50,000 USD**, with **40,000 USD allocated for the Governance Dashboard and 10,000 USD for the 6 months** of report generation and maintenance.\n(**The amount will be paid denominated in 71,000 ARB (at the current ARB price of $0.70**)\n\n### Team\nCuria Lab: Our team brings extensive expertise in research, data analysis, and experience in DAO and decentralized governance.

There are multiple ways to incentive user activity - completing in-game quests, referrals, daily logins, etc - which we believe will likely bring in new users. While the overall execution strategy is lacking important details for an ask of this size, the other aspects of the application have led us to support this grant. Additionally, we\u2019re under the impression that Beacon does not need a security audit for their NFTs and have therefore not graded them on this aspect. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nThe Beacon\u2019s application scored decently across a range of criteria. They have seen strong success during their demo phase which clearly shows their ability to attract users to Arbitrum and stimulate network activity. The product/industry is appealing to a wide variety of users inside and outside of Arbitrum and if successful creates a competitive advantage for Arbitrum.\n\nThe main concerns we had with this proposal were its lack of ARB distribution details and justification for grant size. They had a general idea of how they intend to distribute rewards but there was no granular breakdown on how much ARB will be allocated to each sub-sections. There is also very little discussion about sybil protections and the protocol has no audit history.\n\nOverall, given the positive points mentioned above, we think the application should be progressed to a DAO vote, however, we urge the DAO to take into consideration the areas of concern highlighted.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe Beacon\u2019s application demonstrates a well-rounded approach, showcasing success and achieving product-market fit in attracting users to Arbitrum. While we seek more details regarding ARB distribution and note the protocol's lack of completed security audits, we are confident in The Beacon's ability to execute effectively, given their strong track record.

It offers a fun incentive mechanism with the prize box. Unfortunately, in a (correct) attempt to mitigate sybil farming of that prize box, it would be restricted to existing accounts. That dramatically narrows the focus of the grant, since it\u2019s no longer able to use its most interesting mechanism to acquire new users for Arbitrum, and instead must make it up with increasing the amount of activity of existing users. In the end, the score was not high enough to recommend approval, but we strongly encourage the applicant to reapply to future grants cycles, particularly if they can find a way to retain sybil resilience and also target new users.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nBebop presented a very thorough well written application. They scored well across most of the rubric; however, their milestone section could\u2019ve been improved greatly to include trackability and focus on increasing activity. Due to the nature of the execution strategy, pairing usage incentives with increased solvers for best execution, as well as their strong justification, fair grant ask, and current traction we will be supporting application. \n\n*GMX Feedback*\nBebop, a DEX aggregator, has a considerable user base on various Layer 2 solutions, positioning them well to attract users from other L2 platforms to Arbitrum with the proposed incentives. Their unique incentive mechanisms, including gasless transactions and mystery box campaigns, add an unique aspect to their proposal. Moreover, Bebop offers easy integration for other projects through their APIs, enhancing composability within the ecosystem. The introduction of their aggregation system, JAM, aims to optimize trades for users, further contributing to their appeal. While the grant size is deemed somewhat high, there's confidence in Bebop's ability to deepen their presence within the Arbitrum ecosystem using the 400k incentives. Although it would have been preferable for them to demonstrate success on Arbitrum with a smaller grant initially, the overall consensus is to approve the proposal, acknowledging its potential to drive volume and engagement within the ecosystem.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR BeBop's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across the rubric. Has demonstrated meaningful adoption across L2s with traction on Arbitrum ready to be scaled. Highly composable with other Arbitrum DeFi protocols. Meaningful target milestones/KPIs to grow volume and that are well justified relative to recent traction on Arbitrum without incentives to highlight ability to scale up from here. While not disqualifying aspects, would have liked to see the following adjusted: (i) slight reduction in grant size (300k); (ii) more detail around the Mystery Box mechanic on proposed allocation of the ARB and mechanics; and (iii) a rebalancing from the ARB Mystery Box allocation to another incentivization mechanic that can encourage new user growth (given the 1-month requirement for account age discourages new users from being able to access 70% of the incentives).", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "0c242748-baf7-4de6-b421-2d8bcdcd5ea9", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x8bea54c2a2443d64e88926977694d973371858dc6a06157a906f5778cf44a106", "title": "DeltaPrime LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8bea54c2a2443d64e88926977694d973371858dc6a06157a906f5778cf44a106", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [77088380.37962765, 28991986.106339097, 26153732.938787527], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.59", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/deltaprime-ltipp-application-draft/21938\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nDeltaPrime\u2019s application was strong and scored will across multiple criteria. They provided detailed explanations of their goals, KPIs, and milestones. Their requested grant size is rather large, however, given their ability to use previous grants effectively and increase TVL on Avalanche reduces some of the concerns.

The large requested grant size relative to their activity on Arbitrum, the set goals of ~6x-ing TVL within a quarter, and lack of clarity on retention (to support their claim of TVL not flowing out of Prime Accounts for instance re: stickiness) brings pause.\n\nSuggest they resubmit in a future grants window with a lower amount (ie. 500k ARB / $50M TVL) after showing more PMF within Arbitrum and integration of other protocols.\n\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nDeltaprime presented a very thorough application. Their organic metrics were quite impressive and the had strong justifications behind their grant ask. We appreciate their ability to incorporate learnings from past incentives and implement desired changes into this program.

The protocol has already demonstrated success on Avalanche and Arbitrum, with a track record of high TVL and user engagement. The proposed grant will further incentivize liquidity provision and borrowing activities, driving TVL growth and deepening liquidity across partner protocols. The use of milestones, speed bonuses, and retention incentives ensures user engagement and stickiness, while the multi-chain integration through the LiFi bridge enhances accessibility and attracts capital from other networks.

By moving to a standardized calendar-year term with elections held during a quieter operational period, this adjustment ensures continuity, minimizes operational disruptions, and lays the groundwork for predictable Council elections moving forward. As communicated in our EOY Transparency Report, January 1, 2025 was the official start date of the AGV program, therefore this shift also serves to align Council terms with AGV\u2019s annual cadence.\n\n## Motivation\nAGV is entering its first full year of execution. This period is resource-intensive and strategically sensitive, involving active capital deployment, milestone tracking, ecosystem coordination, and team expansion. The Council has played a critical role in shaping AGV\u2019s foundation across investment review, grant oversight, and organizational design, and remains central to its success.\n\nTo maintain momentum and avoid mid-cycle transitions, we propose extending the current Council term up to the end of 2025. Additionally, we aim to align all future Council appointments with a single election and onboarding window, providing AGV with the stability and foresight needed to plan around its core business cycle.\n\n## Rationale\nWhen the AGV Council was first elected in late 2024, the goal was to rapidly establish a strong governance structure to oversee the launch of AGV\u2019s investment and grant programs. However, due to departures of previously elected members, our current Council members have varied tenures with AGV due to the staggered nature of our previous round of elections.\n\nNow that AGV is in full execution mode with multiple investments approved, milestone tracking underway, and new deals under review, it is crucial that our core operations remain stable. A staggered or mid-year transition could interrupt that continuity at a time when our Council\u2019s experienced oversight is most needed.\n\nAligning all Council seats into a single, calendar-based term (January through December) simplifies the process for both the AGV operations team and the DAO, while also aligning governance processes with the natural rhythm of AGV\u2019s operations.\n\nUnder this proposal, nominations for the next Council election will open in October, with voting held in November and a structured transition taking place in December, when AGV activity is expected to slow. This avoids governance turnover during peak quarters and provides incoming Council members with the time and context needed to onboard effectively.\n\n## Specifications\n- The current AGV Council term will be extended through December 31, 2025, ensuring continuity during AGV\u2019s first full year of execution.\n- All future Council seats will follow a standard calendar-year term (January 1 \u2013 December 31), replacing any previously staggered elected timeframes.\n- The first unified election cycle will occur in Q4 2025, with an indicative schedule of:\n   - Nominations in October\n   - Voting in November\n   - Transition period in December\n- In the event that a Council member resigns or relinquishes their role before the end of the term:\n   - A replacement will be elected or appointed by the remaining Council members within 1-month.\n   - The appointment must be ratified by the ArbitrumDAO through a Temperature Check vote within 30 days of the selection.\n   - If the appointment is not ratified, the Council will propose a new candidate, and the same selection and ratification process will apply.\n   - The new Council member will serve only the remainder of the current term, ensuring alignment with AGV\u2019s unified governance calendar and avoiding the creation of personalized term lengths.\n   - This structure reinforces predictability, simplifies transitions, and ensures that Council cycles remain anchored to AGV\u2019s business rhythm.\n- This new cadence will remain in effect for subsequent cycles unless otherwise amended through future DAO governance.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n- Extend the existing Council\u2019s term through the end of 2025.\n- Change the call for Nominations kick-off to October instead of July.\n\n## Timeline\n- Proposal submitted: 9th June 2025\n- Planned Snapshot: 19th June 2025\n- If approved, the extension takes effect immediately.\n- Unified election cycle (the timeframe below are for loose reference):\n\n   - October 2025: Nominations open\n   - November 2025: Voting\n   - December 2025: Transition and onboarding\n   - January 2026: New Council term begins\n\n## Overall Cost\nThere is no additional cost associated with this proposal. Governance coordination will be handled within AGV\u2019s existing operational framework.\n\n## EDITS:\n11th June: Added more details on ratification process for replacing a Council member who resigns.", "match_confidence": 0.9375, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "0d3237f4-1e83-4de1-b6c3-7db17fc296b7", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x13bcccfeeb736c732bdd08032841d6a07614d17dcee2d29a435e7b0114361a0a", "title": "[Non-Emergency Action] Fix Fee Oversight ArbOS v20 \u201cAtlas\u201d", "author_name": "0xA7860E99e3ce0752D1ac53b974E309fFf80277C6", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x13bcccfeeb736c732bdd08032841d6a07614d17dcee2d29a435e7b0114361a0a", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-03-05 16:31:56", "voting_end": "2024-03-12 16:31:56", "options": {"scores": [200800130.2320098, 151037.45730578783, 105199.53000231614, 39797.76690599165], "choices": ["Set L1 surplus fee and L2 min.", "Set only L1 surplus fee", "Set only L2 minimum base fee", "Set neither option and cancel"]}, "last_activity": "2024-03-12 16:31:56", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.808", "body": "Request Non-Emergency Security Council Action\nAbstract\nThe transaction fee paid by users is composed of two parts, L2 fees and L1 fees, which together include the execution cost for running the transaction on Arbitrum alongside the cost of posting data to Ethereum (to learn more about this, read the deep dive on the subject 1).\n\nHistorically, the rollup fee market has been dominated by the L1 cost component. With the Dencun upgrade soon being enabled on Ethereum, the current pricing structure may no longer be optimal. The ArbOS Version 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d upgrade is a step towards better consuming the new data availability affordances offered by Ethereum, but will also potentially require further adjustment once EIP-4844 has been deployed and tested.\n\nThere was an oversight during the ArbOS Version 20 \u201cAtlas\u201d upgrade where two configuration should be updated for users when the Dencun upgrade occurs:\n\nL1 surplus fee. Reduce the surplus fee per byte from 32 gwei to 0.\nL2 base fee. Reduce the minimum from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei.\nIn both cases, the configuration changes will match what is currently implemented in Arbitrum Nova. As evidenced by the recent surge of transactions in Arbitrum Nova, the network can handle the increased transaction throughput while offering lower fees for users in general under that configuration.\n\nImpact on the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s revenue\nThe L2 base fee change will impact the revenue received by the ArbitrumDAO. The potential impact based on the past 30 days of activity was calculated, which if the changes had been implemented (ignoring potential changes in demand based on lower fees), would have resulted in overall profit going from 816.13 ETH \u2192 79.89 ETH\n\nWhile the fee reduction will result in lower revenue for the ArbitrumDAO in the short term, it will ensure that the Arbitrum One network continues to offer competitive costs to its users and in turn it can lead to an increase in transaction traffic.\n\nSince the parameter change affects the revenue generated, it is important to carry out a temperature check for the ArbitrumDAO to discuss and ultimately vote on the change.

If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD does not pass - then the Arbitrum Foundation will return these funds, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD only proposes the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet introduce an economic incentive mechanism to grow the validator set (since Arbitrum only needs 1 honest, active proposer at any point in time). Without this incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. In order to become an active proposer for Arbitrum One, post-BoLD, a validator has to propose an L2 state assertion to Ethereum. If they do not have an active bond on L1, they then need to attach a bond to their assertion in order to successfully post the assertion. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice\u2019s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded. There can only be 1 \u201cactive\u201d proposer at any point.\n- **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.\n- **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n- **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n- **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n- **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer *must* have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n- **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer once their assertion is confirmed. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n## Budget Request\n\n### Assertion and Challenge Bonds\n\nThe Foundation is requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.\n\nThe requested ETH is a combination of:\n- 3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;\n- Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the [RollupCore.sol] contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\nNote: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active proposer, not the ONLY proposer. BoLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators who are eligible to be proposers, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run validators to become proposers for Arbitrum One upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.\n\n## Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate.\n2. Temperature checks on Snapshot.\n  a. Bond sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BoLD validator.\n  b. Operational cost sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer, totalling 900 ETH.\n3. Depending on the temperature check result:\n  a. Continue to Tally. If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.\n  b. Re-iterate on numbers. If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until there is consensus.\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD is passed.\n\n## Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n- 3600 ETH to run the first BoLD-enabled proposer for Arbitrum One, and\n- 634 (555 + 79) ETH budget to counter one BoLD challenge.\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury by revoking the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s proposer at any time and returning the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n- **Withdrawal Address**. The funds will be deposited into BoLD from the Arbitrum Foundation-controlled multi-sig address but the withdrawal address will be set to the \u2018UpgradeExecutor\u2019 contract on L1.\n- **Triggering Withdrawal**. The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s treasury).", "match_confidence": 0.8421, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "120eb03c-9f4b-4ca5-8d12-4529ba57278b", "proposal_id": "92122494-8acf-4be9-9ab7-8799ea1bcb80", "snapshot_id": "0xb0156cfc112bbe4275b0a1d6cacc3970affdad6057047b8cee79ba54d45446aa", "title": "Proposal: Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova", "author_name": "0xdb5781a835b60110298fF7205D8ef9678Ff1f800", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb0156cfc112bbe4275b0a1d6cacc3970affdad6057047b8cee79ba54d45446aa", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-06-20 00:21:00", "voting_end": "2023-06-27 00:21:00", "options": {"scores": [60523829.13279885, 105311.60145292307, 78643.78040694348], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-06-27 00:21:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.854", "body": "Author\nJason Windawi, Alchemy\n\nType\nThis is a Constitutional proposal.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of the broader development of account abstraction standards and tooling, Ethereum researchers have proposed a new RPC endpoint eth_sendRawTransactionConditional that adapts L2 sequencers to the specific needs of ERC-4337 bundlers. Offchain Labs has contributed to this new method by developing, testing and incorporating adjustments necessary to support the endpoint for Arbitrum\u2019s sequencer into Nitro with v.2.0.14, which is now live on the Arbitrum testnet. This AIP proposes that the Arbitrum DAO activate support for this endpoint on the One and Nova mainnets.\n\nMotivation\nEIP-4337 has created significant momentum for account abstraction across the EVM ecosystem. Among other innovations, the proposal split validation and execution into distinct steps in the process of bundling transactions for submission to an alternative mempool. This split introduced a potential issue for bundlers working on their L2 transactions. The delay between simulated transaction validation by the bundlers, and the final inclusion by sequencers, introduces a risk for reverting bundle submissions. This is due to the lag between the initial submission of a transaction and its ultimate inclusion, during which a smart contract account\u2019s storage can change and invalidate the transaction. Reverted bundle transactions result in lost value for the bundler, discouraging operation of these services until the issue is addressed.\n\nEthereum researchers developed the eth_sendRawTransactionConditional endpoint to address this issue. This endpoint adds new options to the standard eth_sendRawTransaction endpoint that allow users to specify valid ranges for block height and timestamps. This will allow sequencers to reject transactions that don\u2019t meet conditions for inclusion during the earlier validation stage, addressing the risk that in-account storage might change between validation and execution.\n\nOffchain Labs developed, tested and implemented a version of the eth_sendRawTransactionConditional endpoint in the v.2.0.14 update to Nitro, and have since implemented the endpoint on the Arbitrum testnet. This proposal requests that the DAO approve activating this endpoint for Arbitrum mainnets.\n\nRationale\nThis proposal directly supports the DAO\u2019s constitutional value of maintaining alignment with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The eth_sendRawTransactionConditional endpoint was developed by the Ethereum Foundation to address the proposal\u2019s implications for layer 2 sequencers. Variations of this endpoint are being actively explored and developed by prominent EVM L2s and others in the ecosystem, indicating that the need for this endpoint in the context of sequencer/bundler interactions is a known problem with the need for active work toward a solution.\n\nOur proposal is also aligned with the DAO\u2019s objective of ensuring decisions are sustainable over the medium and long term. As Arbitrum continues to push toward decentralization beyond Vitalik\u2019s second milestone, the need for a flexible and secure endpoint for 4337-compliant transactions on Arbitrum will only become more critical.\n\nFinally, the proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community\u2019s values of social and technical inclusion. By enabling one of the core features of account abstraction, Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem would have access to the enormous potential for improvements in UX and other benefits of account abstraction.\n\nSpecifications\nPR # 1474 on Github provides a history of the development and testing done by Offchain Labs, as well as the multiple stages of review by the team before it was merged on April 11, 2023. Making the endpoint viable for Arbitrum entailed two key adjustments to the checks performed before transactions reach the sequencer. The most fundamental was a config value change to the load balancer. The protocol\u2019s load balancer has historically limited the computational costs of processing transactions by setting the number of acceptable slots in a transaction to zero. The new endpoint\u2019s design allows for up to 1,000 slots.

The goal of the STEP program is treasury diversification along with ecosystem growth for Real World Asset (RWA) protocols on Arbitrum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal kickstarts the second edition of the Stable Treasury Endowment Program, which aims to grow the RWA ecosystem (many of the top protocols do not need grants so much as AUM for their product) while simultaneously diversifying our treasury into stable, liquid and yield-generating assets (the volatility of the ARB token has highlighted the need for prudent diversification).\n\nThe RWA sector is growing at leaps and bounds with much room to grow even further considering the US treasury market by itself is $20 trillion. Arbitrum has [grown](https://x.com/EntropyAdvisors/status/1869053544164380848) from only $100k of RWAs in the beginning of 2024 to around [$150 million](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-rwa-case-study) today! Only 18% of this volume has come from the DAO itself through STEP 1, with the remaining TVL growing via organic means. To stay on top of this competitive sector, we need reliability and consistency in the programs we run for this vertical.\n\nAt the same time, we have seen increasing interest in treasury diversification initiatives across Arbitrum DAO. STEP follows 3 clear principles in dealing with service providers proposing to help with Arbitrum treasury diversification;\n\n* Directly own the process of selecting stable assets providing yield rather than delegating to a treasury manager (no point paying 1% AUM for them to hold low-risk assets on our behalf).\n\nThe STEP program is an example of how this can take place: an RFP under which projects apply with their product; a committee to review applicants; a program manager to monitor selected products\n\n* Diversify the treasury in a manner that also promotes ecosystem growth, by conducting a highly competitive and rigorous  process where the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO selecting a provider is as valuable as the business they get\n\nAccordingly, have projects directly apply in a competitive process on our forum if they want us to diversify into their product and be ratified in some way through a vote, not privately approach a treasury manager to get included\n\n* Take advantage of rising markets to steadily build up an endowment that can cover ARB DAO expenses from yield earned. \n\nPassage of this proposal will bring our endowment near the $100 million mark: $30 million from STEP 1, ~$15-25 million from the [treasury management initiative](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/111105159609719390908725919603971316574753860587890014819515615630412225940809?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) and now STEP 2\n\n# Rationale\n\nIn mid-2024, Arbitrum DAO [diversified](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-committee-recommendations/25097/36) $30 million into stable, liquid & yield generating RWAs. A comprehensive RFP process was undertake, where the DAO received 33 applications from RWA issuers, of which 16 were shortlisted and 6 were finally selected for allocations: Securitize BUIDL ($9.57 million), Ondo USDY ($5.22 million), Superstate USTB ($5.22 million), Mountain USDM ($3.48 million), OpenEden TBill ($3.48 million), and Backed Finance bIB01 ($3.48 million). These allocations helped us diversify the treasury into dollar denominated assets, got selected providers to launch on Arbitrum and are expected to generate a yield of roughly $875k for our treasury (live dashboard to track yield [here](https://dune.com/steakhouse/step-dashboard))\n\nThe 1st program narrowly targeted low-risk and liquid instruments (primarily US treasury bills and money market instruments). STEP 2 will have a similar scope of products. We explored other markets but see biggest benefit in Arbitrum doubling down on the same instruments as STEP 1 and exploring other RWA sectors after they have had time to mature. After all, 99% of RWAs on Arbitrum are still U.S. Treasuries\n\nOverall, this proposal aims to achieve 3 broad objectives;\n\n\n* Show that Arbitrum has a plan for the RWA vertical and projects in this sector should build on our chain, by building a regular cadence to the STEP program as the flagship program for RWA support\n\n\n* Let the DAO directly own stable RWAs through a competitive selection process for providers, instead of paying 1% AUM to treasury managers for selecting and holding low risk assets on our behalf. Use yield from the products to cover operational expenses by sweeping it as USDC to the ARB DAO treasury.\n\n\n* Provision funds ahead of time for optimal execution and take advantage of tailwinds when they arise for diversifying the treasury. Building up an endowment will let us weather even bear markets from an abundance mindset.\n\n\n# Specifications\n\n\n* We will transfer 35 million ARB to the same foundation managed wallet (0xe41d54471EfA03eFF6365795f60545F3cAF7C97e) used in the initial STEP program\n\n\n* The foundation will at their discretion liquidate the ARB and once complete, announce the average conversion price on the forum\n\n\n* Service providers who applied in STEP 1 will have to simply communicate what has changed in their product. Ample feedback was provided to all applicants, so if they have not managed to address the concerns we do not need to re-review applicants. New applications will be reviewed fresh. The RFP will be similar as STEP 1 with some modifications that will be included in the tally vote.\n\n\n* The committee may at their discretion review investments made in STEP 1 and propose re-allocations from providers selected in the earlier edition. High preference will be given to providers that already have their RWA product launched on Arbitrum.\n\n\n* The selection committee will be same as last time with one major change: Entropy will replace Steakhouse Financial who will not be a voting member due to also being the STEP program manager.\n\n\nSo the committee will be composed of @GFXlabs , @northlakeslegal , @Nethermind , @Entropy and @karpatkey , with the Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability Group led by myself as non-voting facilitating member (except in case of tie) to communicate with service providers, the DAO and the foundation.\n\n\n* Funds are allocated to selected providers after ratification by the DAO\n\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n\n* A snapshot vote approving in principle a STEP 2 for first half of 2025\n* A tally vote with the RFP service providers can apply under that authorizes transfer of funds from the treasury to the Foundation STEP multisig\n* Call for applications from service providers\n* Committee review of applications\n* DAO approval of committee recommendations\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\nForum Discussion: September-December\nJanuary: Snapshot vote\nFebruary: Tally vote completion\nMarch: Call for Applications\nApril: Committee Review\nMay: DAO Ratification\n\n\n# Overall Cost\n\n\nDiversification budget: 35 million ARB, same as STEP 1\nImplementation budget: 125k ARB\n\n\nSimilar to STEP 1, a rate of 25k ARB x 5 committee members (GFX, Northlake, Nethermind, Karpatkey and Arbitrum T&S WG as facilitating member; Entropy to waive compensation) \n\n\n10k ARB will be given upon completion of work and the remaining 15k ARB will be vested over 3 years although it can be delegated for voting power.\n\n\nRough budget estimates\n50 applications\n2 hours for 25 applications with few updates.\n6 hours for remaining 25 new products/drastic changes.\nTotal: 200 hours.\nAnother 20 or so hours for all the deliberation, selections, allocation decisions we have within the committee.\nAverage rate of $100-$150/hr would be between 25-33K, downsized to 25k ARB (10k on completion and 15k over 3 years)\n\nSTEP has developed a reputation of having a ton of due diligence. We think this is a good flag to hold high, since the benefits from being a STEP recipient go beyond just the amounts we allocate to also the legitimacy of passing heavy scrutiny by our committee. Service providers have also expressed appreciation on the feedback they got on their product, which in many cases led to different design decisions by their team.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "133e9be9-b249-4fdc-a519-952e05c4605a", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x76ff3c3e1750cfbe34dd62ed22c0c126168963d6acce2217acc4bcc7e9e623b7", "title": "UniDex STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x79C4213a328E3B4F1D87b4953C14759399dB25E2", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x76ff3c3e1750cfbe34dd62ed22c0c126168963d6acce2217acc4bcc7e9e623b7", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [4353455.173410655, 59018238.15487949, 59151232.47205204], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.171", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

Allowing tokens to be bridged back and forth is key to this.\n\n# Specifications\n\n$BORING on Ethereum is a simple, non-upgradable ERC20 contract, deployed to 0x0Bc4dF77353ae96f31bC82bC2536bb23B2009919.\n\n$BORING on Arbitrum is a Super Token - essentially an ERC20 token with advanced capabilities like streaming and scalable distribution. It\u2019s deployed by the same deployer account, to the same address: 0x0Bc4dF77353ae96f31bC82bC2536bb23B2009919 .\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nAccording to the Arbitrum bridge docs, bridging to an Arbitrum token with custom logic requires registration in the Arbitrum generic-custom gateway, which can be done either by the L1 token contract itself or by the Arbitrum DAO. Since the L1 token contract was deployed in the past without knowing this requirement, and is not upgradable, the latter option is needed.\n\n# Timeline\n\nSuperboring on Arbitrum is expected to go live in a couple of weeks.\n$BORING availability is not blocking, but would help make this deployment more attractive.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nWe assume the process of token registration to be well known and thus incur no or negligible cost for the DAO.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "14e5083d-23c9-48c7-b3df-49dc3050ca06", "proposal_id": "368aed1b-6c46-4fda-85f0-e511557ccae7", "snapshot_id": "0xf922eb584e616475100222fba40b0d6574ffc113bbb5b92b76e40bb2a91e45dc", "title": "Hackathon Continuation Program", "author_name": "0x13BDaE8c5F0fC40231F0E6A4ad70196F59138548", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf922eb584e616475100222fba40b0d6574ffc113bbb5b92b76e40bb2a91e45dc", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-11-22 23:54:46", "voting_end": "2024-11-29 23:54:46", "options": {"scores": [29153935.446062993, 76299517.26397929, 22362935.307547662, 18492523.68828074], "choices": ["In favour, yes onchain mechanism", "In favour, no onchain mechanism", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-11-29 23:54:46", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.908", "body": "Text shortened due to character limit. Please review forum for full proposal.\n\n\n# 1. Introduction\nA few months ago, Arbitrum funded the Arbitrum CollabTech Hackathon through Questbook. This month-long event has just ended, having gathered great talent and energy.\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve got\n- 164 applications and 144 participants\n- 20 projects submitted\n- 15 finalist projects built on Arbitrum.\n- 3 winners having built a narrowly focused PoCs\n\n\nWe\u2019ve created a funnel for builders on Arbitrum and we want to sustain this momentum. However, without support, the teams will soon seek opportunities elsewhere. Questbook new protocols track is out of funding but, even if it had funding, the projects need not only capital but also network access and expertise.\n\n\n\n\nRnDAO proposes to co-fund (roughly 50-50) a program in partnership with Arbitrum to invest in and support these teams.\n\n\n\n\nThis program is designed to take projects from a hackathon PoC to engage in systematic customer validation, iterate and develop an MVP, and get their first 100 users. As such, we\u2019re leveraging the raw talent and expecting the projects to evolve significantly as they engage and validate with customers, achieving traction at the end of the program.\n\n\n\n\n# 2. The Solution: Turn Hackathon talent into Long-Term Success\nEarly-stage projects often stall or fail because they lack a deep understanding of their target audience and its needs. Systematic customer validation can significantly increase the likelihood of projects thriving beyond this initial stage.\n\n\n\n\nThis initiative, co-funded by RnDAO and Arbitrum, aims to build an ecosystem of unique Arbitrum-based projects that will continue to grow and attract new projects.\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve designed a 6-month, two-phase program to capture the best of the hackathon talent and energy.\n\n\n\n\nPhase 1 focuses on validating ideas (customer development, lean startup, and design thinking methods) and understanding the market landscape.\nPhase 2 supports projects to move from PoC to the development of a market-viable MVP and securing the first 100 users.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how:\nWe will select the 4 most promising hackathon teams to join the program (through due diligence by the RnDAO investment committee).\nEach project will receive an initial grant (2k per cofounder per month, max 12k) from Arbitrum to support their participation in Phase 1.\nUpon successful completion of user research, validation of interest, and presentation of a viable business case (solid pitch deck), the top 2 projects can move to Phase 2.\nPhase 2 projects are awarded an additional $38k from Arbitrum and receive hands-on support (sales strategy, biz dev, marketing amplification, intros to funders, team formation, setting up ops processes and legal, setting up agile product development processes, etc.).\nGoals:\n\n\n\n\nshort-term (6 months): projects validate their concepts with customers (first 100 users) and generate traction to fundraise from investors or otherwise receive follow-on funding or generate revenue.\nlong-term: create a group of unique ventures that collaborate and integrate (business cluster), drawing in new projects like a magnet with less direct involvement from our team.\n\n\n# 3. Proposed Support Program\n\n\n**Program Structure (Two Phases)**\nBy breaking funding and mentorship into two distinct phases, we derisk capital allocation. Only projects that successfully validate customer demand and can showcase a market gap in the first phase will advance to the second phase, ensuring that resources are focused on ventures with proven potential.\n\n\n**Phase 1: Customer Validation (3 Months)**\nFunding: Each project receives $2,000 per month per cofounder (max 2 cofounders receiving funding per project), totalling $12,000 per project for Phase 1.\nGoal: Support validation with real users to confirm demand and solidify the project\u2019s foundation.\nProcess: Most hackathon projects lack any customer validation and have a shallow understanding of the problem. As such, they fail to gain traction and die. In Phase 1 we focus on addressing these issues head-on by guiding projects through a structured customer validation process, with\nweekly strategy and customer development mentoring sessions\nshadowing user research calls and providing feedback\nmultiple hours of hands-on support per week (up to 8 hours per week directly with each project and extra cohort work) to refine their outreach campaigns (tactical support on copy, messaging, refining target user groups, introductions, implementing automation tools, etc.) and support on making the competitive landscape.\n\n\n**Transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2:**\nAssessment by RnDAO investment committee (we\u2019ll invest significant labour in the next phase and so will only approve teams we deem viable).\nAssessment based on market viability (clearly understood customer problem, market gap, proposed solution based on customer insights, viable team).\n\n\n**Phase 2: Development and Scaling (3 Months)**\nFunding: Projects that successfully complete Phase 1 will receive an additional grant of $38,000 each, amounting to a total of $50,000 per venture across both phases (enough to build and market test a basic MVP plus 3 months runway for market testing and securing the next bit of funding).\nGoal: This phase supports full product development, go-to-market strategy, and readiness for sustainable operation, whether through fundraising, revenue, or further grants.\nProcess: After initial customer validation, the key challenge for founders is being spread too thin, while needing to set up an effective, agile product development process to quickly validate hypotheses and accelerate product-market-fit, ensure financial sustainability (pitch development and fundraising), set up a fully functioning team (talent recruitment), and operate the organisation (admin and ops). We\u2019ll help teams with all of these challenges, operating as a fractional c-suite (down in the trenches with them, up to 10 hours per week with each project and extra cohort work) and fast-track their brand recognition and network with the support of our marketing team.\n\n\n\n\n## RnDAO Program\u2019s Value and advantages over regular incubation programs\nSwarm Collaboration: participants join an alliance of similar projects, encouraging integrations (good for project retention in Arbitrum), sharing best practices, co-marketing, cross-selling, and more. RnDAO facilitates this through a system of guilds, collaborative databases, cross-ownerhsip, and facilitating specific collaborations.\nNot just advisory, hands-on operators: we get our hands dirty working directly in the projects, fast-tracking their development.\nNetwork access:\nSupport in establishing customer relationships by leveraging the RnDAO vertically-specialized network and peers\u2019 networks.\nAssistance in securing additional funding and achieving self-sustainability.\nTalent network and talent attraction support via RnDAO community and comms channels.\nEnhanced Visibility:\nIncreased attention from investors and customers through the RnDAO brand umbrella and marketing initiatives.\nCombined, these strategies enable us to provide high-quality and hands-on support, customer access, market insights, and talent access, resulting in faster time to market and reduced failure rate for projects.\n\n\n\n\nMore on Swarm methodology and data-backed comparison with other types of programs: https://www.rndao.io/blog/post/startups-from-solo-to-multiplayer-from-ad-hoc-to-systematic\n\n\n\n\nOverview of support offered: \u200b\u200b\nhttps://docsend.com/view/jys5wqqg9vi8qknm\n\n\nProgram Outcome:\nIn six months, we aim for at least 2 of the projects to:\n- Get their first 100 users.\n- generate revenue (early validation), and/or\n- secure additional grants or successfully fundraise to continue growing.\n\n\nMedium term (2 years) the investment should achieve 25% IRR (unrealised)\n\n\n# 4. Anchoring in Abritrum through early onchain activity\nTo incentivise retention of the projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem, generate early onchain activity, and provide opportunities for project contributors to gain ownership in the projects, the program will support projects in implementing an onchain system to track contributions with points (non-transferable ERC-20s).\n\n\n\n\nThe methodology is based on sweat equity and leverages CollabBerry.xyz (project incubated in the Arbitrum Co.Lab Fellowship and later funded by Arbitrum\u2019s Questbook program to develop an MVP).\n\n\n\n\n# 5. Implementation Plan - Budget\nThe budget is divided in 4 categories:\n\n\n\n\nCapital Investment into the projects: direct capital allocation to the teams.\nVenture Support: hands-on support and mentorship given to the projects.\nEarly onchain functionality (CollabBerry grant)\nProgram Ops & Comms: creation of monthly program reports to the DAO & delegates stakeholder management, amplification and marketing support for projects (including recruitment/team matchmaking support and marketing strategy workshop), program branding and promotion of Arbitrum as a great home for builders, program management and overhead, and incentives for interview participants in phase 1.\n\n\n\n\nTotal Program Cost: $416,530\nArbitrum Budget Contribution: $213,780\n- Capital Investment into projects $124k\n- Early onchain functionality $30k\n- Program Ops & Comms $60,780k\nRnDAO Budget Contribution: $206,250\n- Venture Support: $180k\n- Program Ops & Comms $26,250\n\n\n\n\n# 6. Funds Management & Payment Schedule\nThe funds provided by ArbitrumDAO will be transferred to the Arbitrum MSS.\n\n\nThe funds are then transferred in two phases and to three separate groups for easy auditing\n\n\nRnDAO multisig for Capital deployment into projects\nRnDAO multisig for Program Ops & Comms\nCollabBerry multisig (Early onchain functionality)\n\n\n\n\nPhase 1: $103,000\nCapital deployment into projects $48k\nProgram Ops & Comms $35k\nEarly onchain functionality $20k\nPhase 2 (upon completion of Phase 1): $111,780\n\n\n\n\nCapital deployment into projects $76k\nProgram Ops & Comms $25,780\nEarly onchain functionality $10k", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "15349145-ec96-4aa9-afe3-220250cf2b49", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x6c4a78cb00f613cdfe49e47c17cb83e74776873a789ea2553c0b1014b0288ae1", "title": "HMX STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0xF4B0556B9B6F53E00A1FDD2b0478Ce841991D8fA", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x6c4a78cb00f613cdfe49e47c17cb83e74776873a789ea2553c0b1014b0288ae1", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [2474234.0091958577, 34730696.884089895, 79561346.50266898], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.331", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

Their Arbitrum traction is lacking for their age, however, they have decent TVL across other chains.\nTheir application also mentioned that they would be using a portion of rewards to incentivize the yield of their native token without little justification. Their native token already benefits from protocol revenue that will be generated from other ARB rewards/activity on the platform. The iFARM vault at the time of marking has not been deployed on Arbitrum, however, the team has mentioned that they are in the process of deploying it.\nWe would\u2019ve also liked to have seen more of an emphasis on incentivizing current users from other chains to Arbitrum.\nGiven the composability of the project and the fact that rewards will ultimately benefit other protocols, we will supporting this application so that the DAO can make the final decision.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nHarvest Finance presented a solid proposal overall and we appreciated their collaborations with multiple other protocols which could lead to the grant having strong secondary effects.

Harvest's commitment to diversifying strategies, incentivizing partner vaults, and driving user adoption aligns well with the goals of achieving growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their proposed allocation of incentives, targeted towards high-value vaults and LP pools, demonstrates a strategic approach to maximize TVL and yield for users. Additionally, the provision for users to stake ARB tokens into Harvest vaults further promotes stickiness and long-term engagement within the ecosystem. Overall, Harvest's proposal presents a compelling case for supporting their initiatives on Arbitrum. \n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis grant suffered in two main areas. The milestones do not suitably hold the grantee accountable for increasing users or assets on Arbitrum, instead focusing on distribution of the grant itself.

All funds will be managed using the non-custodial tooling of Zodiac Modules and Aera Vaults. This tooling permits the DAO to retain oversight and ownership of the funds at all times while only allowing specific strategies to be employed by the ASTMG. The costs incurred from this initiative are a 1% management fee on the AUM of the ASTMG and a $180k ARB annual budget to support the DAO Oversight Committee.\n\nKey outcomes supported by voting favourably on this proposal are:\n1. Supporting the allocation of 250 million ARB towards the ASTMG managed by karpatkey.\n2. The DAO Oversight Committee will be established to serve as the accountability and communication layer between the Arbitrum DAO and the ASTMG.\n\n### Full Proposal Description\nPlease review the proposal forum post for a full proposal description: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301)\n\n## Motivation\nArbitrum has 3rd largest treasury of any DAO, but the treasury is unutilised mainly, posing threats to the sustainability and efficient resource allocation of the DAO. Effective treasury management will help the Arbitrum DAO achieve the following three goals:\n\n1. **Ensuring long-term sustainability:** treasury should be able to support ecosystem efforts throughout market cycles; in the long run, DAO should be a self-sustaining vehicle, with expenses covered by yield generated from Treasury, without having to materially compromise on Treasury principal.\n2. **Fostering ecosystem growth:** treasury should be used to foster a vibrant community of users and builders. The DAO should utilise strategies such as protocol-owned liquidity to support sustainable liquidity across the ecosystem.\n3. **Transparency and accountability:** treasury should be expertly managed, and uses of the treasury should be transparent and held accountable to the DAO\n\n## Rationale\nThe ASTMG's overarching objective is to act as the asset allocator for the Arbitrum ecosystem to ensure effective treasury management. This is the crucial first step to ensuring the DAO's sustainability.\n\n## Specifications\nThree main areas of priority for ASTMG would be:\n\n1. **Ecosystem alignment and growth.** Bolster ecosystem growth by utilising Arbitrum's treasury via protocol-owned liquidity (POL) and allow ecosystem grant recipients a swap program to convert ARB into other assets (stables or ETH).\n2. **Fortress balance sheet.** Diversify Arbitrum treasury to build strong runways and resiliency to market downturns by reducing long-tail asset exposure, and ensuring 1-year financial runway.\n3. **Sustainability.** Generating sustainable yields to fund the DAO's operations.\n\nThe priorities would result in the following deliverables:\n- **Yield Optimisation Program:** to generate sustainable yields to fund the DAO's operations in a non-custodial and risk-minimised manner.\n- **DAO Owned Liquidity Program:** to expand ecosystem liquidity, attract builders to Arbitrum, and deepen ARB on-chain liquidity.\n**Treasury Swaps Program:** execute swaps with partner DAO treasuries with guidance from the DAO Oversight Committee.\n- **Treasury Diversification Program:** to reduce long-tail asset exposure and capital raising.\n\nThe DAO Oversight Committee will serve as a layer of checks & balances between the ASTMG and the DAO and will be responsible for:\n 1. Setting of treasury management mandate and guardrails together with ASTMG.\n 2. Ensuring accuracy of reporting and compliance with the mandate.\n 3. Acting as DAO Liaison.\n\nFurther details on platforms and technologies and the design of the ASTMG can be seen in the [full forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301?u=karpatkey).\n\n## Steps & Timeline\nThe proposers (karpatkey, Gauntlet) have engaged in extensive discussions with the ArbitrumDAO community.

The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain. This will be helpful for newcomers, tooling providers, and experienced governooors alike.\n\n**Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.**\n\n**Background**\n\nEIP-4824 is a DAO metadata standard, akin to ERC-721 for NFTs. It has already been adopted by Snapshot, Aragon, Treasure, 1inch, Optimism Collective (through the Optimism Foundation), and multiple frameworks and DAOs. The adoption efforts are supported through grants from the Ethereum Foundation, Optimism Collective, ENS, Gnosis, Solana and many other stakeholders of the web3 ecosystem. \n\nDAOstar is also an Arbitrum Foundation grantee. The grant aims to improve the adoption of EIP-4824 within the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are allocating a portion of that grant to steward this proposal, and are requesting no additional funds from the DAO. \n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is one of the largest DAOs. It has one of the most active governances, in terms of number participants as well as community-led initiatives. All of this activity, along with the scale and complexity of the Arbitrum DAO breeds a lot of metadata. This dataset grows with every new initiative and has multiple components that may not be very visible from the \u201coutside\u201d. For example, consider the following questions:\n\n1. Who are the current Security Council, Arbitrum Research & Development Collective, Procurement Committee members? (Answer: you can search the respective forum post to find this)\n2. Can you share a location that tracks all DAO-owned/managed multisig addresses? (Answer: this could be [https://www.arbwallets.xyz/ ](https://www.arbwallets.xyz/))\n3. Can you share a status update on the DAO\u2019s grant spending? (Answer: R3gen Finance reports this on the forum)\n4. Where can we see delegate performance? (Answer: KarmaGAP or Tally)\n5. How much in sequencer fees is being collected? (Answer: there is a dashboard for this)\n6. What orbit chains exist? (Answer: the ecosystem page tracks this)\n7. Where to find recordings and transcripts of public meetings? (Answer: I\u2019m not sure!)\n\nFor an active participant, these answers might not be very hard to find. But for the majority of people who are not active participants of the DAO, and even for tooling providers, collecting this information requires a painstaking amount of manual effort. This leads to inconsistencies, errors and outdated information.\n\nThe same concern echoes over the entire DAO ecosystem. There are over 200 DAOs at the moment with a treasury size of over $1M, and collecting information on them manually is becoming an exponentially difficult task. EIP-4824 was authored by DAOstar with the support from the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Etherscan, DeepDAO, Snapshot, and a large number of DAO tooling companies, to create a better infrastructure for DAO data.\n\nAdopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. daoURIs have a standard JSON-LD format:\n\n```\n{\n\"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n\"type\": \"DAO\",\n\"name\": \"<name of the DAO>\",\n\"description\": \"<description>\",\n\"membersURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"proposalsURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"activityLogURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"governanceURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"contractsRegistryURI\": \"<URI>\"\n}\n```\n\nIt contains information on governance, members, activities and contracts by default. Outside of the endpoints mentioned above, a DAO can also choose to publish information that is specifically important to it. For Arbitrum, this could be information about orbit chains, different multi-sigs and councils, spending, sequencer fees, link to its constitution, etc. Essentially, **the daoURI creates an \u201cofficial repository\u201d of information on the DAO.**\n\nHere are some examples of how the daoURI could be used:\n\n1. It can be used to bring more context to contracts on block explorers. For example, we could go from this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeicwwhselbr7texz3p6uev2wjfqmeylq64jyc44ylgo3fd7gn27qqu)\n    \n\nto this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiavyesuvk34jjrqtxnww4qgnhtykge2k5su2zah4ktjapr3sir42u)\n    \n\n2. We can make DAO data easily and freely available to everyone\n\nFor example, Arbitrum DAO\u2019s current DeepDAO profile misses a ton of info - contracts, or revenue, or governance guardrails (councils and multi-sigs), etc. Messari\u2019s Arbitrum DAO dashboard requires a paid membership to access, which could also be due to the difficulty of collecting and presenting DAO data (thus making it too valuable to give away for free). By making access to this information easy, we can greatly improve the DAO\u2019s transparency. i.e, go from:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidmobzr2ipdsu5j7gbzfonm5bmiwa5g77p4p22dugugzviblhyfju)\n    \n\nto this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiac35d73dgjnruhph4pmhxay3f5sh3psz4wkd3h2zsc75yb4ny23i)\n    \n    \n\n3. daoURI makes it much easier to structure metadata improvements.\n\nA specific example that surfaced during Arbitrum GovHack (*thanks to Paulo Fonseca)*: onchain proposals at Arbitrum DAO (or any DAO for that matter) do not reference a forum discussion. This takes away a lot of available information. If we wanted to change this, we could achieve it easily by enforcing a discussionURI field inside the proposalURI (which is a standard component of daoURI). Tally, Aragon, Snapshot X, and most governance tooling providers are members of DAOstar. Extending the standard will create an easy upgrade pathway for them and this change would reflect the change across the ecosystem.\n\nTo summarize, a daoURI creates a source of truth that is easily accessible by onchain and offchain tools. This proposal carries no additional cost, or changes to any existing smart contract or process. It\u2019s a step in the right direction with no downside.\n\n**Specifications** \n\nAs mentioned above, adopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. There are various ways to do this:  \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreid5wi5tx3k2kinx4ew5ofuotwxztedbdhtolay4lpc3utg75pojwe)\n    \n\nBased on Arbitrum DAO's characteristics, we suggest the following adoption pathways:\n\n1. Executing a simple contract call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory which'll deploys a new registration contract to store the daoURI. The registration will be on Arbitrum One network, setting the DAO\u2019s governor timelock as admin, and a manager as the DAO decides. This would require a constitutional proposal. \n\n2. Set a new 'daoURI' txt record on arbitrumfoundation.eth. Arbitrum Foundation will have complete edit access to this daoURI as they own arbitrumfoundation.eth. A daoURI published through this method will not be editable via an onchain vote. However, this method is in some sense easier than the previous, and it requires no onchain vote. This would be a non-constitutional proposal. When the time comes, the DAO can also adopt EIP-4824 through method 1 to have full control over its data. \n\nTransactions for reference: [Unlock Protocol](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/88514909609252335816460489315313822288366112768901791852399180053604763902892), [Treasure](https://snapshot.org/#/treasuregaming.eth/proposal/0x957349f6d60f07e95d6e426536996af96ca63f0b9e0495ee8e73554207cb2381) and [1inch](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xc25a02d6520fd69ae98ef10b72f3024db2e710d00d51fbc7c03581710e0b8b7b) \n\n**Steps to Implement** \n\n**Create a daoURI for Arbitrum DAO:** Based on conversations during the Arbitrum GovHack, and feedback from various delegates and contributors over the past 4 weeks, we have built this daoURI for Arbitrum: \n\n[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUrBuJLBCZKnnEebwRe2Yqh3fk39H2mtqPQjMPUwVC1Ap](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUrBuJLBCZKnnEebwRe2Yqh3fk39H2mtqPQjMPUwVC1Ap)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidxb7bo3femntln3qka2de3czdxe6eeys3g62v6enosx5admm6eua)\n    \n\nIt is presently stored on IPFS, and uses APIs from Tally, Snapshot for governance data. We recommend that if the Arbitrum Foundation ends up being the manager, the daoURI be stored in their GitHub for ease of editing, and higher transparency. DAOstar will work with the Foundation on implementation. \n\nNote that this is a starting point. The daoURI of Arbitrum DAO will continuously evolve and become more comprehensive over time.\n\n**Publish the daoURI onchain:** As detailed in the execution summary above, this will either be a  smart contract call to deploy a new contract, or setting a new txt record on arbitrumfoundation.eth \n\n**Maintain the daoURI:** (Pathway 1) Though daoURI is fully manageable through governance, it is not practical to initiate an onchain vote for every upgrade. To solve this, the DAO can set one or many *manager*s to manage its daoURI. The Arbitrum Foundation has agreed to take on this role if the DAO decides so. DAOstar will commit to maintaining Arbitrum DAO\u2019s daoURI for a year for at additional cost. Note that *managers* can be added or removed easily by the DAO. \n\n(Pathway 2) The DAO will not have the capability to change the daoURI through governance. However, it can instruct the Arbitrum Foundation to do so. \n\nIrrespective of the adoption pathway, we would like to see the daoURI maintained through a community-led effort. We suggest that whoever is set as a *manager* maintain a forum discussion to discuss updates. That way, any Arbitrum DAO member can publicly request to add a missing piece of info to the daoURI.\n\n**Timeline** \n\nUnless the DAO has any feedback on the daoURI above, this proposal is ready for execution. \n\n**Overall Cost** \nThis proposal does not require any transfer of funds from the DAO treasury.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "1824491a-a9b6-4a1e-8250-49f21cac6a01", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x1f7db74aa7a72a47e607817c06f26455970e4807ac8c8915b088b0c3fe5ab5ba", "title": "Lido LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1f7db74aa7a72a47e607817c06f26455970e4807ac8c8915b088b0c3fe5ab5ba", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [109271950.165401, 3202045.6739413543, 35704430.66398805], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.494", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/lido-ltipp-application-draft/21716\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nOverall, Lido presented a really thorough and great proposal. They provided a very detailed execution plan, grant justification, quantifiable milestones that are easily trackable. Co-contribution of incentives also helps ensure liquidity stickiness in addition to the further integrations of wstETH across Arbitrum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem. Creating deep LST liquidity will considerably strengthen Arbitrum\u2019s competitive position.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal from Lido DAO's Liquidity Observation Labs (LOL) demonstrates a clear and comprehensive strategy to drive the adoption and usage of wstETH on Arbitrum. Their past success in growing wstETH on other Layer-2 networks, combined with a detailed plan for incentivization, integration, and measurement of success, instill confidence in their ability to achieve their objectives. The team's experience in managing previous grants and their focus on long-term sustainability and growth are evident. With a well-thought-out execution plan, including incentivizing liquidity pools, governance token pairs, and leveraged staking protocols, this proposal seems poised to significantly increase wstETH activity on Arbitrum, contributing to the broader expansion of the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. We really like their strategy of matching the grant incentives post the LTIPP grants are over to maintain the liquidity on the protocol. Additionally, Lido is one of the most influential applications in the DeFi ecosystem. Their Wrapped Staked ETH (wstETH) has received traction on the platform without incentives. wstETH with enough liquidity could be a foundational staked asset on the chain, the additional liquidity allowing more projects to integrate the token and give users less reason to return back to the mainnet for wstETH buying/bridging. The LOL is also willing to match the grant request, further making this a good return on investment for the DAO. The KPIs and Milestones look fine to me. Overall, this proposal shows promise and deserves support.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\n\"Vote FOR Lido's proposal.\n\nWell thought out proposal and strongly ranked in the rubric. They've been a leader in the space and, with the success of folks like Blast and LRTs building on EigenLayer, it's in Arbitrum's best interests to maintain deep liquidity for LSTs. Lido has been well Arbitrum aligned, incentivizing liquidity here since its initial wstETH deployment. Also great to see co-contribution of incentives as well as partnerships with other DeFi protocols on Arbitrum will contribute towards stickier liquidity. There is the natural concern of overall market share (30%+) to weigh but feel it's a competitive proposal to let the DAO decide.\"", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "18a90975-219f-4669-8db6-da89e7fb7813", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x2f095c9b8bc01b0c0d1b9355c8451dc63458a498f3761c04bf3567ce5c592af6", "title": "Pyth LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0xF92F185AbD9E00F56cb11B0b709029633d1E37B4", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2f095c9b8bc01b0c0d1b9355c8451dc63458a498f3761c04bf3567ce5c592af6", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [145244931.07139438, 100855.33068055006, 338809.50697791844], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.659", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nImproving oracle diversity on a chain increases the resilience of the ecosystem, not only because protocols have more choices of oracle provider, but also because protocols can use combinations of oracle providers for different risk profiles, asset types, and as failsafes in the event of a primary oracle failure. \nThis grant plan\u2019s main weakness is the large spend. The cost per additional oracle is considerably higher than other oracle provider grant applications. Pyth, however, has a demonstrated ability to gain adoption on Arbitrum, and also provide more exotic or esoteric oracle feeds by virtue of the sheer number of feeds.

To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.\n\nWe are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.\n\nFor existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20).\n\nThanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum\u2019s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe proposed extension of the Pyth Network\u2019s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14\\.\n\nBefore the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.\n\nPyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.\n\nThe request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.\n\nThis strategy strengthens Arbitrum\u2019s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nThis proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx\n\n# Specifications\n\n* 13 weeks duration  \n* 175,000 ARB\n\nThe proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program\u201412 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.\n\nThis increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix\u2019s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base\u2014both without additional incentives in place.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.\n\nAs during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525), and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.\n\nSince this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.\n\nIf approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.\n\nThe proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThe cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB\u2014funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated\u2014of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.\n\nWe are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth\u2019s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.\n\n# Additional Context\n\nWe have been actively seeking feedback and advice from [@Matt_StableLab](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_stablelab) to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.\n\nOur interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10).\n\nCurrently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute.

Stablecoins, while a competitive sector, are a primitive necessity for DeFi. It is one of the few sectors where you want a lot of competition because there are generally a lot of different approaches to a solution. Additionally, Verified USD wants to utilize the adoption of RWAs in their stablecoin model, which has some novelty. The team's proactive engagement with key partners such as Fiat24 and MugglePay, coupled with their track record of successful liquidity programs and ecosystem support, instills confidence in their ability to effectively utilize the grant funds to foster growth and innovation within the Arbitrum network. Additionally, their willingness to accept linear funding and the oversight of a multisig further ensures accountability and transparency throughout the grant execution process. Overall, this proposal aligns with the goals of promoting ecosystem development and advancing the utility of USDV within Arbitrum, making it a compelling candidate for approval. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Verified USD's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across rubric (execution plan, grant justification, breakdown, milestones, etc.). Interesting opportunity to drive greater USDV adoption on Arbitrum from other ecosystems. Would have liked to see more justification re: why MugglePlay / Fiat24 as strategic partners for integration over others and also to fully confirm whether rebates to MugglePay/Fiat24 are to partners or directly to end-users.

Our recent progress, detailed in the ArbitrumHub Platform Successful Completion Report 1, demonstrates our commitment to creating a user-friendly platform for community members. This report highlights our initiatives and milestones, showcasing ArbitrumHub as a reliable source for essential information and community engagement within the ArbitrumDAO ecosystem.\n\nArbitrumHub\u2019s vision is to be the go-to destination for comprehensive information about ArbitrumDAO and its initiatives. We aim to offer a unified platform for community updates, meeting information, and insights into upcoming events. Our strategy includes robust community participation, ensuring stakeholders have immediate access to critical information.\n\nThis proposal details the next steps, upcoming features, technical enhancements, and the implementation timeline for ArbitrumHub. Our goal is to establish ArbitrumHub as the ultimate platform, underpinned by strong foundations in security, design, development, research, management, transparency, and incentivized community contributions.\n\nWe will manage the platform and the ArbitrumHUB Twitter account 2 to ensure the community can easily navigate and utilize all resources effectively.\n\n# Motivation\nArbitrumHub addresses the need for a centralized resource within the ArbitrumDAO community. As the ecosystem grows, staying informed and connected becomes increasingly challenging. ArbitrumHub simplifies this by consolidating essential information and resources in one place, offering structured and reliable information.\n\n# Uses of ArbitrumHub:\nReal-Time Updates: Provides and integrates the latest news sources and developments within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nCommunity Interaction Updates: Keeps the community informed about upcoming meetups and interactions.\n\nEvent Coordination: Details events and workshops for easy participation.\n\nSupport and Resources: Offers support for platform-related queries.\n\nEnhanced Visibility: Utilizes social media and newsletters for increased engagement.\n\nComprehensive Resource Integration: Aggregates developer tools, grant information, and other initiatives.\n\nCommunity Participation: Designed to foster incentivized community participation and contributions through meets, events, educational resources, etc.\n\nAmbassador Highlights: Acts as a central directory to provide updates related to ambassador activities and programs, with direct access for ambassadors to keep all their initiatives in one place for easy access.\n\nWe have been active in the community for a long time, but when we started, we faced numerous hurdles in obtaining the information we needed. This is a common issue, resulting in the loss of many new members facing this problem. With ArbitrumHUB, this will be a thing of the past, and ArbitrumDAO will attract many new members.

For instance, a previous initiative saw a 150% increase in TVL over a six-week period. This success underpins our confidence in achieving the set targets.\n    - **Incentive Plans:**\n        - **Liquidity Provider Incentives:** To achieve a $6M TVL with a competitive 20% APR, the required incentive is calculated at $1,200,000 annually. For the specific campaign period of 12 weeks, this translates to an estimated need of $266,666. At an ARB price of $1.15 (as of April 25, 2024), this equates to approximately 231,883 ARB tokens.\n        - **Trading Volume Incentives:** Aiming for a $15M daily trading volume requires incentives for trading fee rebates projected at $130,000 over 12 weeks. This corresponds to about 113,043 ARB tokens, recalculated with the current ARB price of $1.15.\n2. **We have added detailed milestones:**\n    \n    **Grant Timeline and Milestones:**\n    \n    - **Milestone 1:** Successfully deploy the dPoints system on Arbitrum.

The modernized version introduces an additional function that enables the Upgrade Executor to execute an upgrade by directly calling the target contract, rather than indirectly delegate calling an upgrade contract. As a result, future governance actions can be executed more simply and with fewer contract deployments.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Upgrade Executors controlled by the DAO are responsible for carrying out critical upgrades on [Arbitrum One](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#code), [Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482), and [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#code) such as protocol contract upgrades, system parameter changes, and more. Currently, the traditional Upgrade Executor contracts in place only support one function for executing an upgrade: [execute()](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#writeProxyContract#F1). When called by the owner of the Upgrade Executor, the execute() function delegate calls an upgrade contract, which facilitates subsequent calls to target contracts and ultimately executes the upgrade. This indirect method of calling and execution can complicate upgrades and require additional development and deployments.\n\nThe modern version of the Upgrade Executor introduces a new function, [executeCall()](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/eaa9d607464abb8683a3fe526acbf6d877f924e0/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol#L73), which allows the Upgrade Executor to directly call target contracts and execute upgrades, removing the need for delegate calls to upgrade contracts. While the existing execute() call is still supported, the new executeCall() function enables the Upgrade Executor to implement upgrades in a lighter weight fashion. In the future, upgrades that use this method may not require dedicated action contracts, simplifying the process and saving development energy.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Upgrade Executor: A smart contract responsible for executing upgrades on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Ethereum mainnet; owned and administered by the DAO\n* Upgrade Contract: A smart contract that contains dedicated logic for a particular upgrade; receives a call from the Upgrade Executor and subsequently calls other contracts targeted in that upgrade\n* execute(): The sole function for executing an upgrade in existing Upgrade Executor implementations; relies on indirect delegate calls to upgrade contracts\n* executeCall(): A [new function](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/eaa9d607464abb8683a3fe526acbf6d877f924e0/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol#L73) for executing an upgrade in the modern Upgrade Executor implementation; allows for direct calls to target contracts\n\n# Specifications\n\n* Deploy the latest [UpgradeExecutor](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/upgrade-executor/blob/main/src/UpgradeExecutor.sol) contract on each network\n* Update proxy contracts on each network to reflect new UpgradeExecutor addresses:\n     * Arbitrum One: [0xCF57572261c7c2BCF21ffD220ea7d1a27D40A827](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#code)\n          * [upgradeTo](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf57572261c7c2bcf21ffd220ea7d1a27d40a827#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n     * Arbitrum Nova: [0x86a02dD71363c440b21F4c0E5B2Ad01Ffe1A7482](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482)\n          * [upgradeTo](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x86a02dd71363c440b21f4c0e5b2ad01ffe1a7482#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n     * Ethereum: [0x3ffFbAdAF827559da092217e474760E2b2c3CeDd](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#code)\n          * [upgradeTo](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fffbadaf827559da092217e474760e2b2c3cedd#writeContract#F4): 0x3d745b8815F9be5BF053858165f8aB1F58c77932\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n1.

The Attackathon will focus on enhancing the security of the Ethereum protocol through three phases: education, active code hunting, and result evaluation. The initiative aims to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 already committed from the Ethereum Foundation. This effort is crucial for ensuring the stability and security of Ethereum, which is vital for maintaining the reliability of projects on Arbitrum.\n\n### Motivation  \nAs a Layer 2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum relies heavily on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Given Arbitrum\u2019s EVM compatibility, vulnerabilities in Ethereum could potentially impact Arbitrum as well. Conducting a comprehensive security audit contest at this time is critical due to the recent major hard forks that have introduced significant changes to Ethereum.\n\nA key component of this Attackathon is the development of educational materials that cater to all levels of security knowledge. This educational program will feature live technical walkthroughs and detailed documentation developed by the Ethereum Foundation, client teams, Solidity developers, and Immunefi, covering a broad scope that includes client, specification, and solidity compiler bugs. By educating security researchers, the Attackathon will cultivate a community of researchers capable of identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities across the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems. This increased awareness and participation in Ethereum\u2019s security ultimately benefits the Arbitrum community by ensuring the continued reliability and safety of the underlying blockchain infrastructure.\n\n### Rationale  \nThe Attackathon aligns with the Arbitrum community\u2019s mission to promote a secure and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. By investing in this initiative, Arbitrum will help Ethereum\u2019s security, which directly impacts Arbitrum\u2019s scalability and user trust. Moreover, the educational component of the Attackathon will benefit Arbitrum by upskilling security researchers, providing them with the knowledge and tools needed to conduct thorough audits and improve security across the network.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum can benefit from the collaborative efforts of the Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi, positioning itself as a proactive leader in the Ethereum community. Participation in the Attackathon provides Arbitrum with the opportunity to engage with top security researchers and improve its security posture. As a sponsor, Arbitrum will gain visibility and credibility among developers and users, further solidifying its reputation as secure and forward-thinking.\n\n### Key Terms  \n- **Attackathon:** A comprehensive and time-boxed security audit event involving education, active vulnerability hunting, and result evaluation phases.  \n- **Immunefi:** A leading bug bounty platform specializing in blockchain and smart contract security.  \n- **Hard Fork:** Significant upgrades or changes to the protocol that may introduce new code and, potentially, new vulnerabilities.  \n- **Solidity Compiler:** The tool used to compile Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity into bytecode, which is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\n### Specifications  \n#### Platforms and Technologies:  \n- **Ethereum Protocol:** The primary focus of the security audit, with an emphasis on identifying vulnerabilities in core protocol code, client software, and the Solidity compiler.  \n- **Immunefi:** The platform hosting the Attackathon, responsible for managing submissions, triaging bug reports, and distributing rewards.  \n- **Ethereum Foundation:** Providing funding and oversight for the Attackathon, including contributions to the reward pool and logistical support.\n\n#### Design Decisions:  \n- **Scope:** The contest will have a broad scope including specification bugs, client bugs, deposit contract bugs, and Solidity compiler vulnerabilities.  \n- **Inclusion of the Solidity Compiler:** By including the Solidity compiler in the scope, the Attackathon directly addresses potential vulnerabilities in the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, which is crucial for both Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n\n### Related Work  \n- **Ethereum Bug Bounty Program:** The permanent bug bounty program has been effective but lacks visibility. The Attackathon aims to increase participation and awareness through a focused, large-scale event.\n\n### Steps to Implement  \nThe primary role of the Arbitrum DAO in this initiative is to provide funding support for the Attackathon. By contributing to the reward pool, Arbitrum will ensure that the event attracts top-tier security researchers and maximizes its impact on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Additionally, the Arbitrum community can assist in promoting the Attackathon to raise awareness and encourage participation.\n\n### Estimated Timeline  \n- **July 8-11:** EthCC program announcement  \n- **Aug 19th:** Detailed program announcement and education kickoff  \n- **September 2nd:** Attackathon hunting begins  \n- **October 27th:** Attackathon concludes, and results compilation begins  \n- **October 28th:** Review period begins  \n- **Early January:** Results announced\n\n### Overall Cost  \nThe Arbitrum DAO has two options for sponsoring the Attackathon:\n\n#### Unicorn Partners (+75 ETH Commitment) (limited to two sponsors)\n- 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank  \n- Participation in Attackathon Kick-off Twitter Space as a partner speaker  \n- Leaderboard Placement on Sponsor page  \n- Top-tier logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page  \n- Top-tier logo placement on the Program Education page and program report  \n- Call out in Press Releases and EF and Immunefi Program Announcement Blogs  \n- Digital Logo Placement in the results announcement at Devcon or a dedicated virtual event  \n- An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program  \n- 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\n#### Panda Partners (+30 ETH Commitment)\n- 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank  \n- Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page  \n- Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page  \n- An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program  \n- 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\nBy supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum can leverage the findings to ensure its network remains robust against vulnerabilities.

**Abstract**\nThe \"**Infinite Launchpad**\" aims to provide builders with seamless support at every stage and empower our developer base to secure Arbitrum as a leading force in innovation and growth within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBorn out of the [Betting on Builders](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-6-builder-pathways-towards-adoption/21510) proposal from GovHack at ETHDenver, we are presenting a collaborative accelerator program strategy, expected to run from Q3-2024 through Q4-2025. This strategy acts as proof-of-concept for a pathway that any accelerator initiative can participate in. To begin, [EVM Capital](https://www.evmcapital.com/), [RnDAO](https://www.rndao.io/) and [Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io/) are partnering on this proposal to launch the initiative, collect data, and establish best practices.\n\n## **Motivation**\nAccording to [ThankARB](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thankarb-a-strategy-framework-platform-for-arbitrum-s-success/19130):\n\n    \u201c[Arbitrum has] more developers than most chains, but we don\u2019t currently know how to best mobilize them for the benefit of the ecosystem.\u201d \n\nWe would like to try our hand at answering this question.\n\n## **Rationale**\nWe are asking the DAO to allot $10m in ARB to provide a clear incubation track that propels innovations that leverage Arbitrum stack to deliver dapps and protocols.\n\nHow this fits into [Arbitrums strategic priorities](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thankarb-a-strategy-framework-platform-for-arbitrum-s-success/19130): \n\n* Robust DevRel\n* Governance optimization\n* Future-proofing\n* Growing the community\n\n## **Specifications**\nThe \"Infinite Launchpad\" suite of programs work together to support projects at any stage.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJUqDBPSR.jpg)\n\n#### Community Building Module (Support for Other Programs)\nAttracting talent into the Arbitrum ecosystem to nurture the whole pipeline with founders, projects, and skilled contributors.

Acknowledging the STIP\u2019s instrumental role in the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, this proposal seeks to extend its positive impact by introducing a gas rebate and trading incentive program created by Rage Trade, a native perp aggregator on Arbitrum. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only complement the milestones achieved by the STIP but also to significantly increase the influx of new traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMotivation:\nAs the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) kicks off, it sets the stage for the Arbitrum ecosystem to experience amplified growth. The STIP is poised to play a pivotal role in promoting on-chain activities and reinforcing key protocols. However, there is plenty of opportunity to intensify user engagement and participation, especially when considering innovative platforms like Rage Trade.\n\nThis proposal is driven by the ambition to harness this potential, acting synergistically with the anticipated successes of the STIP. Through Rage Trade\u2019s introduction of a gas rebate and trading incentive program, our objective is not just to elevate trading activity, but also to enhance the overall user experience, attracting and onboarding new traders to the ecosystem. This effort is geared towards empowering platforms that, in line with Arbitrum\u2019s vision, are poised for growth but require additional support to maximize their contribution.\n\nRationale:\n\nThis proposal aligns with Arbitrum\u2019s mission to foster a dynamic and engaged community. By allocating 100% of the grant funds to create a gas rebate and trading incentives program, Rage Trade\u2019s platform aims to refine the user experience of traders while offering gas savings and trading incentives to stimulate a competitive yet cooperative environment.\n\nSpecifications: A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.\nRage Trade Platform:\n\nAs a prime broker and perpetual aggregator, Rage Trade unifies top decentralized perpetual exchanges across all EVM-compatible chains. It streamlines the trading experience by eliminating complexities associated with collateral and gas fund management, ensuring a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly environment for traders.\n\nGas Tank Mechanism:\n\nThe Gas Tank is a unique feature of Rage Trade that simplifies trading across different chains. Users deposit funds into their account, and a portion goes into the Gas Tank. This fund is then used to cover gas fees across various chains, eliminating the need for users to manage gas fees separately.\n\nSession-Based Trading System:\n\nRage Trade employs a session-based trading system where users create a session that lasts for a specified duration (e.g., 7 days). This system reduces the need for manual transaction signing, making the trading experience smoother and more akin to centralized exchanges.\n\nMulti-Leg Trading and Auto-Populating Bridge:\n\nThe platform allows users to create multiple trades from different chains and perps on Arbitrum, enabling them to spread risk and optimize execution. Additionally, Rage Trade handles all the bridging details, automatically selecting the best bridge or swap routes for seamless trade execution.\n\nCustom Route Selection:\n\nUsers have the option to split their orders based on various criteria such as best execution price, lowest funding fees, or routes with bonuses like emissions or airdrops. This feature provides flexibility and optimization for trade execution.\n\nAggregated Referral & Competitions:\n\nRage Trade aggregates referrals and competitions across different perp protocols, allowing users to participate in various trading competitions and referral programs through a single platform.\n\nIncentive Distribution:\n\nThe proposal involves the distribution of 1.5 million ARB tokens to incentivize trading volume on Rage Trade. The distribution will be structured to reward active traders and participants in trading competitions, fostering increased engagement and liquidity on the platform.\n\nTrading Competitions:\n\nA series of trading competitions will be organized, with ARB tokens allocated as prizes. These competitions aim to attract traders, boost trading volume, and create a vibrant trading community on Rage Trade.\n\nUser Engagement and Performance Metrics:\nRage Trade has successfully cultivated a dynamic user base, boasting 70,000 active traders who regularly engage with our platform. This robust participation is a testament to our platform\u2019s appeal and functionality within the trading community.\n\nIn addition to our active traders, we have nurtured a strong Liquidity Provider (LP) community, with 26,000 LPs contributing to our ecosystem. This substantial number of LPs underscores our platform\u2019s reliability and the trust placed in us by those who provide liquidity, further cementing our role as a pivotal player in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our protocol\u2019s historical performance not only demonstrates significant growth and adoption but also highlights our consistent delivery of value to our users, traders, and liquidity providers. These metrics are indicative of our integral position within the Arbitrum ecosystem and our potential to further enhance and expand our offerings with sustained support.\n\nRage\u2019s Perpetual Performance:\n\nRage Trade v1 has experienced a remarkable market reception, evidenced by a staggering $735M in Total Trading Volume against Rage\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL). This impressive figure reflects the high demand and active engagement within our user base, showcasing the platform\u2019s appeal and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n962\u00d7642 21.9 KB\nRage\u2019s Vaults Performance:\n\nOur vault offerings, including the 80-20 Tricrypto Vault and GLP Vault, have achieved a notable peak TVL of approximately $19.87 million (at 100% max capacity since launch). This achievement highlights the trust and confidence users place in our vault products.\n\nAt its peak, Rage Trade accounted for about 1.4% of the entire Arbitrum TVL, marking our significant contribution to the overall ecosystem. This percentage represents our substantial impact and the value we add to the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThe 80-20 Tricrypto vault, in particular, has demonstrated exceptional performance. Over its 10-month lifespan, it outperformed holding GLP by 8%. Specifically, from July 2022 to April 2023, the 80-20 Tricrypto vault yielded a 44% return compared to a 36% return from merely holding GLP, showcasing its effectiveness and profitability.\n\nSteps to Implement: The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.\nTo implement this proposal, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring each phase contributes effectively to the overall goal. Here\u2019s how we plan to proceed:\n\nData Reporting and Transparency: Rage Trade is committed to transparency and will implement Dune dashboards for real-time tracking of all relevant metrics. These dashboards will ensure community members have access to up-to-date data, reflecting our progress and adherence to the commitments outlined in this proposal. This approach emphasizes our dedication to transparency and accountability within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIncentive Allocation: We will begin by using a portion of the ARB tokens for our gas rebate program to offset gas fees for our users. This will serve as the initial spark to ignite trading activities on the Rage Trade platform.\n\nFee Offset & Trading Competitions: We will then allocate the remaining tokens to incentivize trading, including trade competitions and offsetting fees implemented by integrated perp protocols. The trading competitions will be strategically scheduled over time to ensure ongoing participation and interest.\n\nRegular Updates and Reporting: Throughout the implementation, we will continuously monitor platform performance, trader engagement, and community feedback. This will allow us to make real-time adjustments and improvements where necessary. To maintain transparency, we will provide the community with regular updates and reports. These will include key performance metrics and insights gained from the implementation process.\n\nReview and Analysis: At the end of the implementation phase, we will conduct a thorough review. This will involve analyzing successes, identifying areas for improvement, and extracting key learnings for future initiatives.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to ensure not just the successful implementation of the proposal but also to contribute valuable insights for the continuous growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nTimeline: Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.\nThe implementation of this proposal is structured into a 4-month period, with each month focusing on specific objectives and milestones:\n\nMonth 1 - Initiation and Setup (Immediately upon approval):\n\nAllocation of ARB tokens to the designated multisig wallet to immediately initiate gas rebates and trading fee offsets. Setup of the Dune dashboard for tracking key metrics such as trading volume and unique traders. Announcement of the initiative and upcoming trading competitions to the community.\n\nMonth 2 - Launch of Trading Competitions:\n\nOfficial launch of the first set of trading competitions.\n\nActive monitoring of trading activities and engagement levels.\n\nFirst monthly update provided to the community, highlighting early results and trader participation.\n\nMonth 3 - Mid-term Review and Adjustments:\n\nComprehensive review of the first two months, analyzing trader engagement and competition outcomes.\n\nAdjustments made to competitions and incentives based on feedback and data analysis.\n\nSecond monthly update provided, including insights and any changes implemented.\n\nMonth 4 - Final Push and Comprehensive Analysis:\n\nContinued incentivization and promotion of trading activities.\n\nFinal monthly update provided, leading up to the comprehensive quarterly report.\n\nPreparation of the detailed analysis report, evaluating the proposal\u2019s success based on predefined objectives.\n\nPost-4-Month Period - Evaluation and Reporting:\n\nRelease of a comprehensive quarterly report, detailing the overall impact of the proposal on trading volume, trader engagement, and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Evaluation of the initiative\u2019s success and consideration of potential future actions based on the outcomes.\n\nThis timeline ensures a structured approach to implementing the proposal, with regular updates and transparency. It allows for adjustments based on real-time data and community feedback, ensuring the initiative remains aligned with its goal of driving growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nTo measure the success of achieving the grant objectives, we will focus on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nDaily Volume: Aiming for a 30-day moving average of $10M in daily volume.\nDaily Traders: Targeting a 30-day moving average of 300 unique traders.\nIntegration: Committing to integrate 1 or more perpetual DEXes per 2 weeks (accounting for audit time).\nThese KPIs will serve as benchmarks to gauge our progress and effectiveness in utilizing the grant to drive growth and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\nRage Trade aims to leverage the grant to attract a substantial influx of users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, bolstering user interaction, transaction volume, TVL, and overall activity.\n\nStrategically, Rage Trade will allocate ~ 33% of the grant to gas rebates, with the other ~ 66% of the grant being directed towards offsetting integrated perp protocols\u2019 trading fees and various trading competitions. The endgame is to amplify user onboarding and trading enthusiasm, resonating with genuine market dynamics.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to clarify that rebate rates will be determined by the genuine fees incurred by users. If our partnering protocols grant separate rebates or rewards, Rage Trade commits to ensuring that the total sum of rebates will never surpass the fees accrued. Throughout this promotional phase, trade-to-earn schemes will not be entertained. Additionally, the Rage Trade team will vigilantly deter and counteract wash trading and Sybil-attack incidents. Offending addresses linked with such activities will be publicly disclosed and denied the associated rebates.\n\nGas Rebates Explained:\nOnce a week, traders will receive ARB tokens as a gas rebate, mirroring the gas fees they\u2019ve incurred throughout the week. This rebate system ensures that users can trade more freely, knowing a portion of their gas fees will be returned. The gas rebate will be uniformly applied across all protocols integrated with Rage Trade on Arbitrum, ensuring fairness and consistency for all traders. The rebate amount a trader receives will be directly proportional to the actual gas fees they\u2019ve paid, eliminating any potential for manipulative practices like trade-to-earn schemes.\n\nFee Rebates Explained:\n\nARB tokens will be rewarded as fee rebates to our traders every Friday, reflecting the fees they\u2019ve accumulated over the week.\n\nThis fee waiver will be consistently applied across all collaborating protocols.\n\nTraders\u2019 rebate entitlements will strictly correlate with their actual trading fees, nullifying the chance for trade-to-earn practices. The rate of expenditure from the grant will be contingent on the volume of organic trading transpiring each week. The Rage Trade team pledges to continually identify and thwart wash trading and sybil-attack attempts.\n\nTo safeguard the integrity of the campaign, the specifics of the anti-wash-trading & anti-sybil-attack measures will be kept confidential and will be communicated post-event, mirroring best practices employed in protocol airdrop launches.\n\nExample of Fee Structure Post-Reduction:\n\nIf additional perps trading mechanisms in the Arbitrum realm are incorporated with Rage Trade amidst this campaign, the fee waiver will extend to those as well.\n\nIntegrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction\n\nGMX V1: 0.1% \u2192 0%\n\nGMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% \u2192 0%\n\nOverall Cost: The total cost to implement the AIP.\nThe total cost to implement this AIP for Rage Trade is 1.5M ARB tokens. This cost is solely dedicated to funding trading competitions and volume incentives on the Rage Trade platform. The breakdown is as follows:\n\nGas Rebates: 500k ARB tokens will be allocated for offsetting gas fees when trading perps on Arbitrum.\n\nTrading Fee Rebates & Competitions: The remaining 1m ARB will be used as trading fee offsets and trading competitions.\n\nThere are no additional costs involved in this proposal. The entire 1.5M ARB token request is focused on directly incentivizing users and enhancing their trading experience on Rage Trade.", "match_confidence": 0.9312, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "2255d466-1632-4f4d-8792-8f770674550a", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x07ac37df9f69f1cfc145a0badb32ec6e65e5ea3823d058ae5cffa6ecd080722f", "title": "Thetanuts Finance STIP Addendum", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x07ac37df9f69f1cfc145a0badb32ec6e65e5ea3823d058ae5cffa6ecd080722f", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-05-20 20:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "options": {"scores": [138239484.91907135, 234064.6990590399, 26724211.915472873], "choices": ["Approve funding", "Reject funding", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.225", "body": "## Background\n\n**Link to initial STIP application:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thetanuts-finance-final-stip-round-1/17539\n\n**Link to Addendum:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thetanuts-finance-stip-addendum/23374\n\n**ARB Requested:**\n200,000\n## Reasoning\n\n**Who proposed this challenge:** \nCattin - Seed Latam\n\n**Why this request needs a closer look:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thetanuts-finance-stip-addendum/23374/7", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "22d86f44-5727-473b-a6a7-e3e1a640bb32", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x611926bc9afd0e503e6722aa5fe8186ccc8c203dab12087fb9d930ae2cad492a", "title": "Stargate STIP Bridge Challenge", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x611926bc9afd0e503e6722aa5fe8186ccc8c203dab12087fb9d930ae2cad492a", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-05-20 20:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "options": {"scores": [123551881.22625431, 125388.4762923032, 27818281.769319683], "choices": ["Approve funding", "Reject funding", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.287", "body": "## Background\n\n**Link to initial STIP application:** https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stargate-finance-final-stip-round-1/17507\n\n**Link to Addendum:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-stargate-finance-stip-addendum/23743\n\n**ARB Requested:**\n750,000\n## Reasoning\n\n**Who proposed this challenge:** \nArbitrum DAO Automatic Submission\n\n**Why this request needs a closer look:** \nLate applications require an automatic challenge snapshot", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "23ce61b9-ab49-433b-a117-dcbed410dbf0", "proposal_id": "1a55fe98-8f1c-4335-9717-84e38d170f40", "snapshot_id": "0xcb75a551ec2c6ace70e904603e9e9445a7bc9e4255f5c67e150aa2e6f6256c75", "title": "Kwenta x Perennial: Arbitrum Onboarding Incentives", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xcb75a551ec2c6ace70e904603e9e9445a7bc9e4255f5c67e150aa2e6f6256c75", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-05-24 14:02:16", "voting_end": "2024-05-31 14:02:16", "options": {"scores": [123357840.7996578, 4007236.5907913744, 2152708.2655217648], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-05-31 14:02:16", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.201", "body": "[Please refer here for the entire proposal.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/kwenta-x-perennial-arbitrum-onboarding-incentives-updated/22736)\n\nKwenta, a prominent DeFi application in the Optimism ecosystem, is set to expand to Arbitrum, utilizing Perennial V2, an Arbitrum-native protocol.

This will help create a faster-moving selection system with more accountability, allowing the DAO to gather more insights into the results of the incentive campaigns.\n## Motivation\nThe LTIPP proposal included up to 200,000 ARB available for research on STIP, the Backfund, and the LTIP Pilot Program. The bounties guarantee the DAO will have multiple teams working on providing meaningful conclusions regarding the incentive programs. These conclusions will be essential to allow the DAO to possess all the information necessary to create the best possible long-term incentive framework.\nHowever, in its current format, it will take multiple months and many DAO votes to decide who will complete each bounty. This proposal aims to streamline that process so that more teams can research Arbitrum Incentives programs in a timely manner. By allowing the LTIPP council more freedom in using the bounty funds, we can move faster to start the bounties the same week as the start incentives.\n## Rationale\nThis new process not only speeds things up but also creates more accountability and can lead to more teams applying to fulfill bounties.\nDAO-wide votes to select who completes each bounty can become a popularity contest. This discourages less well-connected or busy researchers from applying, as they don\u2019t want to deal with the struggle of lobbying every delegate.\nHowever, allowing the elected LTIPP council to choose the most qualified teams without the researchers worrying about lobbying and DAO politics will encourage more bounty applications. This will lead to more options to choose from and result in better overall research being done.\nThis new process for selecting bounties also adds accountability, as the decision is made by a small group instead of the entire DAO. The DAO delegates might not want to take the time or have the expertise to read and understand each application. Additionally, it is hard to assign accountability for decisions when they are made by large groups like DAOs.\nHowever, with a smaller group making the decisions, more accountability and expertise will be placed in each decision, leading to better outcomes for the DAO. The LTIPP council comprises strong teams and individuals elected by the community who have the DAOs\u2019 best interests in mind. The council has intimate knowledge of the incentives programs and understands what needs to be studied to create a new and improved incentives program.\n## Specifications\nThe LTIPP proposal allocated a maximum of 200k ARB for research bounties. To streamline the process, this proposal allows the council to choose who fulfills each bounty. The proposed new bounty format is as follows.\n#### Bounty Submission\nStarting May 20th, researchers can apply for bounties by submitting applications on the forum. The council will put out a list of bounties they would like researched but researchers can also submit their own ideas for bounties.\n####  Bounty Feedback\nApplications for research bounties will be due June 3rd. The council and delegates will give feedback on the forum up until the 3rd to give feedback and allow people to alter their applications.\n#### Bounty Selection\nThe LTIPP council will then select which bounties to fund on June 10th. Researchers whose bounty is selected would start their research immediately upon selection. This will align nicely with the start of LTIPP incentives beginning on June 3rd.\n#### Bounty Payments\nResearchers will be paid half of their bounty upon completing KYC and half of it upon completing their bounty. The LTIPP workstream will monitor the bounties throughout the program to ensure the bounties are completed and payments are made.\n## Steps to Implement\n* Complete Snapshot vote to give more autonomy to the LTIPP council.\n* Have teams submit proposals for bounties\n* The council selects which bounties to fund\n* Research starts\n* Researcher\u2019s selected for bounties complete KYC\n* Half of the bounty is paid once KYC is completed\n* Half of the bounty is paid upon completion of the research\n## Timeline\n* Snapshot Vote: May 22 - May 29th\n* Application Period: May 22 - June 3rd\n* Selection Period: June 3rd - June 10th\n* Research: June 10th - September\n## Overall Cost\nThere is no additional cost to this proposal. The funding will come from the 200K arb budget from the LTIPP proposal.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "255ef4ae-1129-4867-9eb4-0944e491c5aa", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xd140d8bbbfd1a2b543675468e072a2ab3cc14a252119ff7fe7541aa048fe0153", "title": "PancakeSwap LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0x18BF1a97744539a348304E9d266aAc7d446a1582", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd140d8bbbfd1a2b543675468e072a2ab3cc14a252119ff7fe7541aa048fe0153", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [150916408.27070516, 4817760.413077293, 1804972.0716731811], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.445", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pancakeswap-ltipp-application-draft/21755\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nPancakeSwap presented a well rounded application as they boast a protocol that has been around for a while and features good usage metrics.

These emission programs are in place to be implemented, but need additional time to distribute ARB at reasonable reward rates.\n\nDue to some internal delay in launching GHO Safety Module and GHO Bridge, rewards for LM on Aave Protocol started later than expected, causing a delay in time and not being able to spend the amount allocated for ARB as planned.\n\n# Rationale\nThe currently implemented program has seen amazing success with over 5 million GHO bridged to Arbitrum that represents net new TVL for the ecosystem. Aave DAO plans to continue our incentive matching program with Merit once ARB incentives are fully utilized.\n\nHowever, due to the deplayed deployment in launching GHO Safety Module and GHO Bridge, rewards for LM on Aave Protocol started later than expected, causing a delay in time and not being able to spend that amount ARB as planned.\n\nAs a result, Aave DAO has not utilized the total amount of 375K ARB from the proposal earmarked for GHO deposit incentives and would like to seek an extension to avoid undue miscommunication and missed rewards for Arbitrum users.

This proposal intends to set up this subsidy fund, seeking up to $10 million worth of ARB to be administered and selected by the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018ADPC\u2019) to facilitate the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC\u2019s procurement framework. The ultimate decision will be made by the ADPC based on the Means Test and the Application Process Terms 13.\n\nProposal Request\nWe propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating up to $10 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThese subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.\n\nThe aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.\n\nThe figure of up to $10 million worth of ARB has been determined via a benchmarking exercise conducted with various security audit service providers. This form 4 was shared with these service providers and based on the responses of 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 50 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.\n\nWe ask delegates delegates to choose between following options for the initial size of the fund and length of the program:\n- Do not fund the program\n- 1 cohort of 8 weeks (2 months) for a total fund size of $2.5 million\n- 2 cohorts of 8 weeks each (4 months) for a total fund size of $5 million\n- 4 cohorts of 8 weeks each (8 months) for a total fund size of $10 million\n- Abstain\n\nPlease review the forum post (linked below) for a full proposal description and discussion.", "match_confidence": 0.7816, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "26417af6-bb43-46f4-bc8f-802c71808b27", "proposal_id": "d084ab5c-4680-4848-b8e0-03a27bdb35cf", "snapshot_id": "0x008f190725018c3db0e6464bf31d44f09a4d7773fd1486dff0c52c27b8aba289", "title": "[Non-Constitutional] - Updates to the DIP, The Complete 1.7 Version", "author_name": "0xAbAbE91A907fAdff921720C43ABe4098e7245E99", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x008f190725018c3db0e6464bf31d44f09a4d7773fd1486dff0c52c27b8aba289", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-07-31 22:00:00", "voting_end": "2025-08-07 22:00:00", "options": {"scores": [152230002.93846214, 767088.967409029, 36239934.52533026], "choices": ["For: Upgrade to v1.7", "Against: Keep v1.6", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-08-07 22:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:58.823", "body": "# Delegate Incentive Program V1.7\n\nFor the purpose of publishing the final text of the amended proposal on the public forum and Snapshot, we present it below:\n\n## **General parameters**\n\n### **Duration**\n\nThe program was initially approved for 12 months starting in November 2024; therefore, the last month of this iteration will be October 2025.\n\nArbitrumDAO may cancel the program or modify parameters, such as scoring methodology, through a Snapshot vote where the number of FOR votes to modify or wind down the initiative meets 3% of the votable supply level.

Civility and Professionalism\n\n- While separate from the Terms and Conditions, DIP Participants are expected to uphold the\u00a0[community guidelines](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807)\u00a0for activity on the Arbitrum DAO forum and de facto understood gathering places for the Arbitrum DAO, whether online or in-person.\n- DIP Participants should seek to create a respectful and inclusive environment for all community members, free from harassment and discrimination.\n    - Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:\n        - Publicly or privately harassing or intimidating others\n        - Sharing someone\u2019s private information without their consent\n        - Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwanted advances\n        - Making insulting or derogatory comments about others\n- DIP Participants should strive to provide constructive feedback that is well-researched and respectful, focusing on the proposal\u2019s merits. Personal attacks are never acceptable.\n- DIP Participants should be open-minded and respectful of differing viewpoints, even if they disagree with them. Disagreements are an inevitable part of healthy debate, but they often yield positive results when approached in a civil manner.\n- DIP Participants should make a best effort to provide constructive feedback through appropriate channels and avoid taking discussions to social media in a manner that could tarnish Arbitrum DAO\u2019s brand and reputation.\n- DIP Participants should avoid making unsubstantiated accusations that imply malice without proper evidence. They should conduct proper due diligence before making any public accusations via social media, public forums, or any other recognized communication channels. This includes exhausting all available avenues \u2014 for example, seeking clarification privately \u2014 before issuing any public statement that contains an unsubstantiated accusation about a DAO contributor.\n\n### 5. Responsibility\n\n- Maintaining a culture of productive debate, integrity, and transparency requires a sense of collective responsibility. As entrusted leaders of the Arbitrum community, DIP Participants should take responsibility in fostering and maintaining a culture that promotes the principles outlined herein.\n- Best practices of responsible DIP Participants:\n    - **Participation:**\u00a0DIP Participants should make an effort to vote (even if they vote abstain) on all proposals.\n    - **Communication:**\u00a0DIP Participants should clearly communicate their rationale behind votes and discussions to the Arbitrum community.\n    - **Accountability:**\u00a0DIP Participants should maintain knowledge of all DAO initiatives and hold managing parties or elected representatives accountable.\n    - **Responsiveness:**\u00a0DIP Participants should use their best efforts to connect with the Arbitrum community and be accessible to answer questions or concerns.\n\n### 6. Other Social Agreements\n\nDIP Participants must adhere to the remaining social agreements reached by the DAO, with the understanding that, if there are contradictions between a Social Agreement (such as the DAO\u2019s Code of Conduct) and the DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions, then the DIP\u2019s policies shall take precedence.\n\n### Enforcement & Appeal Process\n\nAll DIP Participants are expected to abide by the\u00a0**DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions**. The DIP\u2019s Program Manager is the one responsible for determining violations of the Terms and Conditions and reserves the right to take what it deems as appropriate action, which may include but is not limited to, issuing a penalty, a warning, suspension, or a total removal from the program. Any DAO member can raise a concern to the Program Manager concerning a DIP Participant failing to uphold the DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions, and the Program Manager must provide an answer; however, the final determination and resulting course of action will depend on the Program Manager and/or the Appeal Process.\n\nRegarding the\u00a0**appeals process**, the following mechanism had previously been defined:\n\n> The affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change, or revoke the Administrator\u2019s decision. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final.\n> \n\nIn the new iteration, appeals of any type of sanction (whether suspension or removal from the program) should be submitted by the affected DIP Participant to the Arbitrum Foundation, which would act as a neutral mediator in the situation and have the authority to ratify, change, or revoke the Program Manager\u2019s decision.\n\nIn the future and once OpCo is fully operational, responsibility for the resolution of conflicts\u00a0**can be**\u00a0transferred to the OpCo at the Program Manager\u2019s discretion. The Program Manager will acknowledge when this transfer can take place and make it public on the governance forum when it goes into effect.\n\n### **Requirements to Participate in the DIP**\n\nThe requirements to participate in the program are as follows:\n\n- **Voting Power: \u2265500,000 ARB:**\u00a0New delegates with \u2265500,000 ARB can apply in the subsequent month after they get that VP, unless they achieve it in the first 5 days of the month. DIP Participants should have this amount of VP for at least 25 days during the month*The Program Manager reserves the right to apply exceptions regarding this rule, as long as it provides a rationale for this decision.*DIP Participants already enrolled with less than 500,000 delegated ARB will be allowed to continue participating in the program. However, if in any given month they fail to meet the previous requirement (holding at least 50,000 delegated ARB for at least 85% or 25 days of the month) or any other requirement (as example maintaining a PR90\u226575%), they will be required to reapply and meet the 500,000 ARB threshold outlined in this proposal.\n- **Participation Rate (Karma): \u226575% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days:**\u00a0In the Tier X case, the requirement of having a PR90 \u2265 75% will not be enforced to apply, but moving forward, the delegates will still need to comply with this requirement during their participation. This means that new delegates with 500,000 ARB will not have to wait three months to join the program. However, once they reach a PR90 \u2265 75%, they will be required to maintain it to remain eligible. This is a natural requirement, as they will need to vote regularly on Tally to reach the 50 Total Participation points.\n- **Adhere to the DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions and any other Social Agreement:**\u00a0Each DIP Participant must adhere to the DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions and all social agreements reached through Snapshot, including those outlined in proposals such as \u2018[Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO\u2019s Operations](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x249a8e8aef5dc59da18b72e7d14ace5197ec6242675ab7f82b3d3f17f71bb13b),\u2019 \u2018[Should the DAO Create COI & Self Voting Policies](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbbec2fbf891d9abb21e8be380f79806519df8294d1d2cdce155d105fd1fed8db)?,\u2019 \u2018[Incentives Detox Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x99b57df3577e8e6561f3549b057bd87fdb7e66f65a7c45fddf63d9cd62f993d8),\u2019\u00a0[[Non-Constitutional] Arbitrum DAO Delegate Code of Conduct + Formalizing the DAO\u2019s Operations](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrum-dao-delegate-code-of-conduct-formalizing-the-daos-operations/27188)\u00a0and any other proposals or codes of conduct that may be approved in the future. If there are contradictions between a Social Agreement (such as the DAO\u2019s Code of Conduct) and the DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions, then the DIP\u2019s policies shall take precedence. Current DIP Participants are considered to\u00a0**automatically adhere to the DIP Terms and Conditions unless they state otherwise**. In this case, they will be excluded from the program, as adherence to these Terms and Conditions is a mandatory requirement for participation.\n\n### **Incentive Program Application**\n\nDelegates who meet the requirements must confirm their participation in the DIP via the\u00a0[DIP Application Thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945). Delegates can join the program anytime within 12 months, provided they meet the specified criteria. To minimize the potential for manipulation, delegates who sign up until the third day of the month will be included in the incentive calculations for that month.\u00a0*The Program Manager reserves the right to apply exceptions regarding this rule, as long as it provides a rationale for this decision.*\n\n### **Regarding DIP Participants\u2019 Compliance Process**\n\nIt is important to mention that it\u00a0**won\u2019t be necessary**\u00a0for the DIP Participants already registered to complete the compliance process again\n\n### **Incentive Program Application Template**\n\n- Forum Username (Link):\n- Twitter Profile (Link):\n- Telegram Username (Link or handle):\n- Snapshot Profile (Link):\n- Tally Profile (Link):\n- Wallet Address (Link to arbscan):\n- Participation Rate 90 days - Karma (Link):\n- COI Disclosure:\n- DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions Agreement:\u00a0*\"As a participating member of the Delegate Incentive Program, I declare that I have read and understand the DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions in its entirety, and therefore, adhere to it in its entirety, being aware that non-compliance may result in suspension or removal from the program, with the Arbitrum Foundation as the sole appeal instance for such a decision.\u201d*\n- Team composition (please add forum tags from team communicators): only applicable for organizations.\n\nAs a final note, it is worth mentioning that we rely on the good faith of participants regarding COI Disclosure and urge them to keep this information as up-to-date as possible so that if a new conflict arises, both the Program Administrator and the DAO can be aware of it.\n\n**Note:**\u00a0*Any delegate who chooses to withdraw from the program can indicate their intention to opt out by posting a message in the forum.*\n\n## **Specific Parameters Breakdown**\n\n### **Maximum Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\nWe will maintain this parameter at 50 delegates.\n\n### Tiers and Rewards\n\nThe Tier determines the final Reward (USD). Since Rewards are being calculated in USD but paid in ARB, each tier has an ARB Cap.\n\n| **Tier** | **TP%** | **Min (USD)** | **Max (USD)** | **ARB Cap** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 90\u2013100% | $3,600 | $4,200 | 12,350 |\n| 2 | 75\u201390% | $2,500 | $3,000 | 8,800 |\n| 3 | 65\u201375% | $1,800 | $2,000 | 5,900 |\n| X | 50\u201365% | $1,000 | $1,500 | 4,400 |\n\n> The ARB Caps have been recalculated using 80% of the VWAP from the last 30 days at the time the Snapshot vote is published.\n> \n> \n> **Note: The ARB 30-day VWAP on July 31st is $0.425 therefore the 80% of the VWAP is $0.34 which is the price used to recalculate the ARB Caps.**\n> \n\nMonthly payments will be made using the last\u00a0**7-day VWAP**\u00a0on the day the transaction is submitted to the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n**Payments to delegates are expected to be processed in ARB from the Arbitrum Foundation Controlled Address between the 20th and the last day of each month.**\n\nPlease note that this is an estimated timeline intended as guidance and\u00a0**does not constitute a binding deadline**, as the actual payment date will depend on two factors:\n\n- The date on which the Program Manager submits the transaction to the Arbitrum Foundation.\n- OpSec/Compliance processes applicable to the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nIt is also important to consider that any new DIP Participants who become eligible for a reward for the first time will need to complete the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s Compliance process. As a result, disbursements in these cases may be delayed beyond the dates specified.\n\n### Proportional Adjusted Cap Method\n\n- Only the delegate with the highest score in each Tier receives the full cap.\n- The rest receive a reward proportional to their score.\n- This maintains meritocratic incentives within each Tier.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n\nARB Price = $0.20\nTheoretical Max Payout for Delegate 1 = $4,200 \u2192 21,000 ARB\nTier Cap = 15,700 ARB\nStep 1: Calculate the adjustment ratio\n![image](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d766ef77442292db5aac4c1876d699d11549ab8c.png)\nStep 2: Apply that ratio to all theoretical ARB payouts within the Tier\n\nExample with March Payments Batch 1:\n![image](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/438b735b117139fd3912d25d72ecf44c452013ae_2_557x500.jpeg)        \n![image](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e2f1e9a0ad1d5d58f9d9906b8b86e15a4c09e674_2_690x425.jpeg)\n        \n### **Scoring**\n\n**The minimum score to get a Reward is 50 Total Participation Points (TPP) for Tier X and 65 Total Participation Points (TPP) for Tier 3.**\n\nTo determine which delegates will receive monthly payments, we will continue using the\u00a0[dashboard](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation)\u00a0developed by Karma.\n\n**Note:**\u00a0*The program manager may adjust the scoring parameters without the need for a DAO Vote, provided they inform the DAO of the reasons for the changes.*\n\n### **Voting Participation**\n\n**1. Participation Rate (PR90) \u2013 Weight: 15 points**\n\nTracks delegate voting activity over the past 90 days to measure consistency in participation.\n\n**Formula**:\u00a0`(PR90 * 15) / 100`\n\n- **PR90**: The participation rate of the delegate over the last 90 days, expressed as a percentage.\n- **15**: Weight assigned to this parameter (15% of the total score).\n\n**Example**: If a delegate has a PR90 of 80%, their score for this metric is:\n\n`(80 * 15) / 100 = 12`\n\n**2. Snapshot Voting (SV) \u2013 Weight: 20 points**\n\nMeasures participation in voting on Snapshot proposals during the evaluation month.\n\n**Formula**:\u00a0`(SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) * 20`\n\n- **SV(Rn)**: The number of proposals the delegate voted on during the month.\n- **SV(Tn)**: The total number of proposals on Snapshot during the month.\n- **20**: Weight assigned to Snapshot voting (20% of the total score).\n\n**Example**: If a delegate votes on 8 out of 10 proposals, their score for this metric is:\n\n`(8 / 10) * 20 = 16`\n\n**3. Tally Voting (TV) \u2013 Weight: 25 points**\n\nMeasures on-chain voting participation using the Tally platform.\n\n**Formula**:\u00a0`(TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) * 25`\n\n- **TV(Rn)**: The number of on-chain proposals the delegate voted on during the month.\n- **TV(Tn)**: The total number of on-chain proposals during the month.\n- **25**: Weight assigned to on-chain voting (25% of the total score).\n\n**Example**: If a delegate votes on 9 out of 12 proposals, their score for this metric is:\n\n`(9 / 12) * 25 = 18.75`\n\n**4. Voting Power Multiplier (VPM)**\n\nA linear function that adjusts the scoring of the Voting Participation parameters by using a multiplier based on the Average Monthly VP of each Delegate.\n\n**Formula:**\u00a0`0.00000005063 * Delegate VP (monthly avg) + 0.7974685`\n\n- Minimum: 0.8 (for 50,000 VP)\n- Maximum: 1.0 (for 4,000,000+ VP)\n- Uses a weighted average of VP over the month.\n\n### **b. Forum Engagement and other Contributions**\n\n**1. DF (Delegate Feedback Score) - Weight: 40 points**\n\nAssesses the quality of a delegate\u2019s feedback using a rubric with five criteria (e.g., clarity, depth, relevance). Feedback is scored from 0 to 10 (0 is reserved for penalties), and the presence in discussions acts as a multiplier.\n\n**Formula**:\u00a0`(\u03a3 qualitative criteria / 50) * 40 * Multiplier`\n\n- **\u03a3 qualitative criteria**: The total score across the rubric (max: 50 points).\n- **/50**: Normalizes the rubric score to a percentage.\n- **40**: Weight assigned to Delegate Feedback\n- **Multiplier**: Based on the delegate\u2019s participation in discussions.\n\n**Example**: If a delegate scores 40/50 on the rubric and participates in 80% of discussions (multiplier = 1.2):\u00a0`(40 / 50) * 40 * 1.2 = 38.4`\n\n**2. Bonus Points (BP) \u2013 Extra 30 points**\n\nAwarded for exceptional contributions, such as attending governance calls.\n\n- **1.25% Bonus Points**\u00a0per Governance Report Call (GRC) attended.\n- **1.25% Bonus Points**\u00a0per Open Discussion of Proposals Governance Call attended.\n- **Max Bonus Points**\u00a0per month from attending calls\u00a0**is 5%.**\u00a0*The Program Manager reserves the right to make exceptional changes to this limit and to the specific calls to be rewarded.*\n\n| **Governance Activity** | **New Bonus** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Governance Report Call | 1.25% BP per call |\n| Open Discussion of Proposals Call | 1.25% BP per call |\n| **Max Bonus Cap** | **5% BP** |\n- The rest is reserved for extraordinary contributions.\n- **A DIP Participant can only get a total of 30 points between both concepts.**\n\n### **Parameters Overview Table**\n\n| **Metric** | **Weight** | **Formula** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Participation Rate (PR) | 15 | (PR90 * 15) / 100 |\n| Snapshot Voting (SV) | 20 | (SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) * 20 |\n| Tally Voting (TV) | 25 | (TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) * 25 |\n| Voting Power Multiplier (VPM) | 0.8 to 1 | 0.00000005063 * Delegate VP (monthly avg) + 0.7974685 |\n| Delegate Feedback (DF) | 40 | (\u03a3 rubric score / 50) * 40 * Multiplier |\n| Bonus Points (BP) | Extra | +30 TP |\n\n### Total Participation Points Calculation Steps\n\nIt combines all the aforementioned parameters to calculate the delegate\u2019s overall score and it follows these steps:\n\n1. Compute\u00a0**PR90, SV, and TV**\u00a0individually.\n2. Sum these and apply the\u00a0**Voting Power Multiplier (VPM)**: (PR90 + SV + TV) * VPM\n3. Add\u00a0**Delegate Feedback Score (DF)**.\n4. Add\u00a0**Bonus Points (BP)**\u00a0- (Max 5% of (PR90+SV+TV)*VPM+DF).\n5. Final result determines the\u00a0**delegate\u2019s performance or Total Participation score**\u00a0for compensation.\n\n**Formula**:\u00a0`(PR% + SV% + TV%) * VPM + DF% + BP`\n\n### Payment USD (PUSD) Calculation\n\nDetermines the monthly compensation in USD based on TP% and tier.\n\n**Formula**:`=MIN(4200, SI(TIER=X, 1000 + (TP-50)*(1500-1000)/(65-50), SI(TIER=3, 1800 + (TP-65)*(2000-1800)/(75-65), SI(TIER=2, 2500 + (TP-90)*(3000-2500)/(90-75), SI(TIER=1, 3600 + (4200-3600)/(100-90), 0)))))`\n\n- **TIER = X,3,2,1**: Compensation tiers based on Total Participation percentage.\n- **1000, 1800, 2500, 3600**: Minimum USD payments for tiers X, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.\n- **1500, 2000, 3000, 4200**: Maximum USD payments for tiers X, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.\n- **50, 65, 75, 90**: Minimum TP scores for tiers X, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.\n- **65, 75, 90, 100**: Maximum TP scores for tiers X, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.\n- (TP-50)(1500-1000)/(65-50)(TP-65)*(2000-1800)/(75-65)(TP-75)*(3000-2500)/(90-75)(TP-90)*(4200-3600)/(100-90)Scales payment based on delegate performance within each tier.\n\n### Payment ARB (PARB) Calculation\n\nConverts USD payment to ARB, capped by a tier-specific limit.\n\n**Formula**:`IF(PUSD/ARB Price > Tier Cap; Tier Cap; PUSD/ARB Price)`\n\n- **PUSD**: Delegate\u2019s final USD payment.\n- **ARB Price**: Last 7D ARB\u2019s VWAP based on Coingecko.\n- **Tier Cap**: Maximum ARB tokens for the delegate\u2019s tier.\n\nNote: Tier cap only applies if it\u2019s the best delegate of the Tier, see details about Adjusted Cap Method above.\n\n## Other Specifications\n\n### **Evaluation System for Delegates\u2019 Feedback**\n\n#### Rubric\n\nThe rubric assesses the valid feedback provided by the delegate throughout the month (from day 1 at 00:00 UTC to the last day of the month at 23:59:59 UTC), based on a summary of their participation in various proposals and discussions. The aim is to measure the consistency, quality, and overall impact of their contributions.\n\n- **Key point:**\u00a0Feedback or opinions that violate\u00a0[community rules](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidlines/12807)\u00a0or the DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions will not be considered. Your interactions should contribute constructively to the discussions and improvement of the proposals.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each criterion included in the rubric:\n\n- **Relevance:**\u00a0Analyzes whether the delegate\u2019s feedback throughout the month is relevant to the discussion.\n- **Depth of Analysis:**\u00a0It evaluates the depth of analysis provided by the delegate concerning the proposals or discussions. This serves as a metric to assess whether the delegate takes the time to thoroughly meditate on the discussion and demonstrates attention to the details. Key elements include solid arguments, relevant questions, and thorough reasoning.\n- **Timing:**\u00a0Considers when the delegate provides feedback, rewarding those who provide feedback earlier, as long as they provide a valid contribution. Note that this parameter may be adjusted to Relevance, Depth of Analysis, and Impact on Decision-making parameters.\n- **Clarity and Communication:**\u00a0This is a review of the clarity, structured communication, and overall readability of the delegate\u2019s feedback. Clear and well-written feedback is rewarded. Note that this parameter may be adjusted to Relevance, Depth of Analysis, and Impact on Decision-making parameters.\n- **Impact on Decision-Making:**\u00a0While the proposer ultimately decides whether to incorporate feedback, high-quality feedback from a delegate often influences the final proposal that goes to vote. This criterion evaluates whether the delegate\u2019s feedback tends to drive changes in proposals/discussions.\n- **Presence in Discussions:**\u00a0This is a more quantitative analysis, intended to reflect the effort of DIP Participants who engage in the most relevant discussions. This parameter serves as a multiplier to the score obtained across the previous five criteria.\u00a0*The Program Manager reserves the right to include their own set of Discussions for this parameter each month.*\n\n**1. Data Collection and filtering**: At the end of the month, the complete set of contributions by each DIP Participant across all discussions on the forum is reviewed and the Program Manager will consult with the different proposers/key stakeholders to determine whether or not to include contributions made in the forum.\n\nA criterion is established to determine when a comment is considered valid or invalid:\n\n1. Only comments with\u00a0**tangible impact**\u00a0(e.g., concrete changes in proposals) will be automatically considered.\n2. Contributions highlighted by proposers will also be valid. This includes pre-forum (draft) \u201cinvisible\u201d contributions, as previously mentioned in the Rationale.\n3. The Program Manager may also include outstanding contributions.\n4. Key stakeholders (**Contributors with \u2265500,000 ARB delegated**) may also publicly highlight or privately recommend a specific contribution to the Program Manager. The rationale behind this item is that if a specific comment from a Contributor had an impact on a Key Stakeholder with significant Voting Power, we can reasonably assert that such a contribution held value within the decision-making process.\n\n**Clarifications:**\n\n- The anonymity of those who propose valuable contributions under either of the two points above will be preserved.\n- Proposers or other key stakeholders must disclose to the Program Manager any CoI with the DIP Participant who has made the highlighted contribution.\n- The rubric will continue to be used to evaluate the contributions mentioned in points 1, 2, 3, and 4, so it is expected that, for example, a small change introduced to a proposal may carry more value than a significant one. This means the Program Manager will still have discretion to categorize and assess the contributions from points 1, 2, 3, and 4, although determining whether a comment is considered valid or invalid will no longer depend solely on the PM.\n- The Program Manager reserves the right to exclude any of the contributions from points 1, 2, 3, and 4 due to CoI or potential collusion.\n\n**2. Overall Evaluation:**\u00a0After gathering all contributions considered \u201cvalid\u201d for the month, a rubric is used to assess the delegate\u2019s overall performance on each criterion, based on a holistic view of their participation.\n\n**3. Score Assignment:**\u00a0A level of 1 to 5 is assigned to each criterion, based on the consistency and quality of the DIP Participant\u2019s contributions over the month. Each level has an assigned score, from 1 to 10. (0 is reserved for penalties)\n\n**4. Monthly Report:**\u00a0A qualitative and quantitative report summarizing the DIP Participant\u2019s performance over the month is then produced.\n\n### **Scoring Methodology**\n\nEach rubric criterion has levels with an assigned score, from 1 to 10, depending on the level achieved.\n\nThe initial score is obtained by adding the first five criteria, while the final score results from applying the \u201cPresence in Discussions\u201d multiplier to the initial average score. The maximum Initial Score is 50 points, and 40 points for the Final Score.\n\n### Exclusion of vote-buying platforms\n\nVote-buying platforms will be excluded from the Delegate Incentive Program, given that these platforms operate with their own economic incentives for how the Voting Power they acquire is used. The Program Manager reserves the right to revisit this decision if, in the future, the DAO gains greater clarity on the matter and finds it feasible to use the DIP as a mechanism for alignment with vote-buying platforms. This means that, if consensus is reached, pathways may be proposed to allow these platforms to participate in the program for the benefit of the DAO.\n\n### **Conflict resolution**\n\n### **Dispute**\n\nIf DIP Participants disagree with the results presented by the\u00a0[Karma Dashboard](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation)\u00a0at the beginning of each month, they have a four-day period to contest them.\n\nTo raise a dispute, delegates must post a message in the forum using the following template:\n\n- Title: Dispute\n- Reason for Dispute (provide details)\n\nThe DIP administrator will address the issue promptly, with a resolution expected within a maximum of 4 days.\n\n*Important clarifications:*\n\n- Only\u00a0**objective parameters**\u00a0like votes (PR90, Snapshot Voting, and Tally Voting), call attendance, and dashboard errors can be disputed.\n- Rubrics on DF and Bonus Points may receive feedback, but will not be altered. The Program Manager reserves the right to make amendments to the scoring of a DIP Participant after presenting the results.\n- DIP Participants can\u2019t dispute the scorings/assessments of other DIP Participants\n\n### **DIP Ban**\n\nThe program administrator will have the right to expel a delegate if they attempt to game or exploit the program or if the DIP Participant does not comply with the DIP\u2019s Terms and Conditions. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator. In all cases, the ban is permanent.\n\nThe affected DIP Participant may submit an appeal to the Arbitrum Foundation, which would act as a neutral mediator in the situation and have the authority to ratify, change, or revoke the Program Manager\u2019s decision.\n\n### **DIP Suspension**\n\nThe Program Manager will have the right to suspend a DIP Participant if commits a fault that, in the Program Manager\u2019s judgment, is insufficient cause for expulsion. The decision and duration of the suspension are at the discretion of the program administrator (duration can\u2019t exceed the program\u2019s current iteration).\n\nThe affected DIP Participant may submit an appeal to the Arbitrum Foundation, which would act as a neutral mediator in the situation and have the authority to ratify, change, or revoke the Program Manager\u2019s decision.\n\n### **DIP Scoring Penalty (New)**\n\nThe Program Manager will have the right to penalize a DIP Participant if commits a fault that, in the Program Manager\u2019s judgment, is insufficient cause for expulsion or suspension. The penalty could consist of allocating negative bonus points or marking a comment as valid with a score of 0 points to affect the average score in the Delegates\u2019 Feedback Parameter.\n\nThe affected DIP Participant may submit an appeal to the Arbitrum Foundation, which would act as a neutral mediator in the situation and have the authority to ratify, change, or revoke the Program Manager\u2019s decision.\n\n**In all cases (Ban, Suspension or Penalty), in the future and once OpCo is fully operational, responsibility for the resolution of conflicts\u00a0**can be**\u00a0transferred to the OpCo at the Program Manager\u2019s discretion. The Program Manager will acknowledge when this transfer can take place and make it public on the governance forum when it goes into effect.**\n\n### **Program Growth Clause**\n\nAt the moment of approving the 1.5 proposal, we had a Program Growth Clause that allowed the Program Manager to reopen discussions on the budget:\n\n![program growth clause.jpg](ipfs://bafkreihfwekuejpsxzp5wqzugqjc3kvf6s3moxdtqwwcys2rrsmfqg4fim)\n\nIn light of the increase in Eligible Participants, the addition of new responsibilities such as the formalization of our authority to determine cases of non-compliance with the Terms and Conditions / DAO Code of Conduct, and our commitment to carry out a Business Development effort to onboard new DIP Participants into the program, we propose a 25% increase in the Program Manager\u2019s compensation for the remaining four months.\n\n## **Management and development of the Delegate Incentives Program: Responsibilities and Deliverables**\n\nThe SEEDGov team and Karma will continue to collaborate to maintain and manage this new version of the DIP.\n\n### **Program Dashboard Management (Karma)**\n\nOver the past six months, our team has successfully built and maintained the DAO\u2019s compensation dashboard.

(5 months remaining at the time of writing this post)\n\n### **SEEDGov Details:**\n\n- 2 Program Administrators (2 Full-time): $169,000 over 12 months.\n- 1 Data Analyst (Part-Time): $35,000 over 12 months.\n\n**Total:**\u00a0$204,000 ($16,000 per month from November to July and $20,000 from August to October) (4 months remaining at the time of writing this post)\n\n## **KPIs**\n\nWith the DAO\u2019s shifting priorities and reduced operational burden for delegates, we believe the original goals may no longer be fully aligned with the current context. It\u2019s important to note that this proposal was approved nearly 9 months ago, and naturally, in a fast-moving environment like crypto, some expectations become outdated.\n\nThe program naturally has two main objectives today:\n\n1. To support the DAO in achieving quorum, particularly for constitutional votes. It is a fact that a significant number of stakeholders require these incentives to justify the time they dedicate to reviewing proposals and voting with proper due diligence.\n2. To serve as a pipeline that supports external contributors who are interested in making valuable contributions and are looking to find their place within the DAO. In this way, the DIP has been functioning as a framework that attracts and retains talent within the Arbitrum ecosystem, especially when it comes to stakeholders with smaller amounts of delegated ARB.\n\nConsidering this, we propose the following KPIs for the remaining months:\n\n- Currently, there are approximately 65 Contributors with \u2265500,000 ARB delegated, of which 21 (115M VP approximately) are actively participating in the DIP. These 21 DIP Participants currently maintain an average Participation Rate of 85% in on-chain proposals. Since there is limited room for further improvement in terms of DIP Participants\u2019 Participation Rate, one of the objectives will be to retain these DIP Participants, maintain the current average, and ideally increase it to 90%.\n- Where there is indeed room for improvement is in the number of Contributors with \u2265500,000 ARB delegated participating in the program. Currently, there are 35 out of the 65 Contributors with \u2265500,000 ARB whose Participation Rate is below 75% (they have an average historical Participation Rate of 19.73%), and together they account for approximately 107M ARB in Voting Power.\nWe will undertake a\u00a0**Business Development effort**\u00a0focused on onboarding to the program those Contributors who are above the threshold but are not yet participating.\nWith the introduction of the new\u00a0**Tier X**, we believe it will be easier to onboard these stakeholders by encouraging them to dedicate time to reviewing and voting on proposals with proper due diligence, in exchange for a reward.\nTherefore, we aim to\u00a0**onboard at least 5 of these Contributors with 500K or more VP, ideally 10 or its equivalent in Voting Power.**\n- Increase the ARB per USD Spent metric by 30% compared to last quarter: This means that the program will aim for greater efficiency when incentivizing Voting Activities, seeking to maximize the amount of ARB actively voting per dollar spent.\n- Identify at least 5 contributors who can add value in specific verticals: So far, the DIP has demonstrated some success in attracting, identifying, and guiding contributors \u2014 especially those with lower VP \u2014 to deliver value within specific verticals.\n\n## **Continuous Upgrades**\n\nThe SEEDGov team and Karma are committed to gathering feedback, obtaining more information, and implementing the necessary changes to optimize performance.

Their application was very thorough in describing their execution strategy, goals, milestones, and KPIs. They had a good emphasis on attempting to attract new users and deposits to Arbitrum using their existing user base.\nTheir requested grant size is very large given their age and protocol usage. Typically we would be against such a request however, they have provided performance-based milestones to unlock further tranches of their grant.\nThe other concern is that they currently have no audit (one is being completed with ottersec).\nUltimately, we think that Pike brings new and novel infrastructure to Arbitrum making it easier to connect with users across different chains. It will allow collateral to stay on Arbitrum while users explore other chains; and vice versa. Therefore, we feel like it\u2019s ultimately the DAO\u2019s decision as to whether or not they want to take a risk on the potential long-term benefits of Pike. We will support this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis was a strong proposal in most areas other than request size and audits (which are still ongoing). Given the clear execution strategy, milestones, and metrics to proceed with the grant plan, Pike was able to overcome the softer scores in those areas of the rubric. We recommend approving this grant.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nWhile the product offering seems compelling, I question the size of the requested ARB and the ability for Pike to deliver on their aspirational goals relative to the size of the ask. If Pike were to lower their ask, I would be more receptive to their application. The Pike Protocol is aiming to bring cross-chain lending to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, they are in a capped launch at the moment, the product has yet to prove that it has significant demand for cross-chain lending/borrowing. They have stiff competition with native borrowing/lending platforms that are native to Arbitrum including Radiant. Their grant request has a wide range but overall I think it is too expensive and I fear when the incentives dry up so will the TVL gathered from the protocol. It would be better if they had a firm lower ask to test if their protocol gathered significant traction and then come back to the DAO for a large ask at a later time. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Pike's proposal.\n\nComprehensive proposal that scored well across the rubric with a detailed execution plan, milestones, and with a lens to maintaining stickiness throughout LTIPP. While this is a very large (ranged) grant size request in contrast to their life, the protocol has seen strong adoption across TVL and users, and the grant unlocked will be conditional upon the achievement of milestones which reduces risk.

Clipper\u2019s original LTIPP proposal for 249,004 ARB included components for Liquidity Mining and incentives for Clipper User Migration to Arbitrum. This proposal was rejected in a 3-2 decision. The judges highlighted three areas where Clipper\u2019s application could be improved:\n\n* Three expressed concern that the requested liquidity mining grant size is too large relative to Clipper\u2019s current TVL.\n* Three said the execution plan/milestones is sparse.\n* One said the data seems hard to believe, and think the applicant conflates an address with being a unique user.\n\nClipper has made revisions to the initial proposal:\n\n* Amended the application to 174,308 ARB from 249,004 ARB\n* In particular, Clipper decreased the liquidity mining component request by 40%, to 74,308 ARB from 123,846 ARB\n* Added specific milestones for each component including specifically user acquisition targets\n\nApplication Revisions have been posted to the Arbitrum forum:\n\n* https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clipper-ltipp-application-draft/21726/5\n\nLink to Original Application\n\n* [ https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clipper-ltipp-application-draft/21726/5 ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clipper-ltipp-application-draft/21726/5)\n\n### Milestones\n\nPer the judge\u2019s feedback, Clipper has enhanced its execution plan and added monthly milestones to improve accountability.\n\nLiquidity Farming\n\nTotal Duration: 12 weeks (10 weeks + 2 weeks setup)\n\nTimeline: Once the grant is received, the team will need 2 weeks (maximum) to deploy and fund the farming pool contract on Arbitrum.

This goes as far back as 1990 when Phil Zimmerman released Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), one of the first openly available public-key cryptography applications that featured end-to-end (E2E) encryption. Zimmerman\u2019s creation prompted a criminal investigation that was eventually dropped, resulting in federal court decisions that protect encryption under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment. This clash on personal privacy became dubbed the \u201cencryption wars.\u201d\n\nOur team over at Axis Advisory has published a write-up that offers contextual information in relation to the above: Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom 4\n\nIn this regard, we are proposing a contribution from the ArbitrumDAO to DEF & CoinCenter to continue their policy & litigation efforts in relation to privacy-enhancement tooling and software developer advocacy. Some of the institutions\u2019 most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\nCOIN CENTER\n\nCoin Center\u2019s case against the Office of Foreign Assets Control about adding Tornado Cash to the OFAC Sanction List, (naturally, Tornado Cash not being a person or entity but a mere set of open-source smart contracts running on the Ethereum Blockchain). Albeit the court ruling against Coin Center in the initial proceedings, Coin Center is currently in the process of appealing the judgment.\n[Refer: Coin Center is suing OFAC over its Tornado Cash sanction].\n\n[Refer: https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304.74.0.pdf];\n\nCoin Center\u2019s concerns raised to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regarding the designation of convertible virtual currency (CVC) mixing as a primary money laundering concern (PMLC). In this regard, Coin Center highlighted the rule\u2019s extensive scope and lack of precedent. They argued that the proposed designation lacks clarity and narrowly tailored definitions, potentially leading to the misclassification of legitimate transactions as criminal.\n[Refer: Comments to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on \u201cProposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing, as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering Concern\u201d]\n\nCoin Center\u2019s letter to the Senate Finance Committee highlighing the need for a regulatory approach that mirrors the successful, light-touch framework applied to the internet. Coin Center advocated for clear taxation guidelines on cryptocurrency transactions, emphasizing the importance of a de minimis exemption for minor gains from every transaction to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies in daily commerce without undue tax burdens.\n[Refer: Coin Center Suggestions to Address Uncertain Tax Treatment of Digital Assets]\n\nCoin Center\u2019s contributions to Roman Storm\u2019s and Alexey Pertsev\u2019s legal defensen in relation to the following:\nRoman Storm\u2019s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of conspiracy to facilitate money laundering, operate an unlicensed money transmitter and violating sanctions [Court of New York]; and\nAlexey Pertsev\u2019s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of facilitating money laundering [Netherlands Court].\nDEFI EDUCATION FUND\n\nSome of the DeFi Education Fund\u2019s most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund initiated a legal challenge against a patent held by True Return Systems, LLC regarding blockchain technology, challenging the novelty and validity of its claims. This action reflects DEF\u2019s commitment to preserve the digital assets space\u2019s core values: fostering innovation, ensuring open access, and maintaining an inclusive environment. By contesting what DEF consider to be an overly broad patent, they aim to prevent potential monopolistic control, ensuring the decentralization is not compromised.\n[Refer: https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf].\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund filed a legal complaint along with Beba LLC against the SEC, after they recently created and distributed their \u2018BEBA token\u2019 via airdrops. Beba and DEF are seeking legal relief due to concerns that the SEC may classify BEBA tokens as securities, which could end up hindering not only their business operations but also the broader digital asset market. In essence, the DEF are fighting against the SEC\u2019s approach towards digital assets which has become overly broad without adequate rule-making procedures, stifling innovation.\n[Refer: https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_3f7a8f2ca6614d7381122cb1beeed4a8.pdf].\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund submitted an amicus brief in support of James Harper against the IRS, advocating for the Fourth Amendment rights of cryptocurrency users. DEF emphasizes the need to balance law enforcement\u2019s reach with individual\u2019s financial privacy in the digital realm. They are arguing for a modern interpretation of privacy protections to reflect the realities of digital transactions and the traceability of cryptocurrency activities on public ledgers.\n[Refer: DeFi Education Fund Files Amicus Brief In Coinbase Case].\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund also contributed to the support of Roman Storm\u2019s legal defense arguing against the novel legal theories proposed by the government under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and money laundering statutes. DEF emphasizes the importance of distinguishing software developers from the actions of third-party users, in order to protect software developers from being held liability for third-party misuse of their open-source.\n[Refer: https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_063f9d1fd563466cadfa3f5434f918e9.pdf].\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nCoin Center Contribution\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to Coin Center; the leading non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies.\n\nBy way of a brief; Coin Center\u2019s mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code \u2013 to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately.\n\nCoin Center has been at the forefront of policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties of software developers and other stakeholders within the industry.\n\nDeFi Education Fund Contribution\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to the DEF whose mission revolves around educating policymakers globally about DeFi, promoting grassroots supports, enhancing legal support across jurisdictions, and advocating for policies welcoming of decentralized financial infrastructure.\n\nThey have initiated several key projects and grants to advance its objectives. One of their initial endeavors targeted a group of organizations and individuals, with the goal of expanding the understanding of decentralization and the DeFi ecosystem among policymakers.\n\nAdditionally, the DEF is taking a stand against how some governments interpret laws in a way that could establish a troubling precedent, potentially discouraging software developers in various fields. They pointed out the risk that developers might face legal action for their open-source code if it is misused by other for illegal activities. This could place developers are risk of being held criminally responsible for actions they didn\u2019t partake in, possibly affecting them years or even decades later.\n\nPlease review the attached forum post for the full proposal and discussion.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "2910c0a7-ecfc-4efe-b85b-352655d3aea3", "proposal_id": "218a7ce5-c967-4397-8c4f-38f7eb17f3fb", "snapshot_id": "0xb41324ddcc115d08149b192e0b8ae4cfad0ef39cecb5663ea63d8a460d2cb3cc", "title": "[CONSTITUTIONAL] AIP: Security Council Election Process Improvements", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb41324ddcc115d08149b192e0b8ae4cfad0ef39cecb5663ea63d8a460d2cb3cc", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-09-04 22:11:23", "voting_end": "2025-09-11 22:11:23", "options": {"scores": [154103195.11987847, 120482661.02242488, 72507725.05213322, 77540738.27511047, 142264133.48603645, 16658066.281313542], "choices": ["Increase cohort duration", "Reduce qualification threshold", "Allow members to bypass Nominee", "Allow candidates to rotate keys", "Allow members to rotate keys", "None"]}, "last_activity": "2025-09-11 22:11:23", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:58.806", "body": "# Constitutional AIP\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis constitutional proposal focuses on updating the Security Council election process alongside the necessary changes to the ArbitrumDAO constitution. \n\nWe propose the following changes:\n\n- **Increase cohort durations**. Extend the Security Council cohort duration from 1 year to 2 years, therefore reducing election frequency from twice a year to once a year.\n\n- **Reduce qualification thresholds**. In the Nominee Selection phase, change the qualifying threshold from 0.2% to 0.1% of votable ARB.\n\n- **Progress Security Council members**. Allow any existing Security Council members who have re-applied to bypass the Nominee Selection phase and into the Member Election phase.\n\n- **Security Council key rotation**. Enable Security Council candidates to rotate their keys during the Compliance phase of the election and enable Security Council members to rotate their keys at any time during their term.\n\n- **Update Constitution Text**. All changes should be reflected in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to ensure the implementation adheres to the text.\n\nAs these changes are independent of one another (apart from the corresponding text changes to the constitution), this temperature check will use \u2018approval voting\u2019 to enable delegates to express support for each individual change (with their full voting power going towards each choice they select).\n\n# Motivation/Rationale\n\nThis AIP aims to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and practicality of the Security Council election process (for both candidates and delegates); while addressing the following pain points identified in recent cycles:\n\n- **Frequent election cycles**. Both voter and candidate fatigue from participating in the election every six months as a single election requires significant effort from all parties from advertising the election, getting candidates to nominate themselves, evaluating their candidacy, and ultimately picking them.\n\n- **Qualification threshold increasing**. A rising qualification threshold has reduced the number of candidates who can progress to the Member Election phase simply due to the unavailability of active voting power.\n\n- **Non-Emergency Actions to Rotate Keys**. Candidates, and existing Security Council members, cannot rotate their keys after they have registered for the election. This has led to the Security Council performing non-emergency actions to update their keys after the election has concluded. Not only is there increased risk due to suboptimal setups, but the additional burden on the Security Council is unnecessary.\n\n- **Renominating Security Council members**. It requires active voting power to progress an existing Security Council member to the Member Election phase. As they were already elected previously and vetted by the community, we can alleviate voting power pressure by automatically progressing any existing Security Council members who register for the new election.\n\n# Proposed Smart Contract Changes\n\nWe have implemented several new functions in the smart contract suite to facilitate the changes.\n\n### Set Cadence for Elections\n- *setCadence(numberOfMonths)*\n\nThis new function allows for the cadence of elections to be updated in the future by simply calling a setter function. It will be implemented within the [Nominee Election Governor](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8a1cDA8dee421cD06023470608605934c16A05a0#code) contract. We plan to initialise it with the value of \u201812\u2019 to represent 1 year and a future vote by the DAO can change its value. This would extend the March 2025 Security Council\u2019s cohort duration from 1 year to 1.5 years and extend all future Security Council cohort durations (including the September 2025 Security Council cohort) from 1 year to 2 years. This would also result in all future elections being held each September.\n\n### Reduce qualification threshold\n- *updateQuorumNumerator(newQuorumNumerator)*\n\nThis [function](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8a1cDA8dee421cD06023470608605934c16A05a0#writeProxyContract) already exists in the [Nominee Election Governor](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8a1cDA8dee421cD06023470608605934c16A05a0#code) contract. We plan to set a new value of \u201810\u2019 to represent 0.1% of votable ARB and thus adjusting it from 0.2% to 0.1%.\n\n### Bypass Nomination Phase\n- *addContender(proposalId, signature)*\n\nThis [function](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8a1cDA8dee421cD06023470608605934c16A05a0#writeProxyContract) will be modified to check if the address that is applying for the election is already an existing Security Council member from the cohort that is due to conclude. If the address is found, then this address will automatically be added as a candidate for the Member Election and go straight to the Compliance phase. The addContender function is implemented within the [Nominee Election Governor](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8a1cDA8dee421cD06023470608605934c16A05a0#code) contract.\n\n### Rotate Candidate\u2019s Security Council Key during election\n- *rotateNominee(proposalId, newNomineeAddress, signature)*\n\nThis new function allows candidates to rotate their key prior to the completion of the compliance stage and before the Member Election phase. It will be implemented within the [Nominee Election Governor](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8a1cDA8dee421cD06023470608605934c16A05a0#code) contract. Additionally, there is a special condition, such that they can only rotate their keys at least 3 days before the Compliance Process ends. The Arbitrum Foundation will monitor for key rotations.\n\n### Rotate Member\u2019s Security Council Key during term\n- *rotateMember(newMemberAddress, memberElectionGovernor, signature)*\n\nThis new function allows a Security Council member to self-rotate their keys during their term. It will be implemented within the [Security Council Manager](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xD509E5f5aEe2A205F554f36E8a7d56094494eDFC#code) contract. The new rotateMember function will replace the existing [rotateMember](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xD509E5f5aEe2A205F554f36E8a7d56094494eDFC#writeProxyContract) function (which is redundant as it has the same functionality as the existing [replaceMember](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xD509E5f5aEe2A205F554f36E8a7d56094494eDFC#writeProxyContract) function). The execution of a rotation will be subject to the full governance time lock of 18 days before they are registered into the Security Council multisigs on Arbitrum One, Ethereum, and Arbitrum Nova. The Arbitrum Foundation will monitor for key rotations.\n\nNote, this code change has already been [written](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/322), tested, and partially [audited](https://docs.arbitrum.io/assets/files/2025-03-offchain-security-council-rotation-securityreview-6feca69ad7afe171104ecabaefe8971a.pdf) in March 2025, with an additional full audit in process.\n\n### Changes to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution\nWe have put together proposed changes to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution in [Section 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-3-the-security-council) and [Section 4](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections) to reflect these changes to the Security Council election process; as well as a minor correction in [Section 2](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-2-dao-proposals-and-voting-procedures) to reflect current governance practices. All these proposed text changes can be found in the [Changes to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-security-council-election-process-improvements/29848#p-73316-changes-to-the-arbitrumdao-constitution-10) section of the proposal\u2019s forum post.\n\n# Timeline\n\nConsidering that the next Security Council election (for the September 2025 cohort), will commence in mid-September, this proposal would only go to an onchain vote after the respective election is complete. However, the Foundation wants to make the DAO, current Security Council members, and future Security Council candidates aware of the potential changes that might soon take place (if approved by the DAO), and will therefore aim to raise this to Snapshot before the September 2025 cohort\u2019s election process starts.\n\nIf this proposal were to pass, it would retroactively apply to both the March 2025 and September 2025 cohorts, as well as to any future cohorts. This would also mean that the election following the September 2025 election would be held in September 2026, to replace the current March 2025 cohort. Those who applied for the recently elected March 2025 Security Council cohort, agreed to this hypothetical term extension in their declarations, while those who will apply to the forthcoming September 2025 Security Council cohort will need to agree to this hypothetical term extension in their declarations.\n\nThe following timeline outlines proposed milestones from initial discussions to full implementation. Adjustments may be made based on community feedback and DAO governance requirements.\n\n1. August 20, 2025 (complete)\u2192 AIP forum post outlining the proposed changes to the Security Council election process.\n\n2. August 20, 2025 - September 2025 (ongoing)\u2192 Full audit of proposed changes. Any further changes will be re-audited ahead of a potential Tally vote.\n\n3. September 4, 2025 \u2192 Temperature check held on Snapshot.\n\n4. November 2025 \u2192 Onchain Tally vote will commence following the September 2025 Security Council election.\n\n\n# Voting Options\n\nAs all the proposed changes to the Security Council election process are independent of one another (apart from the corresponding text changes to the constitution), this temperature check will use \u2018*[approval voting](https://docs.snapshot.box/proposals/voting-types#approval-voting)*\u2019 to better understand sentiment regarding each individual change before deciding how to proceed with the vote.\n\nWith approval voting, each delegate may select any number of choices, and each selected choice will receive the delegate\u2019s full voting power. As a reminder, if a delegate does not support any of the proposed changes, they should only select \u2018*None*\u2019 to ensure reliability of results.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "29470f0e-6236-45cb-9f3d-f998d71e83dc", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xc02a8620e55e38c2596f419df965d69701b395d8aeff492a3bced32e4c1d77cb", "title": "QiDao STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x79C4213a328E3B4F1D87b4953C14759399dB25E2", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc02a8620e55e38c2596f419df965d69701b395d8aeff492a3bced32e4c1d77cb", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [23066766.65168315, 23831724.20503021, 74579615.24231617], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.293", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

They scored well in reach, activity, age, composability, and novelty. In contrast, the application lacked specifics regarding how they plan to incentivizing users in game and why such mechanisms are relevant (execution strategy).\nThey also lost some points due to allocating 50k (\u2153 of their grant request) to marketing campaigns, which leads to the ARB not reaching the hands of users and lacks the ability for oversight. However, they have been very open in reporting data for their marketing initiatives.\nOverall, we plan to support this proposal and think it offers the DAO a good opportunity to learn from ARB being spent on marketing efforts. The team has clearly shown their ability to attract users, so we think it\u2019s worth it for the DAO to vote on whether or not they want to support this type of grant.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe grant plan demonstrates existing and growing usage (as measured by DAUs). The plan is also tailored to build on existing growth by specifically targeting segments of gamer population on other chains and in the audience of web2 gamer influencers. The total amount requested seems appropriate for the ambitious milestones and the plan of attack laid out. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n\nKuroro shows promising potential, supported by a robust protocol performance since their game launch. The proposed funding aims to facilitate the integration of gamers from diverse ecosystems such as Immutable, Solana, and Ronin.

Kuroro pledges to match incentives and utilize the funds to achieve their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) However, a notable portion of the grant is allocated to marketing, which might not directly benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.

The funds will enable the evaluation committee to fund a set of exceptional applications that were excluded due to budget constraints.\n* The committee has provided the list of applicants that it strongly recommends deserve to be funded as part of the Sprint, in addition to the 5M ARB already [allocated](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sprint-results-announcing-the-accepted-applications/28294). Rationale and a summary of the applicants is linked in the proposal.\n* We will be moving this request to **Snapshot next Thursday, February 6th**. If approved, an onchain vote will move forward the following Thursday as to not further disrupt the proposed timelines of the applicants.\n\n## Motivation/Rationale\n\nWith 147 applications and ~31.92 million ARB in funding requests, demand for the Stylus Sprint program significantly exceeded expectations. The committee received a large number of exceptional applications, but unfortunately, due to the initial budget constraints, the committee was only able to fund 17 applications. They were chosen based on a combination of factors including cost, timeline, necessity for immediate start, RFP category importance, and the priority to fund both applications and infrastructure/tooling.\n\nWhile the committee has [accepted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sprint-results-announcing-the-accepted-applications/28294) a subset of the applicants, there remains an important opportunity to support impactful ideas and high-quality teams. With Stylus as one of Arbitrum\u2019s strongest competitive advantages, the committee strongly believes that enabling all impressive applications received as a part of the Stylus Sprint with funding is a worthwhile investment for the DAO.\n\nThis proposal seeks an additional allocation of 4 million ARB tokens to extend funding opportunities to promising projects that were not initially accepted into the Sprint. With this budget extension, the committee will be able to fund an additional group of applicants, outlined in detail below. While there are many more strong applications, the recommended list scored especially high during the review process and are ones that the committee is confident have the potential to provide value to the Arbitrum and Stylus ecosystems.\n\n## Specifications\n\nAs stated in the original Stylus Sprint proposal, large requests may be directed to the DAO directly to request funding. This process was communicated to applicants, some of which elected to go this route over reducing their request. The smaller applicants in this list are in the committee\u2019s opinion worthwhile investments that have the potential to improve Stylus long-term.\n\nThe following list of applicants are the ones that come with a strong recommendation from the committee and to reiterate were unable to be accepted due to budget constraints.\n\nOpen Application\n\n1.

The committee is aware of some applicants that may bring revised versions and/or lower budgets than when they were originally reviewed. While we appreciate that Arbitrum DAO\u2019s open and decentralized essence provides the freedom to make such requests, we\u2019d encourage delegates to be mindful of the possible precedent funding projects circumventing the program would set. When appropriate, the committee has already directed certain applications to be on the look out for alternative DAO programs, such as the Season 3 of [Arbitrum D.A.O](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-rfc-arbitrum-d-a-o-domain-allocator-offerings-grant-program-season-3/27584) program if it's approved.\n\nIf this proposed extension is approved on Snapshot, we will move it immediately to an onchain vote the following Thursday, February 20th. The recommended applicants will be held to the current Stylus Sprint timeline, so the committee would like to not unnecessarily delay the ability to fund these projects. Projects funded as part of the Stylus Sprint\u2019s budget increase will benefit from the infrastructure already in place as far as MSS/payments and milestone reviews by the evaluation committee.\n\nThe Snapshot vote will be a basic vote with For, Against, and Abstain as options.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe Stylus Sprint committee is requesting an **additional 4,000,000 ARB** to extend its Stylus Sprint budget.

This new version will try to implement significant changes that we believe are going to improve the actual version of the system.\n\nConsidering that the actual program concludes on August 31, that the following iteration will probably need more than one week of discussion, and that we adapt to the recent approved [DAO Calendar](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x249a8e8aef5dc59da18b72e7d14ace5197ec6242675ab7f82b3d3f17f71bb13b), we are presenting a temporary extension of the program with the objective of not interrupting delegates incentives while v1.1 is being discussed.\n\n### Rationale\n\nApproved Delegate Incentive System has proved to be cost-efficient. To date, 1,1 million ARBs are still in the DIS multisig out of a total of 1.58M initially transferred.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifai7old2hjql4pdjats5fgpy5zhqi6lvoipbd6twrekvg647pmqu)\n    \nNote I: *Special thanks to our frens [@r3gen_Finance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/r3gen_finance/summary) for an early delivery of their Arbitrum Token Flow Report. The Full Flow Report will be published soon.*\n\nNote II: *Data as of July 31, 2024*.\n\nWith the objective of maintaining the delegates engaged and incentivized while v1.1 of the system is discussed, we propose to extend the current one for a period up to two months.\n\nThis proposal will be attached to the new Delegate Incentive System. If the new version of the system is approved before the temporary extension ends, this version will be deprecated to make way for v1.1 of the System.\n\n### Costs:\n\nAs an important clarification, cost structures won\u2019t be changed during this temporary extension. Funds will come from the [Delegate Incentive System Multisig](https://www.arbwallets.xyz/).\n\n- Monthly Delegates Incentives: TBD (Average Monthly ARB incentives: 108,7k)\n- Karma Administration Costs: 3750 ARB per month.\n- SEEDGov Administration Costs: 3.333 ARB per month.\n- Multisig Administration Costs: 5.000 ARB per month.\n\nNote: *We know that costs are out of date.

We\u2019ve gathered feedback about how we can improve our support for Arbitrum through many conversations over the past year with DAO stakeholders including delegates, contributors, and Foundation representatives. We propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by researching specifications for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n## Motivation\n\nArbitrum is the largest and most decentralized DAO in the world. Tally is highly invested in the success of both the Arbitrum DAO specifically and the Arbitrum community as a whole. We have a strong track record as an Arbitrum governance service provider, [ecosystem builder](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tally-final-stip-round-1/17557), and [delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth). Tally continuously ships improvements for the Arbitrum DAO, including [transfer actions](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1732425795262714363?s=20), [improved Safe support](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1714647532423561257?s=20), [proposal collaboration](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1743325532786168149?s=20), and the [nominee selection stage](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-changes-to-the-constitution-and-the-security-council-election-process/20856/9?u=frisson) of Security Council elections. This proposal would enable us to invest more resources into the Arbitrum DAO and scale up our impact.\n\nThe majority of the improvements outlined in this proposal are specific to Arbitrum's unique implementation of onchain governance and will not be re-used in other DAOs. We are long-term partners to the Arbitrum DAO who plan to continue investing specifically in making Arbitrum governance great. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive, technically inclusive, and user-focused. Our proposed improvements make it easier for contributors of all backgrounds and technical abilities to engage with Arbitrum governance.\n\n## Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\nWe propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by developing a specification for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n**Improve the proposal process** \n*Watch a demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yORl1yZPt7Q) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Link forum proposal posts and Tally proposals so that delegates can create Tally proposals from forum posts, see forum proposal comments directly on Tally, and be updated by a Tally Discourse bot when onchain proposals are created.\n  * In order to show posts on the proposal page, Tally would need [Embedding permission](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-discourse-comments-on-another-website-via-javascript/31963)\n  * In order to post \"this proposal is now onchain (link)\", the Tally Discourse bot would need an API key with topics.writepermission from https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/admin/api/keys/new\n* Build a diff checker into Tally proposals that shows what text has changed from Snapshot without having to click back over to Snapshot, to help delegates understand any relevant changes from the temp check phase to the onchain governance phase.\n* Enable cancel functionality on Tally proposals so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes. (see upgrade Governor contracts section)\n* Develop full proposal execution integration by dynamically showing [each phase of proposal execution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal#the-lifecycle-of-an-arbitrum-improvement-proposal) with accurate time stamps so that contributors and delegates can easily manage proposals through the execution process.\n* Improve support for [late quorum extension](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#late-quorum-extension) on Tally so onchain proposals are automatically extended on Tally when late quorum extension is triggered.\n* Fully integrate the [quorum of each Governor](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-faqs#what-determines-the-quorum-minimum-votes-required-for-a-governance-proposal) throughout Tally, including on the proposal page and the delegates page so that delegates always know exactly how much voting power is required to reach quorum.\n* Show [Security Council](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council#the-role-of-the-security-council) transactions on the main [Arbitrum DAO page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) on Tally so the DAO can easily view actions taken by the Security Council.\n\n**Upgrade Governor contracts**\n*We\u2019re planning to partner with [Scopelift](https://scopelift.co/) to implement the upgrades. Scopelift is the developer of Flexible Voting and has deep experience with high-value governance contract upgrades.*\n\n* Add a [cancel() function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/92ff025622cdf6694318fc11af1c995236793a77/contracts/governance/Governor.sol#L455-L473) to the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s implementation of OpenZeppelin Governor so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes.\n* Add [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) to the Arbitrum DAO Governors to enable future innovations like voting from Orbit chains, voting from DeFi contracts, and shielded voting.\n\n**Highlight delegate contributions**\n*Watch a demo video [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WY1jQ2tP70U) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience.

Grant size is sized well when taking into account the moderate traction they've seen to-date. Milestones/KPIs are lofty to ~4x+ TVL and 3.5x their DAU throughout span of the LTIPP. Agreed with Wintermute's comments on effects being driven to their app-chain which is built on OP Stack. Given this and their differentiation at the product and end user experience level vs. other perp DEXs on Arbitrum, don't think this meaningfully contributes to supporting Arbitrum's competitive position in the market.\"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal submitted by Orderly Network is comprehensive, revealing a well-thought-out strategy for achieving growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their clear roadmap, detailed execution plan, and specific KPIs demonstrate a commitment to achieving tangible results. By offering competitive APRs and incentivizing user participation in various products such as Deposit Vaults, Quantum Pools, and Algo Trading Tools, Orderly aims to attract new users and increase TVL on Arbitrum significantly. The proposed grant will enable them to implement these initiatives effectively, ultimately driving adoption of Arbitrum among diverse user segments and enhancing the overall ecosystem's vitality. We would be supporting the proposal. \n\n*404 Feedback)*\nOrderly Network presented a very complete application and they have seen impressive growth over since launch. Overall, they had detailed milestones with trackable success metrics, detailed KPIs, and a clear execution strategy.

The protocol demonstrates extensive experience in utilizing incentives, as evidenced by their successful implementation with Moonbeam. Their goal of achieving a TVL of $10 million aligns well with their proposed grant amount and appears to be quite feasible. Of particular significance is their strategy to attract users from other ecosystems to Arbitrum, leveraging the same approach that proved effective with Moonbeam. Additionally, they plan to utilize the Prime Points community program to efficiently distribute incentives, further bolstering user adoption on Arbitrum.\n\nThe Prime Protocol introduces a compelling concept whereby users can borrow against their liquidity on any chain, facilitating cross-chain liquidity utilization. For instance, users could borrow against their BNB holdings on a different network and access USDC on Arbitrum. This design has the potential to broaden Arbitrum's liquidity base by tapping into external ecosystems while providing users with exposure to Arbitrum's low-cost environment.

Arbitrum Strategic Objective Setting (SOS) is an initiative through which DAO members will be able to propose and vote on a cohesive set of short- to mid-term objectives in a collective, inclusive, and adaptable way.\n\nThrough the SOS, any contributor can submit a set of short-term (1-year) and mid-term (2-year) objectives and related tangible key results for the DAO. The set of objectives should directly drive the DAO closer to reaching its vision, and align with the mission and purpose, as listed in the MVP proposal. The DAO will then vote on the proposed sets of objectives to select a single collection for implementation.\n\nEvery 12 months, the chosen objective set will be reviewed and, if needed, revised based on changing market conditions, the competitive environment, progress made in the past year, etc. In order to keep the DAO up to date with the progress towards each strategic objective, we suggest the research member of the ARDC be tasked with providing quarterly reports assessing how the DAO has improved through proposals and initiatives as well as suggesting what areas require more attention while recommending solutions to address these areas.\n\nOnce a set of objectives and related key results has been approved, Entropy will strive to build a budgeting framework where each high-level objective is allocated a certain amount of capital on a yearly basis, with interested contributors having the ability to request a share of this capital through a standardized structure. It\u2019s important to note that contributors will still maintain the ability to post standalone proposals outside of this structure and are not forced to tie their initiative to the MVP/SOS/budget framework. Having said that, as the established objectives should be regarded as one of the DAO\u2019s highest priorities, contributors should expect more friction when it comes to passing a proposal that doesn\u2019t reasonably demonstrate that it fits within the established short- to medium-term objectives. In other words, while the freedom to make proposals that fall outside the SOS will not cease to exist, we expect that the DAO will discourage it via the creation of a social contract among delegates.\n\n# Motivation & Rationale\n\nDiversity is undeniably one of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s strengths. We have hundreds of delegates from all around the world with varying perspectives, cultural behaviors, interests, incentives, etc. This is a double-edged sword, however, as it makes it more demanding to converge on unified goals and interim focus areas. The absence of concrete and agreed-upon goals today makes it challenging for the DAO to review progress and facilitate accountability, while it may be unclear to contributors what deliverables they should be prioritizing. Similar to the MVP proposal, the SOS takes inspiration from [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355)\u2019s approach to materializing short- and medium-term objectives for the DAO.\n\nBy establishing clear short- and mid-term strategic objectives and key results, the outcome of the SOS will serve as a roadmap that will bring cohesion and direction to the DAO\u2019s activities. This structured approach will enable the DAO to move beyond reactive governance and toward proactive strategic development. Having well-defined objectives allows the DAO to measure progress better, identify operational gaps, and adjust course when needed.\n\nThese objectives will create a shared foundation for evaluating opportunities across the DAO\u2019s diverse contributor base. When assessing new initiatives or responding to market developments, delegates and contributors will have tangible criteria to inform their choices. This alignment will help prevent the dilution of efforts that can occur in DAOs, ensuring collective resources and energy are directed towards Arbitrum\u2019s most important goals. A regular review cycle ensures the DAO\u2019s objectives remain responsive to changing conditions while maintaining momentum toward the mission, vision, and purpose. If the MVP helps to define the DAO\u2019s long-term vision, then the SOS allows Arbitrum DAO to chart the course to get there.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThis proposal can be considered to have two distinct phases. The first phase comprises a ~14-day forum review, feedback, and edit period after which the SOS framework will move to the 7-day offchain voting period. If passed, Entropy will consider the structure of the SOS accepted by the DAO, and the second phase will be initiated. In phase two, contributors will submit their strategic objectives matrices with one matrix finally chosen through a Snapshot vote. The periods making up the second phase are described below.\n\n## Notice Period (14 days)\n\nAt the beginning of the 14-day notice period, announcements will be made on the forum and all the other relevant communication channels (e.g., Twitter, Telegram, etc.), giving delegates and contributors enough time to prepare for the upcoming submission period. This announcement will include:\n\n1. The expected start and end dates of all the subsequent periods (submission, feedback, and revision).\n2. Guidelines on how to submit a proposed set of short- and medium-term objectives as well as related key results.\n3. Link to an open channel through which anyone can submit one-off objectives and related key results for consideration by those looking to develop a full-fledged objectives matrix submission.\n4. Link to an FAQ forum thread where delegates can ask questions about the program.\n\nEntropy Advisors will facilitate the end-to-end process in cooperation with the Arbitrum Foundation and any other relevant parties.\n\n## Submission Period (30 days)\n\nThis submission period lasts 30 days, during which delegates and contributors are invited to make their submissions. Those interested in participating will have to create a forum post under a designated Strategic Objective Setting (SOS) subcategory. The goal-setting methodology utilized will be the Objectives and Key Results framework, where each objective (high-level, inspirational goal) is accompanied by key results (specific, measurable outcomes) that once reached, represent an objective having been completed. As a reminder, these objectives should indisputably align with the DAO\u2019s mission, vision, and purpose. At a minimum, a valid submission must include the following information:\n\n1. View of Arbitrum\u2019s current state and what its strengths/weaknesses are\n2. Short-term objectives (1 year)\n3. Mid-term objectives (2 years)\n5. Key results, i.e., measurable success metrics, for all objectives\n6. Risks connected to all objectives\n7. High-level estimates of non-capital resources needed for each objective\n8. Rationale explaining how the objectives align with Arbitrum\u2019s MVP and why they were chosen given Arbitrum\u2019s current state\n\nThe format for a SOS submission post on the forum is as follows (note, while the Title and headers should follow the below format, the information under each header is up to the author; this is a non-exhaustive list):\n\n* Title\n  * Format: [SOS Submission] {Delegate} \u2013 Strategic Objectives\n  * Example: [SOS Submission] Entropy Advisors \u2013 Strategic Objectives\n* Summary\n  * A brief summary of the strategic objectives\n  * High-level explanation of their impact on Arbitrum.\n  * Main focus areas for each proposed objective (i.e., Stylus, Orbit, Gaming, etc.)\n* Rationale\n  * A general overview of Arbitrum\u2019s current state, including where the author sees the ecosystem\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\n  * Explanation of how these objectives are aligned with Arbitrum\u2019s MVP, why they were chosen given Arbitrum\u2019s current state, and what risks, required non-capital resources, and expected outcomes are related to the objectives.\n  * Key assumptions and strategic reasoning behind chosen objectives.\n* 1-Year Strategic Objectives & Key Results\n  * A clear and specific statement of each objective.\n  * ~2-5 measurable key results/success metrics per objective.\n\n* 2-Year Strategic Objectives & Key Results\n  * Same format as 1-year strategic objectives.\n* Further Details\n  * Anything else the author feels as though relevant to include in their submission.\n\n### Condensed Example of a 2-Year Strategic Objective (figures are illustrative):\n\nObjective: Arbitrum becomes the indisputable leader within a selection of onchain finance-related verticals: stablecoins, RWAs, and lending.\n\nAlignment with the MVP: As onchain finance-related verticals continue to grow in usage, importance, and impact, it is imperative for Arbitrum to achieve a market-leading position in a certain set of these sectors. Doing so ensures that the ecosystem stays aligned with its vision of being the home for the universal shift onchain, with Arbitrum rollups as the first stop in crypto for users and the default platform for developers.\n\nKey Result 1: Arbitrum One becomes the second largest blockchain in terms of stablecoin volume traded on onchain exchanges.\n\nKey Result 2: RWAs (excluding stablecoins) held within the Arbitrum ecosystem grow by 20x from when the DAO chooses its set of objectives.\n\nKey Result 3: The Arbitrum ecosystem reaches a 30% market share of all outstanding onchain loans.\n\nWhile the number of strategic objectives in a matrix is not limited, proposers should consider the DAO\u2019s capacity to effectively focus on multiple areas simultaneously. Moreover, while the objectives should be aspirational, they must also be attainable. When providing feedback or choosing a specific objective matrix, we encourage delegates to evaluate their feasibility critically. Implementing unrealistic objectives and key results would most likely result in wasted efforts and be counterproductive.\n\nA given year\u2019s objectives are expected to be limited to a specific focus area and not to overlap with each other. As such, we recommend submitters refrain from proposing objectives that are too high level since the potential for overlap increases. Having said that, the sets of 1- and 2-year objectives can be the same as long as key results across years are different.\n\nSee this example from [Hasu\u2019s proposed goals for Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590). When objectives form a cohesive, well-documented strategy, it is more likely to gain support from delegates. Just giving the DAO a list of objectives likely will not be sufficient; the expectation is for the objectives to make up a holistic strategy with a well-reasoned rationale.\n\n## Feedback period (21 days)\n\nOnce the submission period is over, no new objective matrices can be put forward. The submission period is followed by a 21-day feedback period. During this time, submitters are prohibited from making changes to their submissions to allow delegates to examine each submission, provide feedback, and propose edits. This period ensures that all delegates have ample time to familiarize themselves with each submission and that everyone is commenting on the same submission versions.\n\n## Revision Period (14 days)\n\nDuring the revision period, submitters may amend their objective matrices based on community feedback if they wish to do so. Apart from making edits, this period enables submitters to merge their proposals with others, mixing and matching objectives across submissions (note that a given year\u2019s objectives should still have no overlap). If two or more proposals are merged, proposers should post the final version as a new submission in the SOS subcategory and modify the original submissions\u2019 titles to indicate that they have been merged as well as include a link to the merged version at the top of the original submissions. If a proposer feels as though their objectives and key results are already adequately covered by another submission, they are also free to withdraw their submission during the revision period. At the end of the revision period, submissions will be locked and considered as the final versions, which will be the ones put up for a Snapshot vote to choose the DAO\u2019s strategic objectives matrix.\n\n## Voting period (7 days)\n\nFinally, the voting period. Entropy will be in charge of creating a Snapshot vote with a list containing all finalized strategic objective matrices in a single proposal, with delegates voting on which matrix they are the most aligned with and see as optimal. The Snapshot will utilize single-choice voting with an option to abstain. Quorum is reached when at least 3% of all votable tokens have participated in the Snapshot, with the option that has received the most votes being implemented. A strategic objectives matrix proposer is free to vote on their own submission.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, delegates will vote on standalone matrices formed by sets of 1- and 2-year objectives and key results. Please note that if there is a vast amount of submissions going to a Snapshot vote, Entropy reserves the right to postpone the initiation of the vote following the revision period to ensure that delegates are given some additional time to examine the final versions of submissions. If there is any confusion in navigating the forum throughout this process, e.g., where to post, how to title posts, how to merge proposals with another author/similar proposal, etc., Entropy Advisors will be available to answer any questions from the community.\n\n## Review Phase & Ad Hoc Strategic Objective Adjustments\n\nAfter the initial strategic objectives matrices are defined and one has been chosen, the DAO is encouraged to review the chosen matrix on a yearly basis. This ensures the objectives and their key results remain relevant and aligned with the DAO\u2019s evolving needs and the overall market dynamics. The process is similar to the second phase described earlier, but delegates can propose to modify existing objectives/key results, add new ones, or remove those that are no longer relevant.\n\nA review phase should be initiated 12 months after the previous voting period has ended. Ideally, OpCo has already been operationalized by then, meaning that the DAO can instruct the entity to manage the review phase. As stated earlier, we propose that the research member of the ARDC is initially tasked with providing quarterly reports assessing how the DAO has progressed with respect to its strategic objectives. Once OpCo is operationalized, this responsibility could also be transferred to the entity if the DAO chooses to do so.\n\nThe review phase is initiated by passing a Snapshot vote. In the proposal, the proposer must define who is in charge of managing the review phase. Given the review phase Snapshot vote passes, there will be a 14-day notice period. This will consist of a forum post updating delegates on the current state of the strategic objectives and informing them on what this review phase consists of. Among other things, this forum post should include:\n\n1. A summary of the strategic objectives and how successful the DAO has been with respect to fulfilling them.\n2. The expected start and end dates of all the subsequent periods.\n3. Guidelines on how to submit an amendment.\n4. Link to a FAQ forum thread where delegates can submit questions about the program.\n\nAfter the notice period, delegates are invited to submit amendments to the initially chosen strategic objectives matrix during a 30-day submission period. Amendments are not limited to simply modifying strategic objectives and key results. They can also involve removing, adding, or replacing specific objectives and associated key results.\n\nOnce the submission period ends, amendment submissions go through a 21-day feedback period during which no changes can be made to the submissions. Finally, a 14-day revision period will take place during which proposers can make edits to their proposed matrices and merge them with other proposed matrices before being locked and put up for a Snapshot vote to choose the new objective matrix. If no amendment submissions are made, there is no need to move to the feedback, revision, or voting periods, and the old objectives matrix will remain effective.\n\nNote that the review phase timeline given above can be modified at the discretion of the review phase proposer depending on the number of submissions made.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the SOS review phase should be conducted annually, with each cycle beginning 12 months after the conclusion of the previous voting period. However, if there's a pressing need to review the strategic objectives due to, e.g., changes in the market environment, competitive space, or the DAO\u2019s financials, a delegate can create a forum post outlining extensive reasoning for ad hoc adjustments accompanied by the proposed strategic objectives and related key results. Allowing for at least one week for discussion, the forum post will then be put up for a Snapshot vote utilizing single-choice voting with the options of adopting the proposed objectives and key results, initiating a fast-tracked review phase with a similar structure as described above (again, the proposer has to define who is managing this phase), and leaving the current objectives and key results unchanged.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that a well-structured strategy objectives matrix **should not be expected to be changed frequently**. As such, a proposed ad hoc adjustment must be extremely rigorously argumented and only take place if most of the previous strategic objectives have been reached or given unprecedented/emergency circumstances. Moreover, delegates ought to be highly critical when such adjustments are proposed. For example, the proposer simply stating that they disagree with the current objectives should not be a strong enough reason to modify the objectives.\n\nIf an objectives matrix is changed on an ad hoc basis, the originally scheduled review phase will be pushed back. This phase should only be initiated once 12 months have elapsed since the previous vote to change the DAO\u2019s strategic objectives and related key results has passed.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO\u2019s strategic objectives and related key results can be removed by creating a forum post explaining the reasoning to do so. Allowing for at least one week for discussion, the post will be moved to a single-choice Snapshot vote with the voting options \u201cFor\u201d, \u201cAgainst\u201d, and \u201cAbstain\u201d, requiring a simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d for the proposal to pass.\n\nPreviously chosen, not yet achieved objectives and related key results will remain active during a Review/Ad Hoc Strategic Objective Adjustments Phase to ensure the continuity of the DAO's strategic direction, replaced only once a new objectives matrix has been selected through a dedicated voting process. I.e., unless the DAO votes to remove its objectives, the continuity of the SOS is ensured.\n\n# Timeline\n\n* First Phase (Ratification of the SOS Framework):\n  * Review, Feedback, & Edit Period: January 10th - January 23rd\n  * Snapshot Period: January 23rd - January 30th\n* Second Phase (Ratification of a Strategic Objectives Matrix):\n  * Notice Period: 14 days (note that this period's initiation might be pushed back slightly such that submitters will have more time to include possible takeaways from ETHDenver into their matrices during the Submission Period) \n  * Submission Period: 30 days\n  * Feedback Period: 21 days\n  * Revision Period: 14 days\n  * Voting Period: 7 days\n* Review Phase (Potential Amendments to the Strategic Objectives Matrix): Initiated 12 months after the previous voting period has ended or as a result of an ad hoc adjustments proposal as described above.\n\n*Note that any of the time periods in the first and second phases can be shortened/extended at Entropy\u2019s discretion depending on the number of submissions received.*", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "33a2a54b-b353-4d90-80b8-a512f9c8feae", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x72e722e990f6a6863648abbad62db909bfdaf991ddb8a08706551b24ac0b2864", "title": "Steer LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0xF92F185AbD9E00F56cb11B0b709029633d1E37B4", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x72e722e990f6a6863648abbad62db909bfdaf991ddb8a08706551b24ac0b2864", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [89782365.7596277, 15259206.654156558, 25872488.204155784], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.729", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/steer-protocol-ltipp-application-draft/22089\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nSteer is operating in a crowded field (liquidity management on DEXs) but in a niche with large TAM and growing adoption over the past few months.

If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD doesn\u2019t pass - the Arbitrum Foundation will return these funds, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD only proposes the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet introduce an economic incentive mechanism to grow the validator set (since Arbitrum only needs 1 honest, active proposer at any point in time). Without this incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. There can only be 1 \u201cactive\u201d proposer at any point.\n- **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state.\n- **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n- **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n- **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n- **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer *must* have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n- **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n## Budget Request\n\n### Service Fees for BoLD Validators\n\nAll blockchains, including Arbitrum One, should compensate participants who actively work to progress the chain.\n\nFor Arbitrum One, the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) proposes that the DAO pay a service fee to an active proposer who is advancing the chain by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet, which at the time of writing is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH per year ([Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr)). \n\nNOTE: This payment is a fee and not a reward. In both the currently deployed protocol and in BoLD, a new assertion is posted every hour and only the time that the proposer is considered actively bonded will be used to determine the fee amount. Additionally, proposers are only eligible for this fee when their assertion is confirmed. There can be multiple actors who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1 (i.e. active).\n\nWe estimate the following service fee per year:\n- Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer (at this assumed rate).\n\nThe Foundation therefore requests 500 ETH to support service fee payments for up to 3 years (144*3 years plus a buffer of 68 ETH) in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. \n\nTo learn more about service fees, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7).\n\nNote: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee since the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to use the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s funds.\n\n### Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs\n\nThe Foundation is requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain. It is estimated that 400 ETH will be sufficient to cover ~3 years of operational costs.\n\nThere are two on-chain gas costs:\n- **Posting assertions**. An active proposer must post an assertion for the chain to advance.\n- **Challenges**. A proposer who is defending the system must participate in a multi-round challenge process.\n\nNote: we only propose to reimburse L1 gas costs since that is publicly verifiable and computable by all. The off-chain costs to run a proposer will not be reimbursed.\n\n#### Estimated Reimbursement Costs\n\nAssuming a nominal gas price of 50 gwei/gas during normal operations (i.e. no challenges) and assuming an elevated 500 gwei/gas price during a challenge (i.e. worst-case scenario), to fully reimburse an honest party\u2019s gas costs the Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 400 ETH for 3 years.\n\nThis includes ~308 ETH to cover the above costs and a ~92 ETH buffer in the event of higher gas prices during normal operations, during a challenge, and/or in the event that there is more than one challenge per year.\n\nTo learn more about these calculations, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-funds-to-bootstrap-the-first-bold-validator/24506#reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7).\n\n## Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate.\n2. Two separate temperature checks on Snapshot.\n  a. Bond sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BoLD validator.\n  b. Operational cost sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer, totalling 900 ETH.\n3. Depending on the temperature check result:\n  a. Continue to Tally. If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.\n  b. Re-iterate on numbers. If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until these is consensus.\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD is passed.\n\n## Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 900 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n- 500 ETH as service fees for active BoLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and,\n- 400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.\n\nNotable points:\n- Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to the service fee,\n- Arbitrum Foundation will be reimbursed for the L1 gas costs,\n- All service fee payments and L1 gas reimbursements for non-Arbitrum Foundation actors will be manually processed by the Arbitrum Foundation periodically alongside a requirement that all payments adhere to the Foundation\u2019s compliance process.\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO. Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury by revoking the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s proposer at any time and returning the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n- **Withdrawal Address**. The funds will be deposited into BoLD from the Arbitrum Foundation-controlled multi-sig address but the withdrawal address will be set to the \u2018UpgradeExecutor\u2019 contract on L1.\n- **Triggering Withdrawal**. The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s treasury).", "match_confidence": 0.7619, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "35e9a270-d40d-40f5-90ce-b4183772b483", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x29dd01ffe47f08352a79e5b8aab35d3cf8ba5bc60710fedeea821df181afcb23", "title": "Perpie LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0x18BF1a97744539a348304E9d266aAc7d446a1582", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x29dd01ffe47f08352a79e5b8aab35d3cf8ba5bc60710fedeea821df181afcb23", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [170650132.37929496, 45890.51350774193, 547205.3687445368], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.432", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/perpie-ltipp-application-draft/22079\n\n## Council - 3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nPerpie\u2019s application is pretty solid and ticks off a lot of criteria.

Their contributions extend to collaborating on [open-source projects for major DAOs](https://x.com/0xMilton/status/1755972182553899487?s=20), enhancing Ethereum Foundation-funded initiatives, building complex DeFi protocols, SmartContracts and offering a [developer platform](http://www.platform.wakeuplabs.io/) that facilitates robust and scalable API calls for smart contract deployment without requiring Solidity programming skills. (Currently operating even on the Arbitrum blockchain).\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nThe Arbitrum Sequencer is a critical component of the network, responsible for submitting users' transactions to L1.\n\nUnder the current  model, the Sequencer represents a point of failure that, if compromised, could delay or prevent transaction processing.\n\nThere are ways to bypass it, but non-developer users lack that capability.\n\nThis proposal seeks to mitigate such risks by providing a user-friendly alternative transaction submission pathway, thereby enhancing the network's resilience, user autonomy, and their confidence in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\n- **Decentralization and user empowerment:** By enabling direct L1 transaction submissions, users can circumvent Sequencer outages or censorship, maintaining their ability to transact without interruption. This capability is crucial for ensuring the network's operational integrity and aligns with the principle of progressive decentralization.\n- **Enhancing trustless security:** The proposed interface would serve as a valuable tool in rare situations where the Sequencer fails to perform its duties. It ensures that the Arbitrum Rollup maintains its trustless security model, even when permissioned components of the system are not functioning correctly.\n\n### **WakeUp Labs core team**\n\n- **[Milton Berman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miltonberman/)**, co-founder and CEO, brings extensive experience as a CTO in a decentralized identity project supported by IDB Lab and Bitcoin NGO. He has also worked as a Product Owner at Rootstock blockchain and as a CTO in a mobile game studio company. With a background in working with large corporations, Milton possesses the technical expertise and strategic vision necessary to drive the success of our project.\n- **[Maximiliano del Hoyo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximiliandh/)**, co-founder and CBDO, has a diverse background in software and finance. His previous experience at notable companies like Microsoft and Nestle provides him with the necessary knowledge and network to navigate the intersection of technology and business, ensuring the effective achievement of the project's goals.\n- **[Gonzalo Silman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-silman/)**, co-founder and COO, possesses a unique blend of expertise in economics (former university professor), finance, and entrepreneurial experience in creating gaming products for LATAM communities. This diverse background brings a fresh perspective and innovative thinking to our project, enabling us to understand user needs and craft tailored solutions that resonate with our target audience.\n\n### **Proposal Details**\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n1. **Transaction Monitoring:** Develop functionality to listen for user transactions on L2 that are not included by the Sequencer, with guidance from the Arbitrum SDK documentation.\n2. **Manual Transaction Hash Input:** In cases where automatic detection is not feasible, provide a user interface for manually entering the transaction hash or implement manually the previous transaction in the new solution.\n3. **L1 Transaction Replication:** Implement mechanisms to replicate the intended L2 transaction on L1, using \"Forced Withdrawal\" type transactions to push the L2 transaction from L1.\n4. **Confirmation Display:** Ensure the interface provides feedback once the transaction has successfully been processed.\n5. **Processing Time Consideration:** Account for the approximately 24-hour processing period to prevent errors or transaction duplication across chains.\n6. **Hosting, Service & Maintenance:**\u00a0WakeUp will host the service, ensuring it runs 24/7. For the first three months, we will fine-tune and iterate the service. Additionally, should any problems occur, the WakeUp team is committed to identifying and resolving these issues for a minimum of the next two years.\n\n### Development Roadmap & Budget Allocation:\n\n1. **Technical Research, POC, Documentation and Testing (3 weeks, $ARB 9000):**\nDeep dive into the Delayed Inbox functionality and its integration, along with creating a PoC and validating the necessity of a new internal tool for transaction monitoring and sequencer status. We will also carefully check that our solution doesn't disrupt the proper functioning of Arbitrum; if it does, we will enable this instance only when the official sequencer is not operating correctly. This research conducted by the WakeUp Team will be made public, and the community will be able to view it, both in a summary Twitter Thread and in an Article shared on the OSS Github repository once completed.\n2. **Endpoint Development (1.5 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\nCreation of endpoints to interact with the backend logic.\n3. **Logic Integration and Testing (2 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\nConnecting the frontend to the endpoints and verifying the operational logic, and test heavily the MVP.\n4. **Design Phase (4 weeks, $ARB 5000):**\nAdditional time allocated for the design process, ensuring a user-friendly experience.\n5. **UI Development (3 weeks, $ARB 5500):**\nCrafting an aesthetic and intuitive user interface inspired by existing high-quality designs.\n6. **Open-source Preparation (3 weeks, $ARB 6000):**\nFinalizing and documenting the codebase for open-source release.\n7. **Service & Maintenance after Launch (24 months, $ARB 10000).**\nWe commit to hosting the site on Vercel or AWS, ensuring 24/7 operation for at least 24 months. Initially, the WakeUp team will refine the website based on user and Arbitrum community feedback and conduct continuous testing to ensure its reliability. Any issues, such as downtime or crashes, will be promptly addressed by the WakeUp team at least for the next two years.\n\n### **Budget and Resources**\n\n- **Estimated Timeframe:** Approximately 4.25 months for full implementation, including design phases; followed by 3 months dedicated to post-launch iterations and 24 months of hosting, monitoring, and bug fixing to address any possible error.\n- **Development Team:** One full-time Sr Solidity developer for the core implementation and Research, additional design and developer resources for the UI/UX phase. The proposal also considers a Sr part-time dev for the Maintenance after launch.\nGonzalo or Milton from the core team will also keep track of the project as PO.\n- **Cost Estimate:** 42.500 $ARB\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nDeveloping a front-end interface to enable force-including transactions during Sequencer downtime is a crucial requirement in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal aims to empower users by ensuring transaction capabilities even when the Sequencer is unavailable. By doing so, it aligns with Arbitrum's goals of decentralization and enhancing user autonomy.\n\nAdditionally, the project will provide the open-source code for the back-end solution, thereby improving trust in the solution and tool.\n\n### 03/11/2024 - Notes:\n\nSome changes have been made in this proposal, thanks to the feedback provided by @cp0x, @maxlomu and @frisson.", "match_confidence": 0.8791, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "3a70d6a9-8d9b-4f44-8ad8-4af11e9fbca5", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xd096c5d610d4455bcae4bff719d18345939c5d6b20d56c6a1f37d0247ad10f71", "title": "Pilot for a Questbook Jumpstart fund for problem definition and DAO improvement", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd096c5d610d4455bcae4bff719d18345939c5d6b20d56c6a1f37d0247ad10f71", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-07-15 22:59:19", "voting_end": "2024-07-22 22:59:19", "options": {"scores": [1988954.5339579, 21998523.003824156, 106967524.70592491, 15810779.637493914], "choices": ["In favor, and including playbook", "In favor, but excluding playbook", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-07-22 22:59:19", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.121", "body": "# Jumpstart fund for DAO improvement\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n\nChallenge Statement: The DAO struggles with funding the initial steps needed for problem definition, alignment and scoping, causing slow progress and overburdening delegates with inadequate proposals.\nTeam Lead: Daniel, @mrjackalop on telegram \n\n\n[Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WcCyR5Ty6SMsRNqykT5ZHTwdE_RQde4ddemh3P6fP68/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n[2 min video](https://www.loom.com/share/c4ee6c313a514e939f7c2ff0087efcbd?sid=5f6e4c5d-c1e5-4789-80fb-496e7c652e14)\n\n\n# Abstract\nThis proposal allows the DAO to proactively define key problem areas and have the community untangle them, as opposed to having delegates be reactive to proposals that benefit small subgroups of community members.\nThe DAO currently struggles with funding the initial steps needed for problem definition, alignment and scoping, causing slow progress and overburdening delegates with inadequate proposals. To address this, a pilot fund is proposed, utilizing Questbook's small grants model to support early-stage initiatives focused on problem definition (root causes, gathering requirements), alignment, and scoping proposals for operational and governance improvements. A problem gathering exercise will be conducted to inform proposers and the assessor by identifying key problem areas through user research interviews, qualitative surveys of delegates and other stakeholders, and a collective intelligence algorithm, clustering initiatives to ensure alignment between proposals and the DAO's current needs.\nThe pilot fund will prioritize initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO's operations and governance. An assessor, elected by the DAO, will oversee the proposal assessment, following the established Questbook program rules. The success of this pilot will be measured by the number of initiatives that receive subsequent funding, clarity and alignment generated within the community, and an over 80% approval rate in a Snapshot vote to continue the program.\n\n\n# The Problem:\n\n\nThe DAO has multiple challenges but currently needs a way to fund the initial steps of addressing them. As a result, only groups with a lot to win will invest all the necessary time and effort and take the risk to evolve a proposal without being paid.\n\n\nAreas like organisation design, strategy, spending plan, and more require not just crafting a proposal but they require problem definition work: significant stakeholder engagement to determine the right approach, understand root causes and requirements, generate buy-in, and craft the right proposal to make. There\u2019s currently no way to fund all this problem definition and preparatory work leading to the DAO advancing slowly, delegates being overwhelmed assessing proposals that don\u2019t quite hit the mark, and meanwhile key decisions and needed proposals don\u2019t happen.\n\n\n# Proposed Solution:\n\n\n1. A method for the DAO to aggregate challenge statements or problems\n2. A funding program for initiatives that will carry out problem definition and initial solution work on one of the challenge statements.\n\n\nQuestbook has shown to be a viable mechanism for distributing small grants to groups. We propose to use this model and set up a pilot fund to evolve proposals that address key Operational and Governance needs to improve Arbiturm DAO.\n\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ll carry out a \u201ccollective intelligence exercise\u201d to identify the key problem areas.\nAnd we're including an option in the Snapshot to also fund a Playbook for Proposing to the DAO, where we'll gather the learnings of the grantees who successfully pass a proposal through the DAO and the challenges of those who didn't, and document them as material for future grantees.\n\n\n**What will be funded via the Jumpstart Fund:**\n\n\n* Early-stage initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO ops and gov\n* Priority for funding initiatives advancing problem definition and alignment around key challenges.\n* Requirement for being referred by at least 3 of the top 30 delegates.\n* Priority for proposals including a last milestone for a successful snapshot vote (i.e. success bonus of at least 10%).\n* Initiatives expected to last up to 3 months.\n* Initiatives can request up to USD$50k equivalent (subsequent submissions considered).\n* product/protocol development will not be funded (that\u2019s better suited for other Questbook tracks or programs).\n\n\n**How are proposals assessed:**\n\n\n* An assessor will be selected by the DAO via an election as conducted for previous Questbook tracks.\n* Proposals up to USD $25k can be approved directly by the assessor for this track. Proposals above this amount requires cross-checking with the assessors form other tracks.\n\n\n**Fund governance:**\n\n\nThis track will follow the same rules as the ongoing Questbook program ([link](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326)), whereby funds are held in the multisig operated by the assessors of the multiple Questbook tracks.\nThe totality of the funds are to be transferred there and the signers will provide payment for the service provision parts upon completion (e.g. problem assessment, playbook if completed, etc).\n\n\n**Method to Identify Problem Areas:**\n\n\nBefore opening the fund to proposals, we\u2019ll work with the DAO to identify key problem areas that could then lead to proposals for problem definition and alignment work. This work will be carried by RnDAO's research team.\n\n\nBased on Professor Daniel Kahneman\u2019s work, we have selected a collective intelligence method that provides high efficiency (low time involvement required from delegates) and is credibly neutral. The method is based on the use of a qualitative survey of delegates and other stakeholders to collect a list of statements proposing key challenges. We'll complement this mechanism with user research interviews with the top 30 delegates.\nThe statements are then analysed using a collective intelligence algorithm (SimScore) that identifies a theoretical \u2018central\u2019 statement that would be most agreed upon, and then analyses the provided statements to rank them for proximity to said theoretical centre.\n\n\nThe ranked statements, as well as the graph (positioning of statements relative to each other), will then be made publicly available to inform (not mandate, just inform) those proposing initiatives to the pilot fund.\n\n\n(Further untangling between statements and root cause analysis is part of the work this Questbook track will fund.)\n\n\n# Timeline:\n\n\nThe Pilot is expected to last 4-6 months depending on whether the option to distil learnings into a playbook for proposing to the DAO is approved in Snapshot or not.\n\n\n* Month 1 for identifying problem areas.\n* Month 2-4 for assessing and funding proposals.\n* Month 5 for reporting\n* month 6 for (optional) collecting learnings about proposal development into playbook\n\n\n# What does success look like?\n\n\n* Experts in the community can work towards improving Arbiturm DAO.\n* The initiatives funded generate clarity, buy-in, and alignment,\n* The initiatives funded evolve towards full proposals for the DAO and are funded.\n* The delegates love this pilot and want to continue funding it.\n\n\n**KPIs:**\n\n\n* 40%+ of initiatives continued and received subsequent funding\n* Over 80% approval in a Snapshot vote asking delegates whether the program should be continued after the pilot\n\n\n# Budget \n![Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 4.57.04 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigovxyqq2et74lbej5yjjpwfdt4wgxdg5mz4rcvhjpk75owswl62a)", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "3bfc8eb2-7f2b-490d-800f-a0776842acf4", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xfa78979a7afa0b0df5c885ebf3a0d46c3676152c6c95b482ed9e91c2ed2dcca5", "title": "Domain Allocator Election for the New Protocol Ideas Domain", "author_name": "0xb29A655f3D67B2B6724Fb22B2C2303cB660c946B", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xfa78979a7afa0b0df5c885ebf3a0d46c3676152c6c95b482ed9e91c2ed2dcca5", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-09-06 17:48:14", "voting_end": "2023-09-13 17:48:14", "options": {"scores": [57964352.892102234, 1004403.6875868916, 45147948.328126274, 745270.2606302015, 189100.0387321559, 255592.53153481704, 114897.89931475864, 139801.7813851954, 109112.54888953811], "choices": ["Jojo", "Ceazor", "Matt (StableLabs)", "McFly", "Blocktools", "Marc (Blockshard)", "Zer8", "Jonas", "Apoorv Anand"]}, "last_activity": "2023-09-13 17:48:14", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.642", "body": "**Introduction:** This is a vote to elect the Domain Allocator for the New Protocol Ideas domain within the Arbitrum ecosystem grants run through the Delegated Domain Allocation model.

With the introduction of incentives, these numbers are expected to grow even further. Additionally, a portion of their incentives will be allocated to partner incentives for their deBridge API integration, enhancing their composability with other ecosystem projects. The proposal outlines clear milestones, and if achieved, they have the potential to attract a significant number of users to Arbitrum. The proposal is well-written and deserving of support. DeBridge has experienced significant growth and is seeking $1 million in incentives to reduce costs and friction for entry into the Arbitrum ecosystem. The proposed milestones aim for ambitious targets that, if met, could substantially improve the accessibility and ease-of-use of Arbitrum. This grant is expected to be a net benefit to the ecosystem, considering DeBridge's pre-incentive usage and the likelihood of retaining users post-incentives. Overall, the proposal is viewed positively, with confidence in DeBridge's ability to contribute positively to the ecosystem. \n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR deBridge's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across rubric. The grant request, while large, is well justified and structured across end users (makers, takers, and integration partners). Milestones/KPIs are well justified and realistic to be achieved with added incentives from the program. Would have loved more detail regarding Arbitrum integration partners and any plans to continue to grow this over time.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nDeBridge presented a strong application that scored well across most of the rubric. They provided strong justification for a rather large grant ask and presented a thorough execution strategy. One major issue with the proposal is around the subsidizing of outflows from Arbitrum. While this action is subsidized at a fraction of inflows, this is not an action that we would like to see incentivized and led to a point deduction. Regardless, their recent growth along with their strong justification has lead us to support this proposal.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "3d08b38e-aea2-4826-a347-96af0d93724d", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x399ccb013b49076b1ec98dd48fb088c061d3a1db45b528d8854d59c4dabe2336", "title": "Domain Allocator Election for the Gaming Domain", "author_name": "0xb29A655f3D67B2B6724Fb22B2C2303cB660c946B", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x399ccb013b49076b1ec98dd48fb088c061d3a1db45b528d8854d59c4dabe2336", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-09-06 17:39:32", "voting_end": "2023-09-13 17:39:32", "options": {"scores": [26092572.15299356, 795773.8679203837, 14281724.398744864, 48437820.3762562], "choices": ["Jeremy", "Idea2IDO Investing", "Bob Rossi", "Adam (Flook)"]}, "last_activity": "2023-09-13 17:39:32", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.651", "body": "**Introduction:** This is a vote to elect the Domain Allocator for the Gaming domain within the Arbitrum ecosystem grants run through the Delegated Domain Allocation model.

The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition\u2019s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO\u2019s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition\u2019s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO\u2019s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it\u2019s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal\u2019s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can\u2019t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world\u2019s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They\u2019ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3\u2019s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi\u2019s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (\u201cthe Coalition\u201d): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition\u2019s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate\u2019s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO\u2019s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO\u2019s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO\u2019s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO\u2019s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, \u2026 ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, \u2026)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO\u2019s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet\u2019s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition\u2019s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research\u2019s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition\u2019s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following \u00be starting 91 days from the AIP\u2019s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal.

While the protocol has strong TVL on Ethereum mainnet, there is very little traction on other chain deployments. This is further confirmed by daily transfers, daily volume, and total USDM holders. Thus, given the lack of holders on Ethereum and other chains, we also expect incentives to land in a concentrated number of wallets.\n\nGoals, milestones, and KPIs were rather clear for the most part, however, there was little detail about the execution strategy and goals for \u2018DeFi Partner Integrations\u2019. The large focus on pure liquidity mining efforts without additional mechanisms does not provide a compelling case for such the size of the grant request.\n\nUnfortunately, we will not be supporting this proposal.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nWhile we gave this application an average score, we still support it on the basis that we believe incentivizing liquidity for a yield-bearing asset pair is important. Deep liquidity in yield-bearing stablecoin / LST pairs will be a strong competitive advantage for Arbitrum. However, this application was lacking in a few areas such as incentive distribution, as traditional liquidity incentives will likely result in incentives landing in the hands of whales, and the execution strategy regarding DeFi Partner Integrations lacked clear details. But overall, Mountain Protocol has a good team and decent traction on mainnet which make for nice additions to our main reasonings for support. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote AGAINST Mountain Protocol's proposal.\n\nWell-written proposal that ranked decently on the rubric and impressive adoption to-date from a market share perspective re: yield-bearing stablecoin backed by T-bills. While Mountain has seen strong adoption on Ethereum Mainnet, this is very limited in other ecosystems including Arbitrum. The current traction and execution plan to bring TVL into the Arbitrum ecosystem is lacking and may lead to concentrated number of wallets. The execution strategy to build stickiness is limited and centered around institutional players. Need more information and pserspective on composability / integration with other DeFi partners on Arbitrum to paint a better picture to pass this through to the DAO.\"\t\t\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nWe generally thought this grant plan was well constructed, but was expensive relative to the existing Arbitrum footprint of USDM. Other areas of the rubric were able to overcome this penalty in score, however. We recommend approving this grant.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to introduce and bootstrap USDM, a leading yield-bearing stablecoin, into the Arbitrum ecosystem. By incentivizing liquidity provision and fostering partnerships with DeFi protocols, the initiative aims to drive significant TVL growth on Arbitrum, ultimately strengthening both USDM and Arbitrum within the DeFi landscape. The requested grant size is justified based on projected TVL acquisition costs, offering a cost-effective approach compared to previous rounds. The execution plan is well-defined, with clear objectives, milestones, and KPIs to track success. The inclusion of specific KPIs related to USDM TVL, usage in DeFi protocols, and volume transacted with USDM provides a robust framework for measuring the effectiveness of the grant. Additionally, the proposal demonstrates a commitment to sustainability, aiming to establish use cases that are self-sustaining once bootstrapped. Overall, accepting this proposal would ramp-up the growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem, solidifying its position as a leader in DeFi.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "3f812fac-efda-4d83-b8a9-dedbd200d724", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x0a3a7b84c7c01cc0feb8a7fad662cbf1f5aeb1b089b205ce412e2bc01d99c504", "title": "John Kennedy reconfirmation for AGV council", "author_name": "0x4F685B29514eed0c9D929386E86D9cd81981118B", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x0a3a7b84c7c01cc0feb8a7fad662cbf1f5aeb1b089b205ce412e2bc01d99c504", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-11-20 11:56:23", "voting_end": "2025-11-27 11:56:23", "options": {"scores": [126254156.24275193, 6965037.28941554, 53663954.33908016], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-11-27 11:56:23", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:58.611", "body": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks DAO approval for John Kennedy, one of the two candidates nominated by the existing council to sit in the 2026 term. As a reminder, the existing AGV Council\u2019s nominations are Tim Chang, with core competency in Venture Capital and Investments, and John Kennedy, with core Competency in Game Development and Go-To-Market Leader\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nBuilding on the governance practice established with AGV and subsequently OpCo, which combined appointed and elected positions, this election proposes a hybrid approach for filling council seats.\n\nEnsuring continuity of institutional knowledge across our oversight, advisory, and investment programs is critical for effective governance. Having experienced DAO representatives who understand our historical context and strategic direction, independent of the operational team hired to lead these initiatives, helps maintain stability during transitions and preserves organizational memory that might otherwise be lost.\n\nTo address this need, the existing AGV council has voted to nominate two candidates for continuity seats, subject to DAO reconfirmation prior to the election, with three additional seats open for a DAO-wide election.\n\n# Council Nomination: John Kennedy\n\nBelow are the extended details of the nominee for reconfirmation:\n\n**Role / Expertise**\n\nGame Development / Go-To-Market Leader\n\n**Bio**\n\nJohn, formerly Head of Product at AWS GameTech, left in 2023 to launch Actual AI\u2014an engineering manager agent for software teams that provides guardrails for AI-powered software development. Actual AI has received venture funding from AlleyCorp, G2C ventures, OrangeDAO, Alchemist Accelerator, and Irregular Expressions.\n\nAt AWS, John successfully pitched the CEO on transforming Amazon\u2019s Lumberyard into a cutting-edge open-source 3D game engine. He secured a team of over 100 top game engine developers to build Open 3D Engine (o3de.org), a modular, extensible, and high-performance 3D engine featuring a new renderer, visual scripting tool, and physics engine. Additionally, John launched and grew several high-revenue AWS services, enabling game developers to seamlessly serve hundreds of millions of players with capabilities for streaming, multiplayer servers, and cloud storage.\n\nAs a Core Partner at Underscore VC, John has advised numerous early-stage startups on product development and go-to-market strategies. His executive experience spans multiple high-growth startups, including Platform.sh and Acquia. John continues to mentor Series A-C startups, sharing his expertise in scaling businesses.\n\nIn 2024, John co-facilitated Arbitrum\u2019s two GovHack events in collaboration with Hack Humanity at EthDenver and EthCC. Each event drew over 200 participants and resulted in the creation of 48 new governance proposals.\n\n**Major AGV Accomplishments**\n\n* Worked with the team extensively on the formation of the investment thesis, bringing deep gaming industry experience and over 20 years of experience building and marketing digital products.\n* Guided the hiring process, including working on the evaluation rubrics, working with the team and recruiter on candidate triage, and interviewing most candidates.\n* Mentored the team on operations, strategy, and growth, including bi-weekly sessions with the leadership team.\n* Deep deal analysis on all deals that passed IC from the gaming and software development perspective.\n* Met with candidate portfolio companies to vet leadership and technical expertise.\n* Established relationships with partners and portfolio companies.\n\n**Why are you interested in serving on the AGV Council again?**\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the 2nd gaming revolution that is coming to Arbitrum. We have now established the groundwork to execute on our thesis of building a vibrant gaming ecosystem of service providers, games, and gamers. I think we can build the Steam of web3 backed by Arbitrum.\n\nIt has been great to see AGV grow and put down roots. We now have the dream team that is going to blow up the industry. Gaming is in dire need of new channels for user acquisition and monetization. We are in the perfect position to take advantage of this need.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to dive in with the team, guiding portfolio companies on their way to success with GTM and operational expertise, building playbooks, and by connecting the AGV team with new partners who can extend our reach in gaming and AI.\u201d\n\n# Timeline\n\nAn Introduction and Q&A Call was held via Google Meet on November 13th at 5pm UTC.\n\nEach nominated candidate will undergo a separate confirmation Snapshot vote on Thursday, November 20th (this post).\n\n# Voting Options\n\nThis proposal will include the following voting options:\n\n* For\n* Against\n* Abstain\n\nShould FOR be the majority preference, and the combined FOR and ABSTAIN votes meet at least 3% of the total votable ARB supply, the respective candidate will be considered reconfirmed to the AGV council for the 2026 term.\n\nIf this nomination is vetoed by the DAO, that seat will then be added to the Election Process, and the nominee will be automatically entered as an applicant for the Election.

By establishing a transparent and equitable reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, we aim to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication, fostering the growth of our ecosystem.\n\n# Motivation\nThe Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\nRecognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum\u2019s development.\nDemonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\nEstablish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\nInspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n# Rationale\nThe Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in shaping Arbitrum over the past two years. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.\n\n# Partial contribution value\nSince 2021-2023, the work and contributions made by Arbiter are too numerous to list and quantify individually, and the data provided are statistically estimated due to the lack of prior targeted data counting and retention.\n\nProvided millions of help to Arbitrum community users and developers. It allows Arbitrum team members to focus more on the development of technology, and also allows millions of Arbitrum community members to get answers to all kinds of questions and needs feedback. (Anyone can view the help and contributions of the arbitrators on the arbitrum Discord server, wechat groups, and other language communities, etc.)\n\nArbiters are online 24/7 (in Odyssey and Guild activities related to many arbiters are 16 + hours online, for community members to provide the most immediate, high-quality help) arbiter two years, has been involved in the maintenance and management of the community order, to report and stop more than 100,000 times of the scam, to ensure that hundreds of thousands of members of the community are able to get help in a timely manner and to keep the server safe.\n\nEstablish Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and other Arbitrum local communities, such as: Chinese more than 10 WeChat groups, WeChat public number, microblog, Coinhub, and other media (due to policy reasons, a number of Chinese media has canceled the account)\n\nThe establishment of language communities has further expanded Arbitrum\u2019s influence, attracted more than 100,000 users and developers to choose to use Arbitrum, and promoted the prosperity of the ecosystem.\n\nTranslate and proofread more than 50 Arbitrum articles, arbiters in various language areas edit, typeset and publish Arbitrum daily information more than 2,000 times, publish more than 300 articles and blogs, explain more than 50 videos, and all kinds of accounts with a large number of real fans and readers, for hundreds of thousands of users around the world to provide a quick understanding of the use of Arbitrum and the information and guidelines.\n\narbiter has provided community optimization, management, operation, and promotion suggestions for arbitrum more than 300 times, making the system of Arbitrum publicity, service, promotion, and operation more perfect, and allowing Arbitrum users, developers, and ecosystem projects to get better service experience and help.\n\ndock 30 Arbitrum AMA, more than 20 events, more than 100 docking projects, affecting hundreds of thousands of community members, attracting more than 50 projects to choose an arbitrum network for deployment.\n\nSome Arbiters have their own communities, and as KOLs in Twitter and famous communities, they vigorously promote Arbitrum through their own influence, posting blogs and all kinds of information, and their continuous influence involves hundreds of thousands of crypto community users. This has brought great enthusiasm and new users to the Arbitrum community.\n\narbiters has been accompanying and witnessing the prosperous development of the Arbitrum community and ecosystem, continuously carrying forward the spirit of the Arbitrum community and promoting and marketing Arbitrum.\n\nFrom 6,400 wallet addresses at the initial mainnet launch to 1,270,000+ wallet addresses now, including the growth of on-chain TVLs and a thriving ecosystem. Helped and assisted Arbitrum Discord to grow from tens of thousands of members to now 460,000, providing millions of high quality help, all kinds of Arbitrum promotion and publicity with millions of views.\n\nThe following document is the basis for some of the contribute saved\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit?usp=sharing]\n\n# Specifications\n\nBeneficiaries: Arbiters: Comprising the most dedicated contributors to the Arbitrum community over the past two years, recognized for their exceptional and humble service to the Arbitrum community.\n\nDistribution of Incentives: The Arbitrum community requests a total of 500,000 $ARB tokens, to be evenly distributed among 25 of its members, recognizing their past work for the Arbitrum community.\n\nCalculation: 20,000 $ARB tokens per member x 25 Discord Arbiters = 500,000 $ARB.\n\n# Wallet Address Collection and Distribution\nArbiters\u2019 contributor wallet addresses will be collected through a specified process, ensuring accuracy and fairness. If the proposal is approved, the Arbitrum DAO will disburse rewards to each Arbiter contributor\u2019s address, following thorough verification and confirmation.\n\n# Future Plans\nUpon the successful implementation of this proposal, we will continue to enhance Arbiter contribution methods, ensuring the sustained growth of the arbitrum community.\n\narbiters will continue to translate blogs, do publicity, organize AMAs, hold offline activities, provide community suggestions, optimize community services, maintain community order, provide high-quality help to the community, actively connect with various activities and projects, and help promote cooperation with other communities. On the basis of arbitrum, actively participate in the arbitrum Ambassador Program and explore more ways to contribute, and continue to provide value to the broader arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOur goal is to continually contribute value to arbitrum and collaborate with the broader community to foster a vibrant and thriving arbitrum ecosystem.\nAs arbitrum continues to evolve, we will also be able to really demonstrate our knowledge of the protocol and help show more new users that arbitrum is the optimal scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\n# Milestones\nWhen the arbitrum discord server exceeds 700,000 members,or when TVL passes $3b,or when we have helped community members more than two million times, or when we have made significant progress in various types of outreach and publicity. We are committed to transparently communicating milestone updates and displaying data about what arbiters are doing or contributing.\n\nAfter this proposal, we will pay attention to the statistics and retention of examples of contributions made by arbiters, and data. This will facilitate more detailed examples and data presentation at the next milestone.\n\n# Conclusion\nThe implementation of a robust reward system via the Arbitrum DAO is crucial for recognizing and appreciating the invaluable contributions of Arbiters to the community. This initiative will reinvigorate community engagement, foster openness, and encourage sustained participation, ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum community.

This increase is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the network and reduce the financial burden on the Arbitrum Foundation. Given the diminishing relevance of Nova and the evolving Layer 2 landscape, lifting this cap will prevent inefficiencies and unnecessary constraints on network operations.\n\n# Motivation\n\nArbitrum Nova was initially positioned as a cost-efficient alternative to Arbitrum One, offering 30-50x cheaper transaction fees at launch. However, several developments have significantly reduced Nova\u2019s competitive advantage:\n\n* EIP-4844 blobs: The introduction of EIP-4844 significantly reduced the cost difference between Nova and Arbitrum One, from 30-50x to a mere 2x. This difference is negligible given the already low costs on Arbitrum One.\n* Orbit adoption: Orbit chains have become a more attractive option for teams seeking gas sponsorship and customization. Their ease of deployment has led many teams to prefer Orbit chains over Nova.\n\nGiven the now-minimal cost advantage over Arbitrum One and the rise of Orbit chains, maintaining an amortized cost cap on Nova \u2014 which currently prevents batch posters from recovering full L1 costs \u2014 is no longer justifiable. Removing the cap will stop the Arbitrum Foundation from subsidizing these subsidies and align cost recovery with actual usage.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe continued enforcement of an amortized cost cap on Nova introduces inefficiencies that do not align with its current usage patterns and network activity. This setting limits the percentage of L1 posting costs that batch posters can recover from the chain (denominated in basis points, or bips, where 10000 = 100%). Currently, the cap prevents full cost recovery, forcing the Arbitrum Foundation to subsidize the difference. Removing the cap (i.e., setting it to 0 bips) would:\n\n* Ensure batch posters are able to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n* Eliminate recurring deficits currently paid by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* Reflect Nova\u2019s lower strategic priority within the broader Arbitrum roadmap.\n\nHistorical data on Arbitrum Nova batch poster deficits can be seen [here](https://app.hex.tech/8bb08a30-5c58-48c4-acb0-5a0515db9db2/app/0196afd6-bf44-7001-bbb9-c429e3920ca8/latest). \u200bThis data highlights the ongoing inefficiencies and justifies the removal of the amortized cost cap.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Amortized Cost Cap (setAmortizedCostCapBips): A parameter within the ArbOwner system contract that limits the percentage of Layer 1 transaction posting costs that batch posters are allowed to recover from the network. Expressed in basis points (bips), where 10000 = 100%.\n* ArbOwner Contract: A privileged precompiled contract that allows the ArbitrumDAO to configure core protocol settings, such as the amortized cost cap.\n* EIP-4844: An Ethereum Improvement Proposal introducing blob-carrying transactions. Its implementation has significantly reduced the cost disparity between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One, undermining the original economic rationale for Nova\u2019s fee model.\n* Batch poster transactions: Transactions that aggregate multiple operations and submit them as a single on-chain transaction. With the enforced fee cap, these transactions become less cost-effective under current network dynamics, contributing to operational inefficiencies.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe DAO will execute a call to the [ArbOwner contract](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/c32af127fe6a9124316abebbf756609649ede1f5/src/precompiles/ArbOwner.sol#L129C14-L129C37) on Arbitrum Nova to set the amortizedCostCapBips value to 0, thereby allowing batch posters to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nMore detailed information about the specific implementation will be provided closer to the date of the formal on-chain Tally vote.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe following timeline outlines proposed milestones from initial discussions to full implementation. Adjustments may be made based on community feedback and DAO governance requirements.\n\n1. May 29th: AIP forum post outlining the proposed modification to Arbitrum Nova\n2. June 19th: Temperature check held on Snapshot\n3. July/August: Should the temperature check pass, as specified above, it will be included in the AIP draft combining several other maintenance-related proposals for a joint Tally vote.\n4. On-chain Tally vote: Will commence once all other maintenance-related proposals have passed the respective temperature checks on Snapshot.\n5. Post-on-chain Tally vote: Should the Tally vote pass, the waiting period on L2 will last 1 week after Tally vote is finalized, after which, the removal of amortized cost cap will be executed on Arbitrum Nova.\n6.

As the first two employees at Blockworks Research, we felt the vision of what DAOs could deliver versus what they actually resembled in reality warranted more dedicated attention from a team passionate about the potential impact DAOs could have on an ecosystem. It has now been 14 months since Entropy Advisors was incorporated, and while we have accomplished a lot, there is a vast amount of work that remains.\n\nAs this term comes to a close on August 31st, we want to take the opportunity to say thank you to those in the Arbitrum community who have supported our team and given us a path to make an impact on such a large stage by funding us through our first DAO [proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22562217031893796518849144396978331510254494883851105730012486117405397295942). Without the Arbitrum DAO, Entropy Advisors would not have been possible.\n\nThis proposal is to extend our partnership with the DAO for two additional years. If passed, our second official engagement would go into effect on September 1, 2025, immediately following the conclusion of our first mandate. Entropy Advisors\u2019 exclusive focus over the next two years is transforming Arbitrum into the most effective capital allocating DAO in crypto, leveraging treasury strategy, incentives design, data, and special projects to drive compounding, sustainable ecosystem growth\n\n# Motivation and Rationale\n\n## Year 1 Retrospective\n\nWe invite everyone to review our initial [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-exclusively-working-with-arbitrum-dao/25246) and reflect on our successes and failures, and to provide candid feedback to our team as we begin the process towards a second term.\n---\n### Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)\n\n* Neutral Proposal Broker\n* Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO. Facilitate introductions between delegates, contributors, DAO leaders, and key strategic partners.\n* Assist with drafting and delivering proposals from select third parties to the DAO.\n* Proposal Incubation\n* Facilitate the oversight and creation of neutral DAO frameworks and initiatives that do not benefit Entropy and only have the DAO\u2019s best interests in mind.\n* The idea behind Entropy is to assemble a team composed of highly capable DAO contributors with differing perspectives and expertises\u2014we will use our collective brain power to create proposals that benefit Arbitrum over the long term and are aligned with community priorities.\n* Enable the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.\n\n### Strategy and Ecosystem Alignment\n\n* Serve as the liaison between Arbitrum\u2019s key stakeholders\n* Host meetings with key stakeholders and report needs and updates between the relevant parties. Report notes to DAO when able.\n* Turn conversations and takeaways into an actionable plan and begin executing.\n* Product and Strategy\n* Regularly discuss with application developers within the Arbitrum ecosystem, relay this information to development teams/the Foundation, and use the insights to create discussions with clear goals on the Arbitrum governance forum.\n* Assist the key stakeholders on partnerships/integrations as needed. We will serve as an extra set of eyes to highlight emerging technologies and trends within crypto, aiding Arbitrum parties when we can be helpful.\n* Generally speaking, ensure that the Arbitrum DAO is on track to becoming a sustainable entity with sensible spending and a focus on profit generation.\n\n---\n\n**Full-time Arbitrum DAO:** We grew the team from just Sam and Matt to 8 full-time and 1 intern, and we remain laser-focused on attracting the highest quality talent in the space to commit themselves exclusively to Arbitrum. While we believe that we have formed a very strong team thus far, the composition of our team will always be a top priority to ensure we have the tools at our disposal to serve the ecosystem with high-quality execution. In the coming year, we would like to continue growing as needs arise: more data analytics help, applied researchers, TradFi converts, and those with early-stage experience are at the top of mind, with a goal of scaling beyond 10 members on our team.\n![Entropy Proposal 2.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigvqpdyawvkfjl7z2whdmf4cxmyt2ujriakmqllaj3dvk76tu5u2a)\n\n**Beyond Proposals:** Over the past year, Entropy has evolved beyond just a proposals shop and become a recognizable, consistent face of the Arbitrum DAO in the broader crypto community. From press to partnerships, conferences to committees, we\u2019ve built a strong reputation for professionalism, reliability, and alignment. Our ability to foster trust across stakeholders from Offchain Labs and the Foundation to top investors, asset managers, and builders has been one of our most important assets, and something we intend to amplify in years 2 and 3. We recognize that this is where we have produced the most value throughout our first year and aim to continue to grow into our strengths. On countless occasions, we have joined Offchain Labs and Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s partnerships teams in helping outline strategy and closing deals. With some blue-chip ecosystem partners, Entropy works as their main point of contact in Arbitrum. We have grown into a trusted tool augmenting existing AAEs.\n\n**Syncing Stakeholders:** We are happy with our output over the past ~year in regards to the first two deliverables we outlined (see above). We hosted three (a fourth is planned for EthCC) \u201cDelegate Days\u201d in Brussels, Bangkok, and Denver over the past year, where we gathered large delegates, members from Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation, and other stakeholders to align on key objectives over the subsequent quarter(s). We also hosted key stakeholder calls with the same groups once per month in an effort to align on high-importance topics that require attention in the near term. Entropy has also been speaking with OCL, the AF, and key delegates and ecosystem contributors every two weeks to streamline communications across the ecosystem. These efforts are quite time-consuming, but have proven to lead to some of our most impactful work over the past year.\n\n**Strategic Proposals:** We successfully passed a plethora of proposals authored internally, as well as assisted third parties in drafting proposals to the DAO or submitting applications to DAO-led programs. Some examples here include Govhack Brussels, the MSS, The Ethereum Attackathon Sponsorship, leading the ARB staking working group and bolstering the quality of contributors to the research (bringing in Vending Machine and ASXN to assist), the Delegate Code of Conduct, establishing an events budget, getting treasury management moving forward after a long stagnation through the v1.2 proposal, leading the STEP II committee, moving forward with the MVP exercise to align stakeholders, our DRIP proposal to reignite incentives/support for builders and users, the Stylus Sprint, assisting Max Lomu with his chain abstraction proposal, etc. We can\u2019t touch on all of them here, but please refer to our forum [profile](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/entropy/summary) for more information.\n\nImportantly, in many cases, we evaluated whether supporting external contributors/committees or internalizing portions of execution made the most sense for the DAO. In some instances, we chose to execute internally, not because we wanted less external contribution, but because we deemed it the most efficient, high-context, and cost-effective way to get things done. Our north star has always been to make DAO execution smoother, more strategic, and resource-efficient. Sometimes that meant helping third parties structure their ideas, but other times it meant owning the process ourselves to ensure tighter execution, lower overhead, and greater accountability.\n\n**OpCo Groundwork:** We also laid the groundwork for a more expedited proposal process by helping mold the new direction for the Arbitrum DAO, which was recently [posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-vision-for-the-future-of-arbitrum/28962?u=entropy) by the AF, and we also created the [OpCo proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) that should make working with the DAO a much smoother process from the perspective of service providers.\n\nWe expect OpCo to pick up the portion of the aforementioned work that relates to key stakeholder alignment and coordination once it is fully operational. Aligning all the largest stakeholders in the ecosystem in order to allow for more effective operations was a massive undertaking and took a large amount of our bandwidth over the course of our first year. Despite the large investment of time and resources, we believe the groundwork has been laid for a more fruitful future for the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Learning from Mistakes:** While we feel as though we did a great job on setting the DAO\u2019s future, more efficient path, we certainly fell short on numerous occasions. For example, there were some instances in which we poorly communicated with certain ecosystem participants during application processes. As members of the GMC, many protocols that have sunk significant resources into the ecosystem felt overlooked and undercommunicated with. Our team has since shifted focus to improving our relationships with Arbitrum builders and to being more mindful in providing feedback to applicants by overcommunicating. We also realize that our scope of work was extremely wide in our first proposal, and our deliverables have evolved quite a lot since our engagement started, which might have led to some confusion in the wider community around what Entropy\u2019s role actually is. Our wins have taught us a lot, but our mistakes even more, and we are committed to making corrections based on our learnings throughout our first year in our second engagement.\n\n---\nData and Brand Building\n\n* Build up a high-value brand through various mediums, such as X/Twitter with educational content and research, YouTube/Apple/Spotify through a podcast, and email through weekly newsletters.\n* Bring visibility into DAO initiatives and RFPs.\n* Represent the DAO professionally and with a demeanor that the community can be proud of.\n* Aid DAO-funded organizations like the ARDC and OBL in conducting research and analytics to inform proposal development.\n* Utilize data analytics to help the DAO with accountability and transparency around its initiatives.\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Analytics:** In terms of data and brand building, we are very happy with our output over our first ~year. Our data team has created the go-to [Dune catalog](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors) for those looking for greater insight into the Arbitrum ecosystem. It is worth noting that our data team did not begin work until around the end of December, so we have accomplished a lot here in very little time. We have had numerous investors not currently involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem reach out in admiration, which we believe will have a positive downstream impact that is not easily quantifiable. We have also seen our charts shared across dozens of large accounts on X, featured in blogs and news articles, and referred to during big moments for the ecosystem, such as the rollout of [Timeboost](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-timeboost). We have created a [DAO financials](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-financials) dashboard to give delegates better insight into how the DAO spends/earns money, a [dashboard](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-governance-proposals) that enables delegates to dissect various proposals at a granular level, an [RWA case](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-rwa-case-study) study, a [DAO treasury](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-treasury) dashboard showing all the assets it owns, and [more](https://dune.com/discover/content/relevant?q=author:entropy_advisors&resource-type=dashboards).\n\n![Entropy Proposal 3.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeif5zdnyqlkvlsedvyndilxyu6kdfxihxub7rpcfwfb7bli6gt6mue)\n\n**Data as a Growth Support Mechanism:** We also learned that data transparency can serve as a great tool for both increasing our reach across various crypto communities as well as improving relationships on the BD front with builders. This complements the goal stated in the previous section of helping to onboard 3rd parties into the ecosystem. For example, we created the most comprehensive data overview of Ethena, which caught the team\u2019s attention. Members of Entropy then worked with OCL to coordinate a trip to the UK at the end of 2024 to meet the Ethena team as they were deciding which tech stack to deploy Converge on. In April 2025, we saw these efforts pay off with Ethena and Securitize [choosing the Arbitrum stack](https://x.com/convergeonchain/status/1912853619038461967).\n\nWe have ambitions to aid more builders within the Arbitrum ecosystem as a support mechanism, and to continue building resources that serve as both marketing material and a BD tool. Where we fell short on brand relative to our original proposal was podcast content/weekly newsletters. While we view this content as valuable, we simply did not have the bandwidth to prioritize these types of initiatives when considering the high-importance items we needed to facilitate. Additionally, we see room for growth as we expand our content outside of solely Arbitrum core and into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over the next 2 years, we will create more dashboards that cover apps and infra that are well-positioned to support the expansion of the Arbitrum tech stack, with the goal of encouraging more partners to consider an Arbitrum deployment/support.\n\n**Recognition by News Outlets:** We regularly post threads on X and LinkedIn that highlight important initiatives that are ongoing in the Arbitrum DAO, but we do know that we need to expand our reach to maximize our impact. Members of the Entropy team have been quoted in The Block, Blockworks, CoinDesk, Unchained, and Yahoo Finance about our work in Arbitrum on numerous occasions. Additionally, we have represented Arbitrum on a few podcasts. at multiple conferences, and even in an official Arbitrum marketing video. Although we have plenty of room to keep improving our public brand, we are happy with the growth in the first year.\n\n![Entropy Proposal 4.jpg](ipfs://bafybeig3amkztpwwz3zq5m6n34e3g5aob77n4on74q455u62yxjzoilt3m)\n\n**Acknowledgment by Investors:** Large ARB token holders have evidently taken notice of our ability to push forward initiatives, be more critical of each individual spending request, and our focus on ecosystem growth, long-term sustainability, and revenue diversification, which has manifested through our rise in voting power. Our ascension to the top of the [ARB delegates](https://dune.com/queries/4713840/7834608) by voting power is a responsibility we do not take lightly, and is something we are really proud of. In our opinion, this signals to us that we are prioritizing the right things and are in the early stages of helping steward the DAO\u2019s path forward.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Vision for Years 2 and 3\n\nNow that it\u2019s increasingly likely that the DAO\u2019s operational structure will include officially recognized AAEs, the path has been paved for Entropy Advisors to shift our focus more fully toward growth, sustainability, and strategic execution. While the OpCo comes to fruition, Entropy will continue to support operations- and oversight-focused initiatives that require continuity. Topics like administering the ARB Staking Working Group, supporting ARDC v2, leading programs like Watchdog and MSS, and maintaining the Delegate Code of Conduct will likely transition over to OpCo, and we will be here to ensure a smooth handoff. We expect this transition to be ongoing throughout the entirety of 2025, with the operations-related workload easing on Entropy's end by the beginning of 2026.\n\nEntropy Advisors' singular focus over the next two years is to help the Arbitrum DAO mature into a disciplined capital allocator. We will spearhead building an organization that drives compounding, sustainable ecosystem growth.\n\nArbitrum is now positioned to act more like a sovereign wealth fund: managing a composable treasury, deploying capital with strategic intent, and aligning incentives to deepen protocol adoption and ecosystem loyalty. Entropy's work across treasury design and management, incentive architecture, data transparency, and ecosystem relationships will operate in tandem to realize this vision.\n\nThe strategy boils down to:\n\n* Build a high-quality treasury of productive, composable assets (LSTs, T-bills, etc.)\n* Deploy a large share of holdings across DeFi as protocol-owned liquidity to generate yield, support aligned builders, and establish Arbitrum leverage. This function will also help onboard new partners, as the DAO will act as an initial source of demand\n* Layer in structured, app-agnostic incentives (DRIP) to attract usage and reinforce protocol alignment\n* Use analytics and reporting to increase visibility, optimize decision-making, and build external trust\n* Leverage relationships and special projects to scale adoption, reinforce values, and extend reach\n\nIn short, we stop throwing darts at the wall and start **designing growth**: capital-efficient, data-informed, and strategically aligned.\n\nOur high-level objectives to achieve the above strategy are as follows, with more details in each deliverable section below:\n\n* Smooth handover to OpCo of DAO operations- and communications-related tasks, while filling the gaps in the interim as needed.\n* Maximize the number of dapps and RWAs that \u201ccall Arbitrum Home\u201d by designing treasury management and incentive programs that support BD efforts. Bolster this through data analytics support as a white glove services offering.\n* Formalize the DAO\u2019s financial processes, optimize and introduce revenue streams, ensure AEP licensing fees are paid and idle non-native assets are put to work in DeFi in accordance with portfolio management policies, and continually monitor key protocol revenue drivers like Timeboost and the transaction fee mechanism.\n* Professionalize and iterate on various areas within the Arbitrum DAO, such as the early-stage support funnel or data transparency, by altering their structures and implementing custom front ends.\n\n**Ultimately, our primary goal through 2027 is to make Arbitrum the leading tech stack for builders, institutions, innovators, and users alike; powered by a sustainable flywheel of compounding growth leading to value generation.**\n\n### Financial Planning, Analysis, and Guiding Capital Deployment\n\nEntropy will work closely with AAEs, vendors, and ecosystem teams to build out the DAO\u2019s core financial infrastructure. We believe that the long-term viability of the Arbitrum DAO hinges on prudent asset management, disciplined budgeting, and strategic cash flow deployment to generate additional income, compound growth, and deepen our ecosystem\u2019s liquidity while supporting integral builders. It\u2019s worth emphasizing that while we work on financially sound structures, growth will always be at the forefront of our work in the ecosystem.\n\nOur responsibilities here will include:\n\n* Tracking and consolidating key financial figures, including revenue sources (AEP Licensing Fees, Timeboost, Transaction Fees, Treasury Management activity, and others that may arise), the DAO\u2019s assets/liabilities, as well as realized expenses to set up and maintain in-depth financial statements.\n* Building models to project DAO financials and scenario-plan various budget configurations.\n* Providing recommendations for capital allocation, including ecosystem-growth targeting activities, income-generating initiatives, cost-cutting opportunities, and diversified treasury strategies.\n* Procuring service providers and conducting outreach to protocols for initiatives classified under the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council (GMC, TMC, STEP)\n* Supporting the DAO with real-time, bespoke financial dashboards, posting quarterly DAO financial reports to the forum, and ensuring the proper risk analysis measures are in place. This reporting will take place across all of the DAO\u2019s financial and asset-allocation activity, including the assets that currently fall under STEP, TMC, GMC, and other future initiatives.\n* Working cross-functionally with all of the AAEs to create aligned, sustainable cross-functional capital deployment plans across the DAO\u2019s initiatives.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to provide the DAO with the tools, data, and guidance necessary to fund innovation responsibly, while positioning Arbitrum to be financially self-sustaining over the coming years.\n\n### Incentives\n\nWe believe incentives will play a major role in Arbitrum's next phase of growth, especially given the increased attention on dapp performance and ecosystem competitiveness. Our team will build upon the groundwork laid in the DRIP proposal to establish a long-term incentives strategy.\n\nKey areas of focus:\n\n* Continue leading incentive design frameworks, being the main party responsible for the success of approved programs\n* Draft and refine incentive programs, ensuring data-driven optimization throughout the programs\u2019 lifecycle and that low-return programs are swiftly discontinued\n* Work with ecosystem teams (dApps, infra, new deployments) to scope incentive programs that accelerate high-growth opportunities sustainably.\n* Facilitate real-time data for the DAO to follow the progress of incentive programs, analyze the effectiveness of implemented programs, and deliver actionable feedback loops to improve upon them.\n* Interface with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure growth programs run by the aforementioned entities and the DAO are synergistic.\n\nEntropy\u2019s goal is to bring structure and discipline to a chaotic incentives landscape. We see ourselves as the party relentlessly focused on continuous iteration, eliminating inefficiencies, and driving outcomes.\n\n### Ecosystem Data\n\nWe plan to double down on our ecosystem data work, expanding the scope and sophistication of our analytics to support every aspect of DAO decision making, while also serving as a protocol support mechanism that endorses native builders and attracts new builders, with the added benefit of increasing the ecosystem\u2019s social presence. Both of the prior-listed roles around treasury management and incentives include analytics, but the data team will have an expanded scope outside of these 2 already time-intensive categories.\n\nKey priorities:\n\n* Continue building world-class dashboards and reports for delegates, investors, and DAO programs across all verticals.\n* Expand to more dapp-specific dashboards that showcase usage, traction, and ecosystem synergies in an effort to attract new protocols to Arbitrum while also supporting existing ones. These same efforts will apply to significant Orbit chain deployments.\n* Assist partners like OCL, the AF, and OpCo with analytics that track protocol upgrades, monitor the health of the network, and/or help track operational metrics. OCL, the AF, and other key stakeholders have already regularly reached out to Entropy for help with custom analytics, and we would love to continue this work.\n* Provide Entropy\u2019s data infrastructure as a core asset for both internal DAO operations and external ecosystem engagement. Ideally, this will have its own custom Arbitrum-branded front-end rather than simply living on Dune.\n* Support institutions (e.g., TradFi managers) with data services (e.g., analytics for managers\u2019 tokenized RWAs live on Arbitrum One) to strengthen the DAO\u2019s relationship with them and to help establish Arbitrum One as the prioritized destination for institutions\u2019 future initiatives.\n* Analytics around incentives and treasury management, outlined in prior sections of this proposal.\n* Handle ad hoc data needs as they arise. A concrete example of this includes our [Security Council](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-security-council) dashboard, which was created quickly to support the election process.\n\nBased on our experience, utilizing data services as a BD and support tool is an extremely powerful way to attract and entrench new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Providing these types of services is a valuable opportunity for Arbitrum to expand its brand reach and, as we\u2019ve observed, having the ability to offer white glove treatment increases the likelihood of capturing interest from top-tier institutions and builders. Having said that, these white glow services are highly time-consuming on average, and under no circumstances do we want to divert our teams\u2019 capacity away from facilitating initiatives that directly benefit the DAO without the certainty of conversion. Given these circumstances, there may be certain projects that are complementary to Arbitrum and are deemed as high potential for the ecosystem. In these cases, it may make sense to ramp up project-specific capacity and thus support the ecosystem both directly through ecosystem-focused efforts and indirectly through BD-related data services. In these scenarios, the Arbitrum Foundation will have the ability to waive Entropy\u2019s exclusivity on a case-by-case basis.\n\nEntropy Data will be the connective tissue that powers smarter treasury decisions, sharper incentives, and more compelling narratives, while serving as a support mechanism for builders, institutions, and partners entering the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Special Projects\n\nEntropy Advisors will continue to act as a neutral strategic arm and flexible generalist operator for the DAO, identifying high-impact and ad hoc initiatives that fall outside traditional workstreams or require a novel approach. These are the thorny, under-owned, cross-functional, and/or politically sensitive deliverables that the DAO may struggle to tackle without a coordinated, trusted group stepping in. In many cases, the OpCo will be best suited to pick up some of this work with regard to occasional operational requirements, but given Entropy\u2019s team composition, we may be best positioned for certain tasks based on our existing skillsets and relationships.\n\nExamples of special projects include:\n\n* Represent the Arbitrum DAO, when deemed appropriate by OCL or the AF, when dealing with external protocols that are considering deployments on the Arbitrum tech stack (similar to our involvement in the Ethena X Securitize deal to launch Converge on Orbit). Note that we\u2019ve acted in a similar role several times throughout our initial term.\n* Help educate traditional financial institutions, typically those who reach out with interest in STEP, on the shortcomings of current tokenized RWA designs and opportunities when it comes to ecosystem integrations, and offer our time and DeFi-nativity to inform upcoming product launches in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Work with relevant partners to enable DAO-owned products that can diversify the DAO\u2019s revenue streams in tandem with improving the user experience on Arbitrum.\n* Attend high-profile conferences and take on speaking opportunities to spread the Arbitrum brand. We will also continue to host \u201cdelegate days\u201d in an effort to align key stakeholders.\n* Iterate on Arbitrum DAO\u2019s early-stage support structure by bringing in talent and making it a more professional and cohesive experience that affords the DAO upside in the projects it helps get off the ground.\n* Miscellaneous projects as opportunities arise.\n\nWe will remain flexible in this vertical, focusing on initiatives that drive high strategic value but may lack an existing home within the DAO\u2019s organizational structure. It may be necessary to approve ideas that Entropy will take on via a DAO vote if these initiatives require excess budgets beyond what Entropy itself can afford.\n\n### Termination Clause and Transparency Pledge\n\nThe DAO naturally retains the option to terminate this agreement through a standard forum \u2192 Snapshot process, requiring 3% of the votable token supply to vote in favor of the termination. Quarterly transparency reports will be directly shared with the Arbitrum Foundation at their request, which will have the ability to move a forum post forward with the same structure for termination. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment from accruing at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked (but unearned) for Entropy Advisors\u2019 future base payments and the remaining funds of the 10M ARB set aside for incentive alignment will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation. \n\nOnce the OpCo has been sufficiently operationalized, Entropy Advisors will operate under the assumption that OpCo will be Entropy\u2019s counterparty that will represent the DAO and act as its proxy. Moreover, we will continue sharing monthly updates with the DAO.\n\n# Overall Costs\n\n## Budget\n\nAfter reaching out to some larger delegates and key stakeholders to get feedback on how Entropy Advisors should proceed forward, it has become clear that a 2-year term mandate is desired to ensure alignment over a sufficient period of time in order to accomplish the aforementioned goals. Therefore, we are proposing to work with the Arbitrum DAO for 2 years from September 1st 2025 through August 31st 2027. We propose a base pay of $3M per year, a ~$500k per year increase versus our first term, as we have ambitions to grow the team to internalize key functions related to data, incentives, and treasury management.\n\nIn addition to our base pay, and in an effort to achieve long-term alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem, we propose a 5M ARB allocation to Entropy Advisors that will be locked in a vesting contract with a 1-year cliff and 3-year vest. In addition to the 5M ARB allocation, 10M ARB will be set aside for the OAT to negotiate directly with Entropy Advisors on establishing short, medium, and long-term incentive mechanisms. These mechanisms may include, but not be limited to, milestone-based payments, an equity investment into Entropy Advisors, bonuses related to Entropy exceeding expectations, etc. The Arbitrum Foundation will custody this 10M ARB, and must adhere to any agreement made between the OAT and Entropy Advisors. It is also worth noting that any terms related to an equity investment may fall under NDA. Our goal is to ensure the entire Entropy Advisors team has a large incentive to see Arbitrum win, and to ensure we remain committed to Arbitrum significantly into the future. It is also our goal to ensure the Arbitrum DAO can hedge its exposure to Entropy Advisors and enjoy the benefits of its future growth.\n\nIn total, we are requesting the transfer of $6M in ARB (covering 2 years) + a 100% buffer + 15M ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation. $6M worth of ARB will be liquidated immediately upon the passing of this proposal on Tally. 5M ARB will be put into a vesting contract by the Arbitrum Foundation in accordance with the vest above and 10M ARB to remain in custody of the Foundation for the OAT / Entropy alignment mechanisms. The remainder of the funds will be returned to the DAO treasury immediately thereafter. The vesting contract cliff will begin on September 1, 2025, regardless of the timing the actual vesting contract is launched (backdated if needed).\n\nThe Entropy Team will be eligible to claim regular monthly payments of $250,000 from the Arbitrum Foundation throughout the 24-month term. Payments that have accrued can be claimed at any time. If the DAO passes a Snapshot to end its engagement with Entropy Advisors, it will be considered binding on the final day of the same month it passes, and Entropy will be ineligible to accrue any further payments.\n\nWe are nullifying the terms in our Year 1 engagement proposal that stipulate the DAO will vote on a bonus for the first year of our services, and instead replace it with this structure. The ARB allocated as a potential bonus that is in the AF\u2019s possession related to our first engagement should be repurposed at the Foundation\u2019s discretion to cover this engagement proposal, or be returned to the DAO treasury if not required to do so. It is also important to note that Entropy Advisors did not claim the full $205,834 monthly allotments from the first engagement proposal for the first 4 months of service, so the Arbitrum Foundation should have ~$423,336 of additional funds slated to be returned to the DAO. However, we propose allowing the Arbitrum Foundation to use these additional funds to cover a portion of Entropy\u2019s next 2 year engagement (assuming this proposal passes) to minimize ARB sales if it wishes to do so.\n\nEntropy will be abstaining from voting on this proposal due to a clear COI. We look forward to the opportunity of continuing our work in the Arbitrum DAO over the coming years. Entropy Advisors is all-in on Arbitrum, and we look forward to winning together.\n\n## Targeted Timeline\n\n* Forum Discussion: 2 weeks\n* Snapshot Period: 1 week\n* Pre-Tally Discussion: 1 week\n* Tally: ~3 weeks\n* If passed, 2nd mandate initiated: September 1, 2025", "match_confidence": 0.9014, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "412e66e5-a7ff-4833-8000-50ae6e813daa", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x70a8c246bff9f2c9ca73208fd5ce0411086e6d899a46895336617793978e99ff", "title": "DefiEdge STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x70a8c246bff9f2c9ca73208fd5ce0411086e6d899a46895336617793978e99ff", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [144657702.47682208, 8365088.129998528, 1887997.8859994651], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.298", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

The elections will follow the shielded voting standards described [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/updates-to-the-arbitrum-daos-procedures/27762).\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs part of the approved process, an election should be conducted for the DAO to fill the Technical Expert role, who will play a significant role in operationalizing the Audit Program. The role is a paid position ($5k per month) and the expected workload is estimated at ~1-2 days per week.\n\nThe Technical Expert will be responsible for:\n\n* Reviewing audit reports submitted by external auditors, assessing the validity and accuracy of their findings.\n* Providing technical guidance and support to the Audit Committee in reviewing the applicants and the audit firms.\n* Assessing the complexity of the audits and helping in the matching between applicants and audit firms.\n\nThe following criteria were used to evaluate and shortlist the candidates:\n\n* Strong Solidity knowledge with a nice-to-have on Viper, Stylus, and/or Rust knowledge.\n* Deep understanding of blockchain security principles and common vulnerability patterns.\n* Excellent communication skills, with the ability to clearly articulate technical findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.\n* Familiarity with the Arbitrum ecosystem, including its architecture and tooling.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation, acting in its capacity as chair of the Audit Committee, has shortlisted the following two candidates out of 68 candidates for the technical expert position, Gustavo Grieco and Andrei Andonov, alongside candidate-provided bios.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n### Gustavo Grieco\n\n#### Introduction\n*Hi, I\u2019m Gustavo Grieco ([GitHub](https://gustavo-grieco.github.io/)), a freelance blockchain security engineer. I spent about eight years at Trail of Bits (TOB) working on a wide range of blockchain security projects, dedicating a significant portion of that time to reviewing the Arbitrum stack.*\n\n#### Background\n*This included deep technical audits across several versions of the protocol, from the original Arbitrum Classic to Nitro and, more recently, Stylus. Alongside Arbitrum, I also audited various DeFi applications such as stablecoins, lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, wallets, and other core blockchain infrastructure.*\n\n##### Experience\n*I tend to keep a low profile and focus on the technical side, but I place a strong emphasis on clear communication, especially in audit reports. As a Principal Security Engineer at TOB, I was involved not only in hands-on code reviews but also in audit planning. This included defining scopes, estimating effort, selecting tools, and ensuring findings were presented with the right balance of technical depth and clarity for non-technical readers. I also participated in early-stage client discussions, which gave me a solid understanding of how audit needs evolve throughout a project\u2019s lifecycle.*\n\n#### Role at Arbitrum Audit Program\n*For this role, I will bring:*\n\n* *Thorough evaluation of audit reports submitted by external auditors to verify the accuracy and relevance of their findings*\n* *Practical and transparent guidelines for evaluating and ranking companies, individuals, or projects applying to the Arbitrum Audit Program*\n* *A strong commitment to operational security to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the process*\n* *To maintain independence and continuously improve my skills, I am currently unaffiliated with any company or organization and am focusing on advancing smart contract security tools, particularly in fuzzing and symbolic execution.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n### Andrei Andonov\n\n#### Introduction\n*Hey everyone, I\u2019m Andrei ([@iamandreiski](https://x.com/iamandreiski)), and I have been part of the crypto space since 2017, and professionally since 2020. After various non-tech crypto roles, I pivoted to smart contract security in late 2023, working on keeping the Ethereum ecosystem safe \u2014 as my fundamental belief is that security is crucial for crypto\u2019s future and the onboarding of new users and capital.*\n\n#### Background\n*I bring a strong public track record as a Security Researcher, with 10+ Top-5 finishes in public audit contests, and 50+ audits. Prior to the current role, I led teams, processes and operations as a Head of Knowledge Management at Crypto.com, as well as other project management engagements.*\n\n#### Experience\n*In the spirit of transparency and showcasing my technical and research skills, as well as contributing towards ecosystem security, I\u2019ve competed in numerous public audit contests. My public portfolio encompasses:*\n\n* *100+ Critical/High/Medium vulnerabilities*\n* *2 x first places, with 10+ top-5 placements*\n* *Numerous types of projects including, but not limited to: Stablecoins, Cross-Chain integrations, Liquid staking protocols, AMMs, Bridges, L2s, etc.*\n* *More information regarding contest highlights can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/iamandreiski), as well as links to my profiles on platforms such as Sherlock, Cantina, CodeHawks, etc.*\n\n#### Role at Arbitrum Audit Program\n*I\u2019ve spent time on both sides of the fence - scaling dev/operations teams and diving deep into security research - so I bring a unique perspective to the table.*\n\n*My security research experience, coupled with overseeing many projects enables me to evaluate a codebase\u2019s maturity, potential risks, audit findings, and the overall state of the project/product. And second, through my participation in audit contests and bug bounties, I\u2019ve gained insights into various audit companies, practices, as well as how this market operates. With all of the above, I can ensure protocols are well-prepared for audits, optimizing resource use. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to contribute to the Arbitrum Audit Program and strengthen its ecosystem.*\n\n# Timeline\n\n1. June 19th: Proposal is posted to the forum.\n2.

The[ STIP Backfund proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-to-backfund-successful-stip-proposals-savvy-dao-final/19046) was introduced to fund all the STIP applications that were approved but were not funded because the budget ran out. The distribution for STIP and Backfund incentives was extended to March 2024, while the[ Long Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223) was introduced in December 2023 and was poised to run from January 2024 to April 2024. Lastly, the [STIP-Bridge](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353) proposal was meant to mitigate the \u2018unfair\u2019 advantage that protocols distributing incentives from LTIPP would have over those distributing incentives from STIP & Backfund after the latter programs had expired.\n\nAnyone who followed the discussions around the different proposals and programs is familiar with the fact that time constraints played a significant role in why we didn\u2019t stop to analyze the data collected and iterate based on that. We needed to maintain momentum and remain competitive with other L2s, especially while the market was overall bullish.\n\nThings have changed over the past few months, and the need for an incentive program that accounts for all the data that we have collected through the past programs has become apparent. Our proposal is a social agreement (we will post a temperature check vote on Snapshot, but there will be no on-chain proposal) to use the three months following the conclusion of LTIPP and STIP Bridge explicitly to reflect on the learnings, design and refine a program based on them, and consider the feedback of key stakeholders.\n\nWe know incentives are vital to protocol and ecosystem growth in crypto, and we want to help create a perpetual program that leverages incentives efficiently to have the biggest positive impact on the protocols receiving them.\n\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nThere are already hundreds of data points to review, analyze, and ultimately distill into actionable insights on what works and what doesn\u2019t regarding incentives. From professionally carried out analysis to opinion-article style posts in the forums from stakeholders close to the DAO and the incentive programs themselves, here is a non-exhaustive list of information to use (in chronological order):\n\n\n\n* **[Proposal to Improve Future Incentive Programs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-to-improve-future-incentive-programs/18948)**\n* **[Discussion: Reframing Incentives on Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/discussion-reframing-incentives-on-arbitrum/19817)**\n* **[Serious People: Proposed KPIs for Arbitrum Grant Programs (LTIPP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/serious-people-proposed-kpis-for-arbitrum-grant-programs-ltipp/20416)**\n* **[A New Thesis for Network-Level Incentives Programs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757)**\n* **[Learnings from STIP: Community Interview Summaries and Notes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/learnings-from-stip-community-interview-summaries-and-notes/20916)**\n* **[STIP Analysis (ARDC Research Deliverables)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-research-deliverables/23438)**\n* **[OpenBlock\u2019s STIP Incentive Efficacy Analysis](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblocks-stip-incentive-efficacy-analysis/23687)**\n* **[[RFC] Thoughts on the End-Game Perpetual Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-thoughts-on-the-end-game-perpetual-incentives-program/23720)**\n* **[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/arbitrum-research-development-committee-ardc/risk-member/33)**\n* **[Memories of a (grantor) cow: thoughts about incentives program and what could be next](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/memories-of-a-grantor-cow-thoughts-about-incentives-program-and-what-could-be-next/25406)**\n* [**Research Bounty Selections](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/research-bounty-selections/25012) (to be completed)**\n* **[The ARC\u2019s vision of historical incentive programs and its future](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasure-delegate-communication-thread/18873/22)**\n\nBefore we embark on another incentive program, we should try to incorporate the culmination of all the learnings from the above posts (and others I might have missed) into the design process.\n\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThe proposal will be submitted to Snapshot a week after this forum post. If it successfully passes temp-check, the proposed 3-month break from incentive programs will begin on September 17th, given that the LTIPP and STIP Bridge incentive distribution timeframes conclude on September 2nd and September 16th, respectively.\n\nWithin 2 weeks of a successful temp-check, we will facilitate the revival of the incentives working group and invite delegates, researchers who have conducted analysis, protocol builders, and other relevant stakeholders to participate in the working group.\n\nL2BEAT does not wish to lead the working group; we\u2019d instead prefer to facilitate its creation and then step back and participate as delegates by providing our feedback and opinions. However, we commit to remaining active in the working group and helping drive the discussion forward.\n\nOnce the working group has been formed, it should regularly meet and work towards designing an incentive program that accounts for as many of the insights we\u2019ve gathered as possible without sacrificing operational efficiency and introducing too many complicated and unnecessary structures.\n\n\n### **Steps to implement**\n\n\n\n1. This RFC collects feedback and goes to Snapshot.\n2. The proposal passes Snapshot successfully.\n3. We \u2018revive\u2019 the incentives working group and invite all relevant stakeholders to participate.\n4. We collectively start designing and refining a long-term incentives program based on all the gathered data.\n5. On September 17th, the 3-month incentives break period begins.\n6. Ideally, by the conclusion of the 3-months break, we will be able to transform the design into an actionable program that can be submitted to the DAO as a proposal.\n7. [Optional] If 6 doesn\u2019t come from the working group itself, then we should at least create an overview of principles any future incentive program must consider to be considered by the DAO.\n\n\n### **Timeline**\n\nThe proposed timeline for the incentives detox is 3 months. If involved parties feel that more time is needed to design an incentive program that is as comprehensive as possible, then the timeline can be extended as needed without an additional vote.\n\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere is no cost associated with the execution of this AIP.", "match_confidence": 0.7397, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "42c1db4c-c94c-4657-9d08-516f3119a837", "proposal_id": "0593649d-0b8c-4724-9ba1-6adda1d38593", "snapshot_id": "0xf49d88ec2f4fa7373efc66a7cf9441d916519f48a2d90e7db3ea688357150a44", "title": "Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the \u2018Arbitrum Research & Development Collective", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf49d88ec2f4fa7373efc66a7cf9441d916519f48a2d90e7db3ea688357150a44", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-12-11 17:36:09", "voting_end": "2023-12-18 17:36:09", "options": {"scores": [31531751.957894463, 0, 66389979.15911178, 27012590.231747206, 0], "choices": ["Fund with 880,000 ARB", "Fund with 1,300,000 ARB", "Fund with 1,715,000 ARB", "Don't fund", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-12-18 17:36:09", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.9", "body": "**Please see the link to the forum discussion for the full text of this proposal**\n\n**Abstract** - This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members\u2019 ideas into reality for a term of 6 months. \n\n**Motivation** - The ARDC's role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Furthermore, we like that they will also be attempting to migrate their native governance token. \nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe applicant presents a plan that is both simple in execution and easy to monitor. Staked ETH also should be a priority for Arbitrum, as it is a quality, yield-bearing asset, thereby creating a capital flow from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Despite the high request size, we feel the potential gains for Arbitrum outweigh the price tag. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nUnclear if they intend to support native minting as many other liquid derivatives have offered which greatly simplified the process of onboarding capital and continues to reinforce Arbitrum as a primary hub.  The fact that the only reference was a small bridged amount of osETH (via presumably the canonical bridge) makes it seem unlikely; 40% of the incentives are going to incentivize their own native token (it is an 80:20 balancer token so that is potentially still contributing more so to osETH liquidity but again it seems a less productive use of the proceeds for building protocol usage and more towards their token.  Would have been better to see these amounts go towards alternative uses.\n\nThe majority of the funds will be used to incentivize their own liquidity pool to deepen liquidity of the osETH/SWISE market and try and bring osETH from mainnet to Arbitrum. The grant size is large and I struggle to see how deep liquidity they may build with osETH will continue once the incentives end. I fail to see how incentivizing their own token liquidity will have a long lasting impact on the DAO and be a good return on investment.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Stakewise's proposal.\n\nDetailed proposal that scored well in the rubric, namely re: stickiness to retain liquidity post-LTIPP and matching from Stakewise. Growing Arbitrum's share re: staked ETH is important and they've signalled a clear intention to align themselves with Arbitrum over the long term with the migration plans and incentives. The incentive mechanism is pretty straightforward re: liquidity mining. It's a large requested grant size relative to Arbitrum adoption/market demand and would have liked to see greater granularity + detail behind the milestones/timelines to match the stated KPIs, as well as the early start to a move into Arbitrum prior to LTIPP.

In 2022 alone, DeFi experienced hacks resulting in losses of over $3.1B. In 2023, a staggering $2.3B has already been stolen, indicating a trajectory higher than the previous year.\n\nThis is a security problem, a best practices problem, and a branding problem - rightfully keeping away institutions and users from a world-changing technology.

Through this proposal, Cyfrin aims to contribute to the long-term success of the Arbitrum ecosystem through attracting incoming TVL for the Arbitrum ecosystem, gain user trust, and show traction to potential future investors.\n\nLaser-focused on Web3 security, Cyfrin is a market leader in smart contract audits.

Competitive with the best of the firms.\" - 0xmons from Sudorandom Labs\n\nThrough this proposal, we\u2019re asking Arbitrum to fund a Security Enhancement Fund to audit projects built on its infrastructure. The fund will allocate funds to private, competitive, or multi-phase audits for projects built on Arbitrum.\n\nCyfrin will power the long-term success of Arbitrum protocols, so protocols feel safer going to market and users more comfortable interacting with the Arbitrum chain.\n\n## Key Terms\nAudit: An audit is a service where a security researcher reviews a codebase in depth with the intent of finding potential vectors for exploitation. Once completed, a report is presented to the protocol to fix any potential vulnerabilities found.\n\nPrivate audit: A team, consisting of usually 2-3 security researchers, spends weeks looking at a protocol\u2019s codebase with the aim of finding the most critical exploit vectors in a codebase, as well as perform architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, etc.\n\nPublic Competitive Audit: An audit where hundreds, if not thousands, of security researchers review a codebase and compete for funds in a set reward pool based on the complexity of vulnerabilities found, its impact, and its uniqueness.\n\nPrivate Competitive Audit: An invite-only audit where a protocol invites top-performing auditors to review their code and compete in community driven audit competition.\n\nMulti-Phase Audit: a new, innovative model known as the Diverge-Converge Multi-Phase Model. Crafted to maximize the quality of audits, a critical aspect in the Web3 space, by strategically incentivizing auditors and ensuring that the protocol codebase goes through at least three comprehensive auditing phases, enhancing the protocol\u2019s ultimate security.\n\n## Specifications\nThe entirety of the funds will be allocated towards funding security reviews for protocols, including the costs to run the audits, hire auditors, promote contests, bring judges, do customer support, and competition moderation.\n\nThe Fund will match up to 60% for the audit requested. The remaining amount will have to be paid by the project itself requesting for funding. This is mostly to weed out projects just looking for a free audit, ensuring we\u2019re truly enabling long-lasting impact for the ecosystem.\n\nThe one exception to this rule is projects who are already deployed on Arbitrum and who can prove a high number of active users, total value locked, or who provide user retention and stickiness across the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole. Establishing the details of what \u201chigh\u201d means in this case will be a task of the Allocation Committee once formed.\n\nThese audits may come in the form of competitive audits, through our CodeHawks platform, private audits through our security research team, or through our multi-phased approach combining the above.\n\n## Audit Types\nCompetitive Audits\nCodeHawks, one of the leading competitive auditing platforms in the market and home to some of the top security experts in the industry, enhances the security of protocols through community-driven smart contract security reviews.\n\nOn CodeHawks, hundreds of auditors study, test, stress, and review the same protocol\u2019s codebase for a defined amount of time - finding bugs and potential exploit vectors. Auditors then submit the findings to the platform for judge review and monetizing based on the vulnerabilities uncovered.\n\nPrivate Audits\nPrivate audits, an option tailored to yet-to-be deployed, and already-live protocols. A hand-in-hand relationship between protocol\u2019s engineering team and our security research squad is formalized to uncover vulnerabilities and support developers with state-of-the-art best practices guidance.\n\nThrough constant communication, the protocol\u2019s engineering team is able to revise vulnerabilities as soon as they\u2019re found - ensuring the team can start working on fixes immediately. Auditors also provide architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, specific knowledge like formal verification, code smells, testing feedback, etc.\n\nMulti-phase Audits\nDesigned for large and more complex protocols, the Multi-Phase audit approach has the stronger security guarantee of them all since it encourages the protocol to go through several audit phases before completing the final report.\n\nTo learn more about the Multi-Phase Audits, review here. \n\n![94de3d610083fec1fdc4d0cd35c1720832865f5b.png](ipfs://bafkreiauxpn2v4ymg4djs22mshbdtzucp73zr62byswrmto5dzr7fzqloq)\n\n## Allocation Committee\nThe Allocation Committee is the group responsible for determining which projects should receive audit funding. Cyfrin will lead the charge of setting this Committee up within 2 weeks of proposal approval.\n\nThe multisig account for the Allocation Committee will contain 5 people (3 from Arbitrum\u2019s side, 2 from Cyfrin). Each team (Cyfrin and Arbitrum) will select who from their organizations will represent them in the Allocation Committee within 10 days of proposal approval.\n\nOnce composed, the committee will determine any additional eligibility criteria and share them with the community before opening up the application funnel. The application funnel should open within a maximum of one month post proposal approval.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee is responsible for defining the appropriate application process and reviewing applications on a recurrent basis. The process for reviewing these applications, as well as how often the Committee meets will be determined by the members based on the amount of applications received and their complexity.\n\nWe saw the community gather together under the STIP proposal and would like the same community participatory process to guide the direction of how the fund allocates the distribution. It\u2019s a discovery process that we will run, partnering with Arbitrum to validate findings and iterate repeatedly.\n\n## Eligibility criteria for protocols applying to the Security Enhancement Fund\nThe Security Enhancement Fund aims at improving the security of all projects that have already deployed or will be deploying into the Arbitrum chain.\n\nAny protocol that adds value to the Arbitrum ecosystem across DeFi, Gaming, DAOs, or social projects, real world assets tokenization, track and trace solutions, or any other track, bringing a healthy and sustainable contribution to the ecosystem, is welcomed to apply.\n\nProjects should have already deployed to Arbitrum mainnet to apply, although exceptions can be made for:\n\nProtocols who commit to deploying on Arbitrum within 6 months of the audit - if this is the case, the code being audited must be deployed exclusively on Arbitrum for 6 months before launching elsewhere. The Allocation Committee will determine when taking such a risk is worth the assessment.\n\nProtocols who already have deployed and gained traction on other chains, looking to deploy to Arbitrum as well - if this is the case, information regarding the protocol\u2019s TVL, active user base, and Arbitrum strategy should be shared in the application for review by the Allocation Committee.\n\n## Ineligible Projects\nIn an effort to keep the Arbitrum ecosystem secure and sustainable, we comply and leverage Arbitrum\u2019s guidelines 2 to determine which projects are ineligible to apply for the Security Enhancement Fund.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee may establish additional guidelines for ineligible projects.\n\n## Security Enhancement Fund Distribution\nThe 100% of the funds from the Security Enhancement Fund will be used to audit Arbitrum projects.\n\nThe fund allocation per project will cover 60% of the protocol audit, expecting the protocol to cover the rest. The reasoning behind this is to ensure only protocols serious about their long-term growth get audited. However, an exception of sponsoring 80% of the audit could be made for unique situations as established by the Allocation Committee, like for a protocol amounting for large ecosystem growth or a large protocol deploying to Arbitrum.\n\nThis makes it extremely convenient for protocols built on Arbitrum to enhance the security of their codebase and protect users\u2019 assets.\n\nAudit prices are aligned with industry standards and calculated based on the complexity of the codebase under review.\n\nFor competitive audits, the prize pool is calculated as approximately $30 multiplied by the number of lines of code in the code base.\n\nFor private audits, the cost is calculated as $60,000 multiplied by the number of weeks required by the auditors to read, understand, and review the code base in scope. The time required for each audit is evaluated before the security review by the lead auditor assigned to the project and will be made publicly available to the community.\n\nProtocols are permitted to undergo one or multiple smart contract security reviews per protocol update. The number of reviews is determined based on the codebase size, as indicated below:\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with less than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 1 per type.\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with more than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 2 per type.\n\nnSloc is an objective measure and industry that stands for Normalized Source Code. Calculated reducing all multiline functions declarations to a single line, removing all comments and empty lines and counting the remaining number of lines of code.\n\nWhatever allocation we don\u2019t spend, at the end of the year we will return to the DAO for further use.\n\n## Steps to implement\nWithin the next year, the Cyfrin team commits to:\n\n1. Technical implementation of creating the Allocation Committee\u2019s multisig and define its members\n2. Allocation Committee details eligibility requirements and allocation criteria\n3. Define and implement process for protocols to apply for audits alongside the Allocation Committee\n4. Review applications and start distributing funds strategically for protocols who meet the criteria\n5. Pair auditors with protocols\n6. Kick-off auditing process\n7. Amplify the Security Enhancement Fund as a great reason for projects to choose Arbitrum as their L2 of choice, as well as promotion of the protocols Cyfrin audits\n8. Final report to protocols\n\n\u2013 Keep in mind, this process may vary depending on whether the protocol is undergoing a private, competitive or multi-phase audit.\n\n## Team\nPatrick Collins: Cyfrin\u2019s CEO and former Lead of Chainlink DevRel, Patrick revolutionized the industry onboarding hundreds of thousands of developers into web3 with its courses and speeches, with more than 3 million views on his courses and ~160.000 subscribers across platforms.\n\nAlex Roan: Cyfrin\u2019s CTO, Alex is a veteran Web3 developer who has contributed to core DeFi infrastructure such as Chainlink and Compound - securing billions of dollars in value.\n\nHans Friese: Cyfrin Lead Auditor and Co-founder, Hans is one of the world\u2019s top auditors, consistently ranking at the top within competitive auditor leaderboards 2. He is also the founder and Lead Engineer of Solodit, the most used vulnerability aggregator tool for auditors.\n\nDon Dodge: tech veteran with a past in Google, Microsoft, Groove, Napster, AltaVista, and more. Startup investor, advisor, and board member.\n\nMark Scrine: previously the Strategic Lead for Proof of Reserve at Chainlink Labs and led a number of their biggest integrations. These included protocols such as TUSD, Matrix Port, Avalanche Bridge, BackedFi, and Swell Network.\n\nDeveloper Relations & Marketing: Our industry leading DevRel team will work together with the Arbitrum\u2019s community to promote, educate, and onboard auditors into the Cyfrin ecosystem, advocating for audit quality for protocols. Additionally, through Cyfrin\u2019s Education platform, our DevRel team is brewing the next generation of software engineers into the space with Arbitrum as their L2 of choice. Composed of 6 people total, here\u2019s an example of some of the leaders in our team:\n\nVitto Rivabella, formerly leading Developers Experience at Alchemy, the popular Web3 infrastructure provider, and Alchemy University, educating tens of thousands of Web3 developers. Web3 educator, investor, developer, public speaker and a former VFX supervisor.\n\nJuliette Chevalier, former Lead of Developer Relations at Aragon and Co-founder of Surge Women, an organization bridging the educational gap between women and crypto products. She is also a key contributor to various DAOs, angel investor, software engineer, and public speaker.\n\nCommunity Manager: Our Community Manager will foster peer-to-peer relationships and manage technical support for the students going through the Arbitrum courses - a vital resource for community members seeking assistance and supporting CodeHawks auditors to do their best work.\n\nDesign: Our design team will create visually engaging and user-friendly materials, enhancing the overall learning experience for the Abitrum developer community and CodeHawks auditors.\n\nCodeHawks Team: The CodeHawks team together with Cyfrin will run, promote, judge, support and moderate the competitions and the community, onboarding and assisting the protocols looking to onboard on Arbitrum. Once the team has made sure the protocol respects the eligibility criteria, they will manage the entire cycle from start to finish. This includes sales (answering to active inbounds, and protocols suggested by the community), contest details, marketing, judging, and final report submission.\n\nAudit Team: Our team of security researchers are experts across a variety of fields like DeFi, oracles, Web3 social, and more. They come from the industry\u2019s top auditor leaderboard and are dedicated entirely to the private audits.\n\n## Cost\nThe budget for this proposition totals $2 million.\n\nThe entirety of the funds is dedicated towards the sponsoring of audits for protocols deployed or deploying on Arbitrum.\n\nThe entirety of the funds will be expected upon proposal approval to maintain a rapid response to audit requests and safeguard protocol integrity.\n\nUpon the onchain approval of the proposal, these funds will be transferred to the Allocation Committee\u2019s multi-sig, as set up by Cyfrin containing the 2 Cyfrin Committee representatives. The multi-sig\u2019s first transaction will then add the 3 Arbitrum representatives before transferring any funds to protocols.\n\nAdditionally, Cyfrin suggests the Allocation Committee reimburses the DAO quarterly in the event that the minimum expected capital for that quarter ($500,000) isn\u2019t spent within that time period. This will also enable a tangible oversight mechanism for the DAO to ensure Cyfrin is doing the expected work.\n\n## Why $2M?\n\nAt an average cost of $60,000, sponsored at 60%, $2M would cover anywhere from 20-25 audits in the span of a year.\n\nAlthough the cost of an audit varies widely based on codebase size, complexity, and audit type, audit prices typically range between $30,000-$100,000, with an average audit being ~$60,000.\n\nAssuming the Fund covers 60% of the audit, $2M are estimated to cover anywhere from 20-25 audits within the span of a year. Additionally, 70% of the fund will be used to cover existing protocols on Abitrum, with the remaining 30% used to cover new protocols launching on the chain.\n\n\u2013 Important to note that in order to have the best possible security for a protocol, projects often go through 2 or more audits - including private and competitive audits. Particularly for complex projects already holding a high TVL, a multi-phase audit is highly advised to decrease the chances of an exploit to an absolute minimum.\n\nConsidering Arbitrum is believed to have 1.2M total commits and over 1,100 Arbitrum repositories, with over 450 active developers, this fund would cover ~10% of Arbitrum\u2019s development.\n\n https://www.developerreport.com/ecosystems/arbitrum\n\n## Framework on payments, reporting, and oversight\n\nCyfrin pledges to publish financial reports to the DAO to uphold transparency and accountability every quarter, outlining expenditure details, audits funded, decisions made, and progress updates. These reports will be posted in the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s forum for the DAO to periodically review.\n\nSnapshot has a maximum character limit.

Should this proposal pass, the new deadline for protocols to distribute ARB to users would be March 29th. 2024. Since backfunded protocols will experience significant delays to the start of their streams, this proposal aims to have backfunded streams continue until March 15th, 2024. These timeline modifications will help to ensure all protocols have enough time to distribute ARB to users.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe [Proposal to Backfund Successful STIP Proposals](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/13413460212244439965325761903593975061091934953503684497413508380387288651335?chart=2) has recently passed quorum on Tally and will soon commence. The backfund proposal was inappropriately dated to end on January 31st, 2024. As it will likely take several weeks for back-funded protocols to pass KYC, this will only leave around 6 weeks for these protocols to distribute 16 weeks' worth of incentives. This extension proposal aims to continue the streams for these protocols until March 15th, 2024, and allow these protocols to continue incentivizing users until March 29th, 2024. This extension will allow these protocols closer to the full 16 weeks to distribute their ARB incentives to users.\n\nAdditionally, due to extreme variations in KYC timing of the original STIP grantees, some protocols were given much shorter timelines to distribute their ARB incentives. This extension proposal also offers the option to extend the STIP deadline to distribute ARB to users until March 29th, 2024. This will ensure all STIP protocols are given adequate time to distribute their ARB. This however will not change their hedgey stream disbursement dates as the multisig has already started these streams.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe grant funds for both STIP and the Backfund proposal are held by the incentives multisig as stated in the two previous proposals. However, these funds belong to the DAO and the multisig has agreed to follow the DAO's directions. This proposal signals to the multisig if the DAO would like to extend the timelines for STIP and the backfund grant. If this proposal passes the multisig will extend the backfunded protocols\u2019 streams to end on March 15th, 2024, and will allow these protocols to continue distributing their ARB to users until March 29th, 2024. Additionally, should the DAO choose, this proposal could signal to the multisig to allow any original STIP protocols to continue distributing incentives to users until March 29th, 2024 without halting their streams.\n\nThese extensions will ensure that protocols\u2019 incentive distributions to users are not rushed. This will help even the playing field for those who took longer to pass KYC. It will allow the DAO to get more accurate data on the success of these programs.\n\n## Key Terms -\n\nSTIP - The full Short Term Incentives program proposal can be seen [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/92535731414466076465748260699234569033779695239254902723866669906112586724812?chart=2)\n\nBackfund Proposal - The full backfund proposal can be seen [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/13413460212244439965325761903593975061091934953503684497413508380387288651335?chart=2)\n\nOriginal Timeline - Originally both STIP and the backfund were to end by January 31st\n\nHedgey Stream Disbursements - The ARB protocols receive biweekly from the multisig\n\nGrant Distributions - The ARB protocols award to users as incentives\n\nIncentives Multisig - The 5/9 multisig that holds the funds for both Incentives programs.

These protocols will also receive disbursements from the multisig using hedgey streams every two weeks.\n\nThe last disbursement date will be March 15th, 2024. Protocols will then have two weeks to finish distributing ARB incentives to users with a deadline of March 29th, 2024.\n\n### Extended STIP Protocol Timeline\n\nProtocols included in the original STIP will have until March 29th, 2024 to finish distributing ARB incentives to users.\n\nThese protocols do not have to extend their distribution schedules until this deadline. Many STIP protocols already have distribution plans in progress that end earlier than March 29th. Protocols may choose to keep their initial plans and finish distributing rewards earlier than March 29th.\n\nProtocols that do wish to extend to the March 29th deadline will be expected to update their distribution plans in their biweekly updates and maintain consistency with their fund usage as expressed in their grant application.\n\nThe hedgey streams for the STIP protocols will not be adjusted as they have already been initiated by the multisig.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nThe multisig would initiate streams for all backfunded protocols to end on March 15th, 2024 given that the backfund proposal passes and these protocols pass KYC and sign grant agreements.\n\nSTIP protocols that wish to adjust their distribution timelines will need to provide updated timelines in their next biweekly update.\n\nBackfunded protocols will also need to provide new distribution schedules that meet the March 29th Deadline.\n\nStableLab will work with the incentives multisig, foundation, protocols, and DAO to help coordinate KYC confirmation, stream initiation, stream monitoring, biweekly updates, and community questions throughout the process.\n\n## Timeline\n\nMarch 15th, 2024 - Backfunded protocols receive their last stream disbursement\n\nMarch 29th, 2024 - Deadline for STIP / backfunded protocols to finish distributing ARB to users\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no additional to cost the DAO associated with this proposal\n\n## Voting Options\n\n1.

Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum\u2019s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.\n\n...\n\n## Motivation\n\nCamelot is not just a DEX - it\u2019s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum\u2019s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple \u2018yield farms\u2019.\n\nIn just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot\u2019s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.\n\nSince then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.\n\nThis grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:\n\n* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.\n\n* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum\u2019s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.\n\n* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.\n\n...\n\n## Rationale\n\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum\u2019s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nSince its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a \u2018yield-farm for mercenary capital,\u2019 and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.\n\nThough past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.\n\nTo allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    \n\n### Ecosystem Builders\n\nCamelot is home to many of Arbitrum\u2019s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot\u2019s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the \u2018Specifications\u2019 section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.\n\n### Integration Partners\n\nBy providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot\u2019s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.\n\n### Core pairs\n\nWhilst Camelot\u2019s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.\n\n### Liquid staked derivatives\n\nLiquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it\u2019s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.\n\n### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent\n\nWhile Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism\u2019s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidwm2wtosajdmpiqyryhwv3wvbrr634fp2zavgebk5z7jjl6igwdu)    \n\nCamelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we\u2019re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome\u2019s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.\n\nTo provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot\u2019s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.\n\n***Camelot TVL, Volume and Fees before ARB Grant***\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflwh7et2aybm4bhk2aunxtlloz6h3yxtxdd4gffgawyhajcno4l4)\n\n...\n\n## Specifications\n\nCamelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. \n\nThe transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month\u2019s incentives are to be distributed.\n\n### Proposal Objectives\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols\n* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements\n* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools\n* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies\n* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme\n\n### Proposal Parameters\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.\n* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).\n* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.\n* The partner integration section has now been merged into the \u201cEcosystem Builders\u201d section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.\n* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.\n\nCamelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:\n\n[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)\n\n* Ecosystem Builders 75%\n  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.\n  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.\n\n* Core Pairs 15%\n  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.\n\n* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%\n  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.\n\nCamelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.\n\n\n...\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nCamelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have \u201cguaranteed\u201d more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.\n\nOnce the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.\n\nMore information on the mechanics of Camelot\u2019s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under \u2018Specifications\u2019.\n\n* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.\n* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.\n* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.\n\n...\n\n## Timeline\n\nCamelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after. The 1.5M ARB will be distributed monthly to the relevant ecosystem multisig mentioned above, for a total of 6 months.\n\nOnce the grant is active, Camelot will provide the subsequent transparency reports no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are to be distributed. The transparency report will follow the template that is attached and will include all relevant information. Following the conclusion of the grant, Camelot will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the grant and its impact.\n\n...\n\n## Overall cost\n\n1,500,000 ARB distributed monthly over 6 months, for a total of 9M ARB tokens.", "match_confidence": 0.9468, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "4a56d674-a59d-4fcc-a141-99c5f254ee54", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xc37793b67f39a6af9e9434003205b1d9b67dd6f75638329045257be823da4f18", "title": "TMC Recommendation", "author_name": "0xb4c064f466931B8d0F637654c916E3F203c46f13", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc37793b67f39a6af9e9434003205b1d9b67dd6f75638329045257be823da4f18", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-03-07 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2025-03-14 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [63734248.24044842, 0, 108812152.75218482, 0, 0], "choices": ["#1 Deploy Both Strategies", "#2 Only Deploy ARB Strategy", "#3 Only Deploy Stable Strategy", "#4 Deploy Nothing", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-03-14 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.283", "body": "TLDR;\n**The TMC recommends that the DAO votes for #3 Only Deploy Stable Strategy**\n\nThe four possible combined outcomes are:\n- **#1 Deploy Both Strategies**\n- **#2 Only Deploy ARB Strategy**\n- **#3 Only Deploy Stable Strategy**\n- **#4 Deploy Nothing**\n- **Abstain**\n\nIf no ARB is deployed (#4 Deploy Nothing, Abstain win), we will make the necessary modifications and resubmit the proposal for another vote. \n\nThe vote will be conducted via Ranked Choice Voting (RCV): Rank options; results use instant-runoff counting.\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe TMC has divided the partner selection into two groups: one for managing the stablecoin allocation\u2014which covers converting ARB tokens to stablecoins and their ongoing management\u2014and one for managing the ARB allocation for on-chain strategies. \n\nSpecifically, the plan is to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage those on-chain, while the remaining 10M ARB is deployed on on-chain ARB-only strategies.\n\nFurther information on the TMC mandate can be found here: [Tally | Arbitrum | Treasury Management V1.2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/111105159609719390908725919603971316574753860587890014819515615630412225940809?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4)\n\n# Shortlisted Proposals\n**Stablecoin Allocation (15M ARB Equivalent)**\n- Scope: This group covers the full process of converting ARB tokens to stablecoins and managing these assets for DAO liquidity needs.\n\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n- Gauntlet\n\n*Allocation Strategy:* The stablecoin management responsibilities will be evenly split among the three partners with a 33/33/33 distribution, ensuring diversification and balanced risk exposure while meeting the conversion and liquidity objectives.\n\n**ARB Allocation (10M ARB)**\n\n- Scope: This group is focused exclusively on deploying 10M ARB tokens into on-chain strategies designed to generate yield while safeguarding the principal.\n\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n\n*Allocation Strategy:* The on-chain ARB strategy will be managed equally by the two partners using a 50/50 split. Their proposals leverage proven DeFi protocols and ecosystem synergies to maximize risk-adjusted returns while maintaining liquidity and principal protection.\n\n\n# TMC Recommendation\nWe recommend a vote of **YES for the Stablecoin Allocation and NO for the ARB Allocation**.\n\nOur analysis shows that the stablecoin strategies presented by the selected partners meet our criteria for DAO alignment, returns, risk management, etc. \n\nWhereas the current ARB proposals lack sufficient risk management and clear operational details\u2014resulting in low yield projections\u2014we believe it is prudent to sit out on this allocation for now.\n\n\n# Voting Outcomes\nPlease cast your vote on each allocation separately. Your options are as follows:\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy Allocation Vote:**\n- **Yes:** Proceed with converting 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage them via a 33/33/33 split among Karpatkey, Avantgarde & Myso, and Gauntlet.\n- **No:** Do not execute the stablecoin strategy; retain current ARB holdings without conversion.\n\n**ARB Strategy Allocation Vote:**\n- **Yes:** Proceed with deploying 10M ARB into on-chain strategies, managed in a 50/50 split between Karpatkey and Avantgarde & Myso.\n- **No:** Do not execute the on-chain strategy; hold the ARB tokens.\n\nThe four possible combined outcomes are:\n- **#1 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// YES deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n- **#2 NO, do not deploy the Stable Strategy /// YES, deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n- **#3 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy**\n- **#4 NO, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy**\n\n**We recommend that the DAO votes for #3 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n\nThe vote will be conducted via Ranked Choice Voting (RCV): Rank options; results use instant-runoff counting.\n\n*Note. The first vote corresponds to the Stablecoin Allocation and the second to the ARB Allocation.*\n\n---\n\n# Other Proposals\nDuring our review process, we evaluated several proposals that ultimately did not meet the criteria, required further clarity, or didn\u2019t align with DAO objectives. \n\n- **AnthiasLabs x XBTO:** Their proposal did not provide adequate detail on stablecoin conversion, DAO alignment, or custody arrangements, which are critical to our objectives.\n\n- **August Digital:** While proposing a single-sided AMM strategy for both ARB yield and ARB-to-USD conversion, the proposal provided minimal details. There was no evidence of existing ARB strategies or a dedicated vault, and the timeline for necessary audits\u2014if smart contracts are involved\u2014was not addressed. Moreover, the risk management section appeared generic, with much of the content seemingly repurposed from other contexts.\n\n- **Bracket Labs:** The submission lacked clarity on key operational components, such as the choice of OTC counterparties or DEXes. Additionally, the rationale behind the 2% trading volume figure and the associated price impact considerations were not explained. Although a Stablecoin Vault is reportedly live, the lack of public transparency and reliance on historical yield figures from related funds (rather than the target vault) were significant concerns, compounded by high fee structures.\n\n- **WINR:** The implementation details were insufficient, leading to concerns over the alignment of risk and reward.\n\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit -- Further Clarification on Shortlisted Rationale\n\n**Stablecoin Strategies:**\nProviders like Karpatkey, Avantgarde/MYSO, and Gauntlet stood out due to their provided backtests, clear execution plans, compensation structure, and risk management frameworks.\n\nWe have high confidence in their ability to execute the conversion of 15M ARB into stablecoins with minimal slippage and market impact.\n\nAs well as deploy these assets in well-established, low-risk protocols\u2014aligned with the intended use of funds. The shortlisted proposals target an average yield of 8% to 12% under varying market conditions while primarily holding USDC and USDT.\n\nThis is why we\u2019re recommending a **YES** vote on the stablecoin allocation.\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit V2 \n**Below is a summary of the strategies, including fees and expected returns. Please refer to the tables for full details and note the associated risks outlined below.**\n\nNote that strategies might share the same general risks, and differences in returns may come down to how effectively the providers optimize yield under varying market conditions.\n\nThere are no guarantees or risk-sharing by the providers. As described below, fees are based on the allocation of assets to each provider and/or their performance.\n\nNote that for the Arbitrum Strategy, while both applicants use Myso they have wildly different reported return profiles (hence different risk profiles).\n\n---\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy**\n\n|Stablecoin Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp.

Although there are some promising elements\u2014for instance, Karpatkey and Avantgarde/MYSO show potential\u2014the ARB strategies did not meet our strict criteria for transparency and risk mitigation. Our internal grading highlighted significant concerns:\n\n* **Lack of Transparency:** Key operational details\u2014such as ARB option liquidity, allocation splits, and execution mechanisms\u2014were either insufficiently detailed or not publicly verifiable, particularly for strategies involving off-chain fund movements.\n* **Inadequate Risk Management:** Given recent security breaches and governance failures across the industry, we believe that preserving the DAO\u2019s capital is a priority. Without a clear risk framework, moving forward with these strategies would introduce unnecessary exposure.\n* **Trade-Offs vs. Returns:** The proposed strategies projected yields between 7% and 30%, depending on the strike price and maturity of options sold, and if the options are sold. If no counterparty is found the options strategy would yield a 0% return. Lending-based strategies offered minimal returns, around 0.16% per year which, even at our maximum allocation, would generate only $10,000\u2013$12,000 annually at current prices. Given the scale of the allocation ($7.5M), these returns do not justify the associated risks.\n\nGiven these trade-offs, we believe the risk is not justified for an allocation of $7.5M worth of assets. Until proposals can deliver fully detailed strategies that meet our risk-adjusted return standards, it\u2019s prudent to vote **NO** for the ARB allocation.\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Alignment Consideration:**\nA key criterion for evaluating submissions was alignment with Arbitrum. While most strategies will be executed on the Arbitrum network, not all will involve Arbitrum native protocols.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this but the main ones are the absence of proposals by Arbitrum native protocols and the fact that most liquidity on Arbitrum is on non-native protocols, making it difficult to allocate a large amount of stablecoin while retaining a competitive yield.\n\nGiven the dearth of sufficient proposals, our recommendation is to do nothing rather than something not justifiable from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n---\n# Edit 06.03.2025 V3\nFurther Clarification on the Shortlisted Rationale\n\n# TMC Clarification on ARB Strategy Decision\n\nHello everyone,\n\nFirst, we want to sincerely thank the teams at @avantgarde, @karpatkey, and Myso for taking the time to discuss their proposals in greater detail with us. We appreciate your proactive approach and the thoughtful contributions you have made, both privately and in the forum.\n\nBelow, we provide additional context on our recommendation to defer active deployment of the ARB allocation at this time, along with feedback on each proposal\u2019s approach and risk management.\n\n# Overall Rationale for the \u201cHold ARB\u201d Recommendation\n\n### Risk and Transparency\n\nWhile both teams have made significant efforts, the operational details for the ARB strategies, such as liquidity for options, counterparty arrangements, and daily/weekly execution, remain unclear. Given the large ARB allocation, this uncertainty makes us cautious.\n\n### Yield versus Complexity\n\nThe proposed yields for ARB strategies vary widely, ranging from near zero (for example, simple lending) to around 30% (for example, covered calls). However, the higher-yield strategies depend on liquidity or counterparties that may not be scalable, and the lower-yield approaches (for example, 0.16% on Aave) do not justify the additional complexity and risk.\n\n### Asset Manager Selection Considerations\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that selecting an asset manager for alpha generation typically requires a multi-year to decade-long track record across multiple market regimes, a challenging standard, even in traditional finance. Therefore, if the core ARB strategy cannot stand on its own merits, claims of expertise should not serve as the primary selection criteria.\n\n### Prudent Governance\n\nOur mandate is to protect the DAO's treasury. Rather than forcing a strategy with an uncertain risk and reward profile, we prefer to hold ARB until more robust proposals/strategies emerge. This is a postponement rather than a permanent refusal, and we remain open to future improvements.\n\n# Feedback on Karpatkey\u2019s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nWe appreciate Karpatkey\u2019s detailed Risk Management Plan, which includes non-custodial architecture (Safe + Zodiac Roles Modifier), protocol whitelisting (Aave, Compound, Dolomite, Fluid, etc.), and clear maximum exposure thresholds (e.g., no more than 20\u201325% per protocol).\n\nThe yield estimates of ~8\u201312% for stablecoins appear realistic, and Karpatkey\u2019s track record in managing other DAO treasuries (Gnosis, ENS, etc.) is well-documented.\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nKarpatkey proposes covered calls (via Myso) and deposit/borrow loops. While these ideas are valid in principle, the TMC remains concerned about the practical scalability of the options component (liquidity, strike selection, and counterparty discovery at large ARB notional sizes).\n\nThe lending-based approach offers minimal yield (~0.16% to ~4%), which does not justify the operational overhead or the added smart contract risk compared to simply holding ARB in a wallet. The covered-call approach is also sensitive to ARB price and carries risk in case of price appreciation as the cost of reimbursing the loan could exceed the value of the stablecoins used for farming. The backtest is based on a period of constant ARB price depreciation and therefore may not fully reflect this risk.\n\nAlthough Karpatkey mentions having advanced monitoring systems to respond promptly to adverse market conditions, we lack sufficient visibility into these tools to confidently recommend this approach to the DAO.\n\n# Feedback on Avantgarde\u2019s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nThe Risk Management section shared by Avantgarde (and MYSO) highlights position-sizing constraints, lockup safeguards, and a diversified stablecoin approach. We especially appreciate the plan\u2019s clarity on monitoring liquidity needs and the ability for the DAO to recall funds if necessary.\n\nExpected returns of 5\u201315% are in line with typical DeFi yields, and the approach includes established protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap.\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nSimilar to Karpatkey, Avantgarde\u2019s ARB strategy also leans heavily on covered calls (via Myso) for yield generation. Although the theoretical upside is attractive, we lack sufficient real-world liquidity data for large ARB notional amounts. In addition to the conversion risk, the strategy presents a risk in case of a sharp ARB price increase (which again may not be accurately accounted for in backtests done over a period of relatively constant price depreciation). For instance, vaults on Ribbon and Premia also rely on selling covered calls and have recently incurred losses despite both vaults having widely different strategies, following sharp increases in the price of the underlying assets:\n\n![|279x242](upload://s9o3LomjufpoKGFCv2vNkXsIZ7e.png)![|278x242](upload://muAKCFJgbv5cgXo77WVyzhgL7CL.png)\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-ETH-C\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-WBTC-C\n\n![|624x237](upload://sZsXqwOlNY5GCyQH9FPHflXdoVZ.png)\n\nhttps://app.premia.blue/vaults/0xdc631d88dbb5eb39f5c4bf8b4e5298d098912fff\n\nWe value the team\u2019s willingness to iterate on strike selection and maturity dates, but given current market conditions, we do not see a clear, low-risk path to consistent yields above simple \u201chold\u201d alternatives.\n\n---\n\n# Reminder of Grading Criteria\nOur evaluation of proposals was based on the following key factors:\n- **25% \u2013 Experience & Track Record:** Demonstrated ability to manage treasury assets securely and effectively.\n- **25% \u2013 Risk Management:** Strength and clarity of risk mitigation measures under diverse market conditions.\n- **15% \u2013 Alignment with DAO Goals:** Consistency with the DAO\u2019s growth objectives and ecosystem utility enhancement.\n- **15% \u2013 Expected Returns:** Realistic yield projections and sound risk-adjusted performance metrics.\n- **20% \u2013 Transparency & Reporting:** Commitment to regular, clear reporting and continuous performance monitoring.\n\n----\n\n# Timelines & Next Steps\n\nWe will move forward with a vote on Snapshot next Thursday, March 6, 2025.\n\n\n**Phase 1 \u2013 ARB Conversion & Stablecoin Management (15M ARB)**\n\n**IF Stable Strategy is Deployed*\n- Initiate a three\u2011month phase to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins.\n- Proceed with the deployment of low\u2011risk, yield\u2011bearing strategies for the converted stablecoins, with regular performance and risk reporting.\n\n**IF Stable Strategy is not Deployed:**\nRetain the current ARB holdings without conversion.\nNo further actions will be taken regarding stablecoin management until a new decision is reached.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2013 ARB On-Chain Strategy Deployment (10M ARB)**\n\n**IF ARB Strategy is Deployed:**\n- Deploy the 10M ARB into on-chain strategies.\n- Despite going against the TMC recommendation, we will commit to establishing a set of safe parameters for running the strategy.\n\n**IF ARB Strategy is not Deployed:**\n- Hold the ARB tokens without deploying them into on-chain strategies.\n- 3 months post Snapshot the RFP process will be held again.\n\n**Additional Next Steps for Both Allocations**\nThree months after the managers have been elected, publish a comprehensive report detailing the performance and management outcomes and re-evaluate the allocation strategy for potential adjustments.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "4ceb05a5-21e9-41c9-b143-0cd7b4ac92ea", "proposal_id": "fef116df-1070-4cbe-8770-72e48933e1b5", "snapshot_id": "0x95a85f5d3d82215793ba9771ff06610d2ba9e2eaf58cdba904d7a9cb5b8bdc94", "title": "Consolidate Idle USDC to the ATMC\u2019s Stablecoin Balance", "author_name": "0xb4c064f466931B8d0F637654c916E3F203c46f13", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x95a85f5d3d82215793ba9771ff06610d2ba9e2eaf58cdba904d7a9cb5b8bdc94", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-07-24 17:00:00", "voting_end": "2025-07-31 17:00:00", "options": {"scores": [173946614.40768936, 30284.231970744073, 16083660.174080856], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-07-31 17:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:58.881", "body": "### Non-Constitutional\n\n## Key Changes Made on July 23, 2025\n\nThe 2025 Events Budget will no longer be dissolved, and instead funds will be moved to a yield bearing account managed by the Arbitrum Foundation/treasury managers. The Events Budget process will remain as currently structured until the end of 2025. \n\n## Abstract\n\n* Entropy proposes transferring the DAO\u2019s 2025 Events Budget (~1.04M USDC) to the [ATMC](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xfab795313df4ef1023c5f7f9027857637cc3841d62dc0b54796fbfa5f8096919), which will top-up the budget allocated to onchain treasury managers focused on stablecoin strategies. The Events Budget will continue to operate as designed through the end of 2025, but instead be earning yield as it sits idle.\n* We also propose to send the ~1.5M USDC left over from the ARDC v2, which was recently denied an extension, to be sent to the ATMC to further top-up the budget allocation to onchain treasury managers. This modifies the recently passed proposal which defined the next step as the \u201cAF returning all unused funds to the treasury\u201d, which would forfeit yield until another onchain proposal process in its entirety is carried out.\n* Lastly, we propose sending any remaining funds from the ADPC Security Subsidies budget to the ATMC, which will again be used to top-up the onchain treasury managers budget.\n* The proposal will be moved to a vote on July 24th, and if passed, funds from the ARDC V2 and 2025 Events Budget will be transferred within 7 days from their current addresses to this [address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd8e35e2450003cd8d50cc804aee4db0a8872b7a9#tokentxns) where the ~4.95M USDC for the ATMC currently resides. Following the completion of the ADPC Security Subsidies, whatever USDC remains will also be sent to the same address designated for onchain stablecoin strategies managed by DAO approved treasury managers.\n\n## Motivation & Rationale\n\n### 2025 Events Budget\n\nWhile Entropy believes events are a vertical that should for the most part fall under the Foundation\u2019s scope and that smaller events should be funded by the D.A.O. grants program, the community has requested that this issue be taken up separately rather than being consolidated into a larger Snapshot vote. As such, we have modified this proposal to simply move the 2025 Events Budget into a yield bearing account with the ATMC to top up the stablecoin strategy allocation to treasury managers.\n\nThe Events Budget remains intact and will continue to follow the process outlined per the original [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734) through 2025. Once 2025 comes to an end, the Stablecoins will remain allocated to the ATMC rather than being returned to the DAO treasury to ensure they continue to earn yield. \n\n### ARDC V2\n\nThe ARDC v2 Extension [proposal](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x765b297702f21736e7b52c23d781dc76968519fef9c7b1ca1f924d167b2a6899) recently came to a close, which resulted in the collective NOT being extended. The instructions per the proposal were defined as \u201c(The) AF returning all unused funds to the treasury\u201d. However, now that the funds have already been converted from ARB into stablecoins, there is no sense in sending these funds back to the treasury to sit idle, and forcing another proposer to go through the entire onchain governance process to ensure they are earning yield for the DAO.\n\n### ADPC Security Subsidies\n\n670,543.5 USDC was transferred from the MSS to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled [address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x073a8f65ed92da9f9f64db0d69f424aa978e1ccd#tokentxns) as a part of the MSS wind down. Entropy Advisors is engaged in ongoing discussions with the Arbitrum Foundation in regards to what portion of these funds have already been committed to service providers versus what is remaining/owed to the DAO. We propose sending any remaining ADPC Security Subsidy funds to the ATMC as well once the AF pays out any outstanding contractual obligations. We do not want this process to stall this proposal, as doing so would potentially result in the ARDC v2 funds being returned to the DAO treasury. Instead, we seek the DAO\u2019s approval to reallocate these funds to the treasury managers deploying onchain stablecoin strategies once the situation has been sorted.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe 2025 Events Budget currently holds [1,044,095.59 USDC](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1a5184b21a8731e60a98511edee1c917744267c0). If approved, the entirety of that balance will be moved to the Foundation controlled [wallet](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd8e35e2450003cd8d50cc804aee4db0a8872b7a9#tokentxns) that is designated for onchain stablecoin strategies managed by DAO approved treasury managers. The Events Budget process will remain unchanged for authors who wish to pull from this allocation of stablecoins to host an event.\n\nThe ARDC V2 currently holds [1,503,604.08 USDC](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x22a017676274d67dec950391569b3a13d5199a4a) and 112,245.95 ARB. The ARDC has finished and posted its final deliverable, the Arbitrum Ecosystem Mapping Report. Final invoices will now be obtained from the two research service providers, Castle Capital and DeFiLlama, and USDC payments initiated with the Arbitrum Foundation. Once these payments have been sent, the remaining USDC balance will be moved by the Foundation to the wallet designated for onchain stablecoin strategies. The remaining ARB will be returned to the DAO\u2019s treasury.\n\nAs mentioned above, once the Arbitrum Foundation pays out any outstanding contractual obligations related to the ADPC Security Subsidies program, the remaining USDC will be sent to the ATMC. The ATMC will update the DAO once this has occurred on its dedicated forum thread.\n\nThe 15M ARB allocated to stablecoin strategies was recently converted into ~4.95M USDC, but this proposal would increase this allocation to ~7.5-8M USDC. These funds will either be split pro-rata amongst various treasury managers already approved by the DAO, or allocated according to the newly introduced ATMC procedures i.e., allocation recommendation from Entropy followed by OAT approval. These funds have been idle for several months, which could have otherwise been earning yield. This proposal is a part of a larger effort to strengthen the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s financial position to enable long-term sustainable growth/increasing revenue.\n\n## Timeline\n\nJuly 14th: Forum post\nJuly 24th - July 31st : Snapshot vote\nBy August 7th: If passed, funds will be transferred to the stablecoin strategy address within 7 days", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "4ceca8f9-99bb-426a-a9c2-5e8d0eef6998", "proposal_id": "ae6b72ed-9931-4f2e-9c94-164cf6885e68", "snapshot_id": "0xc591f79422bf26faf13055df098142569785c04316fdae5be993e282721eb717", "title": "Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc591f79422bf26faf13055df098142569785c04316fdae5be993e282721eb717", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-01-18 21:33:46", "voting_end": "2024-01-25 21:33:46", "options": {"scores": [111076415.5097518, 561076.31516187, 19799763.673925266, 168853.48141676493, 972395.061326395], "choices": ["Increase the threshold to 9/12", "Increase the L2 timelock delay", "Increase the threshold and delay", "Make no changes.", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-01-25 21:33:46", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.873", "body": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the \u201cStage 1\u201d designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to \u201cStage 0\u201d designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise. \n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See \u2018Specifications\u2019 for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by\u00a0[Vitalik\u2019s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of\u00a0**e**mergency actions\u00a0and\u00a0non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power \n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay \n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it\u2019s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1) The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n2. The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n\nIncreasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it\u2019s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn\u2019t require an on-chain upgrade.\n\nOn the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n2) The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the \u2018DelayedInbox\u2019. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n\n3) The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 6 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere\u2019s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n**RFC -** January 11th to January 18th\n\n**Snapshot -** January 18th to January 25th\n\n**On-Chain Vote:** January 30th to February 13th\n\n**Execution Delay:**\n\n- February 13th to February 16th - L2 Waiting Period\n- February 16th to February 23rd - L2-to-L1 Message\n- February 23rd to February 27th - L1 Waiting Period\n\n**Please note the aforementioned timeline is tentative and the actual timeline might be slightly different.**", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "4dae7853-c7c0-4c14-a286-6e8032060296", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x817ca6edf6d7e5c9fd5c9839cdd266c600054a443169fdb577bc7567f70073f0", "title": "LTIPP Retroactive Community Funding Selections", "author_name": "0xAbAbE91A907fAdff921720C43ABe4098e7245E99", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x817ca6edf6d7e5c9fd5c9839cdd266c600054a443169fdb577bc7567f70073f0", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-10-10 20:22:14", "voting_end": "2024-10-17 20:22:14", "options": {"scores": [397075.32293354854, 8025522.025446151, 9465493.396481752, 519947.3180348915, 573576.5212645935, 6439454.368402294, 78263077.9433151, 38208113.34873056], "choices": ["Powerhouse", "cp0x", "Lampros Labs DAO", "Origin Protocol", "Tokenguard", "Serious People", "Do not fund", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-10-17 20:22:14", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.955", "body": "100,000 ARB from the LTIPP was allocated for retroactive funding to community members who add valuable contributions during the Pilot Program.\n\nDAO members who felt they contributed meaningfully to the LTIPP program applied via this forum thread: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ltipp-retroactive-community-funding/26903\n\n## How Voting Works\n\nLTIPP Retroactive Community Funding will be decided using an Approval vote\n\nDelegates may select any number of voting options.

While there has been organic growth in TVL, the grant incentives serve to attract more initial liquidity, while also providing a way for the protocol to gain valuable exposure.

It also updates the system so contenders must provide a signed message before running in the elections - this ensures they are able to produce signed messages for the different chains that the Security Council needs the ability to act on.\n\nIssues with the current Security Council election process:\n\n- In the nominee Selection stage, because contender registration and endorsement occur in the same 7-day period, delegates are likely to overlook applications that are submitted at the end of the period. This results in candidates who submit their applications at the start of the period having an unfair advantage, as they are more likely to be endorsed and therefore progress to the next stage.\n\n- Candidates might sign up to the elections using an on-chain smart contract wallet which is not able to produce signatures valid for other ArbitrumDAO-governed chains.\n\n- The constitution does not clearly express the election procedure.\n\nSpecifications\nAccordingly, this AIP aims to implement the following changes:\n\n1. A 7-day \u2018Contender Submission\u2019 stage before the \u2018Nominee Selection\u2019 stage. Accordingly, the duration of the entire election process will increase from 42 days to 49 days.\n\n2. For candidates to apply for a Security Council position, they are required to provide a signed message from their wallet.\n\n3. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to correctly reflect how quorum for proposals (as well as the election process) is handled, which should also take into account \u2018abstain\u2019 votes.\n\n4.

Based on feedback from delegates and ecosystem participants, we\u2019ve applied key lessons learned to create V2\u2014a more robust and refined iteration of the program.\nV2 will function like a Governance Bootcamp and the Onboarding Working Group will act akin to a recruitment agency, sourcing and training a select group of new DAO contributors.\nThe Onboarding Working Group is comprised of the following individuals: @Manugotsuka from @SEEDGov, @ocandocrypto from @web3citizenxyz, @san from Reserve Protocol, and @RikaGoldberg from @404DAO. Our advisors are @krst and @Sinkas from L2Beat.\n\n\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nArbitrum DAO needs to onboard high-quality and diverse (**see note 1**) governance participants to thrive in the future. Currently, fragmented information, siloed resources, and private communication channels create a culture of exclusivity, making it challenging for newcomers to navigate the governance process and contribute meaningfully.\n\nIn V1, we pioneered a solution by running a Pilot Program where we hosted weekly onboarding calls and grouped participants into one of five Fellowship tracks based on their interests and skills. Ultimately, each Fellowship was expected to collaborate and work on a Proposal to publish on the forum.\n\nBased on the lessons learned in V1 (details are [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/onboarding-pilot-program-final-report-milestone-3/26046)), we have developed V2, a more robust and meritocratic Onboarding Program. V2 focuses on selecting high-quality participants, training them, and assessing their skills\u2014 ultimately matching top performers with Arbitrum Protocols that need a Governance Fellow. (**see note 2**)\n\n**Note 1**: *In an effort to increase diversity within Arbitrum, we are committed to ensuring that at least 25% of program participants are female/non-binary. This ratio is aligned with the representation in the Pilot Program (V1). We will also focus on inclusivity, creating opportunities for LGBTQ+ and applicants from underrepresented regions, including developing countries, throughout the application and interview process.*\n\n\n**Note 2**: *V2 does not guarantee program participants with long-term placement in the DAO.*\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n**Governance Analyst** \u2014 An individual who is selected into V2 based on their application and interview.\n\n**Governance Fellow** \u2014 A Governance Analyst who successfully graduates from the program and is subsequently matched with a Protocol to assist with Governance work.\n\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Onboarding Program consists of the following components:\n- An Application and Interview Process.\n- A Curated Curriculum and Workshops.\n- Exercises to assess comprehension of workshop materials.\n- A Rubric to evaluate and grade exercises.\n- Completion NFTs/Forum Badge for Governance Analysts and Fellows\n- An updated DAO Contributors List\n\nThese components are described in detail below.\n\n## Applications and Interview Process\n\nTo assess candidates for experience and cultural fit, V2 will include a one-month rolling application period followed by a month of interviews, after which twenty applicants will be selected to join the program.\n\nWe will be seeking applicants with specific characteristics, including a positive mindset, an ability to work well with others, an aptitude to engage in healthy debate, and an eagerness to learn. Furthermore, applicants should have a high-level of familiarity with Ethereum and L2s.\n\n## Workshops\n\nOver the course of 6 weeks, the selected cohort of 20 Governance Analysts will participate in weekly workshops that cover critical concepts (see Curriculum section) of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s governance process.\n\nThe workshops will be primarily facilitated by Manugotsuka (Manu), a Governance Contributor at @SeedGov, who is most notably involved in managing Arbitrum\u2019s Delegate Incentive Program. Members of the SEEDGov team will also support Manu as needed.\n\n## Curriculum\nThe following governance content will be covered in the workshops:\n**Note: You can find links to all content in the original [forum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrum-onboarding-v2-a-governance-bootcamp/27546) post.**\n\n### Arbitrum Protocol Basics:\n- A gentle introduction to Arbitrum\n- Get started with Arbitrum\n\n### Arbitrum DAO Governance Basics\n\n- The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO\n- How to Delegate your Voting Power\n- How to Submit a DAO Proposal and Docs\n- Writing Your First Proposal to the ArbitrumDAO\n- Proposal Lifecycle (RFC, Snapshot, Tally)\n- Constitutional vs. Non Constitutional Proposals\n\n\n### An Introduction to the Arbitrum Foundation\n\n- The role of the Arbitrum Foundation\n\n### Arbitrum DAO: Important Proposals\n\n- Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO\u2019s Operations\n- COI & Self Voting Policies\n- Incentives Detox Proposal\n- Code of Conduct\n- Mission, Vision, Purpose\n\n### Arbitrum DAO: Important Initiatives\n\n- Delegate Incentive Program\n- Working Groups, Committees, Councils and Service Providers\n- Security Council\n- Key Delegates\n-Multisig Support Services (Entropy)\n- Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025\n- Stylus Sprint\n- Grants Programs: (Foundation, Questbook)\n- Additional Grants resources: GrantsDAO\n\n### Arbitrum Tech Deep Dive\n\n- How to create a Dapps on Arbitrum\n- Orbit Chains Technical Introduction\n- A gentle introduction: Stylus\n- Quickstart: Arbitrum bridge\n\n### Arbitrum DAO Tools and Resources\n\n- Karma Delegate Dashboard\n- Arbitrum Hub\n- Arbitrum DAO Twitter\n- Arbitrum DAO Updates\n- Governance Forum\n- Arbitrum DAO Calendar\n- Foundation-led: Bi-weekly Proposal Discussions Call\n- Monthly Governance Reporting Call\n- Telegram Updates Channel\n- Weekly Voting Reminders\n- Snapshot\n- Tally\n\n*Note: Recordings will be shared on X to maximize the educational content\u2019s distribution and reach.*\n\nA week-over-week schedule is presented in the below table:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreif3e3yjzza3btoh3yxsnei7atvve2yljb6fx443kbg7ienscfid34)\n    \n\n## Exercises\n\nAt the conclusion of the 6 weeks of workshops, participants will have two weeks to work on practical exercises to apply the knowledge they gained.\n\nThese exercises, along with the grading rubric, will be designed by Sandra Carillo (a V1 Pilot Program Fellow, Project Manager at Reserve Protocol, and Developer).\n\nThe top 10 submissions will be eligible to be matched with an Arbitrum Protocol where they will acquire real-world governance experience as Governance Fellows (more details in the \u2018Governance Fellows\u2019 section).\n\nThose not selected for matching will be invited to participate in the next cohort on a \u201cfast-track,\u201d bypassing the application and interview process. This creates a positive feedback loop, providing multiple opportunities for individuals to be matched with a Protocol and contribute to Arbitrum governance.\n\nThe next section provides Sample Exercises.\n\n### Mandatory:\n\n1. Draft a mock proposal for Arbitrum DAO and submit it for feedback on the Governance Forum \u2013 This encourages participants to actively engage with the governance process, understand proposal creation, and contribute thoughtful feedback. This is an exercise that can be made in groups of 3 or 4 people.\n\n2. Comment on at least three different Governance Forum proposals, providing thoughtful feedback or questions \u2013 This ensures participants are involved in governance discussions and contributing to decision-making.\n\n3. Write a blog post explaining how to participate in governance for Arbitrum DAO and share it on X or Farcaster\u2013 This promotes deeper understanding of the DAO structure and helps educate the broader community.\n\n4. Attend an Open Discussion of Proposal(s) call and write a thread about your experience on X or Farcaster \u2013 Participation in live discussions helps foster community engagement and ensures participants are informed about ongoing governance. As the Open Discussion of Proposal(s) happens every 2 weeks, the participants will have the opportunity to attend to at least 1 call.\n\n5. Share on the governance forum how you would vote on a proposal that\u2019s currently in active voting, explaining your rationale and feedback \u2013 This promotes critical thinking and encourages participants to articulate their rationale on voting process.\n\n### Bonus Points\n\n1. Write a tweet or a cast about the Arbitrum DAO Onboarding Program on X or Farcaster: Share your thoughts or highlights from the onboarding experience, spreading the word about how others can get involved.\n\n2. Share your insights after each workshop in an X or Farcaster thread: Reflect on key takeaways and learnings from the workshops, helping others benefit from your knowledge and fostering community discussion.\n\n3. Write a thread summarizing recent governance proposals and share it on X or Farcaster: Provide a clear, concise overview of the latest proposals to keep the community informed and encourage broader participation.\n\n4. Write a tweet thread explaining how ARB token holders can participate in governance and share it on X or Farcaster: Educate the broader community by breaking down how ARB holders can engage in governance, making the process more accessible and encouraging more involvement.\n\n\n*Note: These exercises will be refined before V2 starts.*\n\n## Rubric\n\nThe rubric that we will use to grade Exercise submissions is provided in the below table. We drew inspiration from the Rubric created by SeedGov for the Delegate Incentive Program.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeifjdau4h2r25gg74fqljlajldtt7slpgjtrnrq6vuzbghqnmwsv4u)\n \n\n*Maximum points per exercise: 25 points\nMaximum points for completing 5 mandatory exercises: 125 points\nMaximum points for completing 5 mandatory exercises and 2 bonus exercises: 175 points*\n\n## Governance Analysts and Fellows\nThe highest-scoring Governance Analysts (up to 10 individuals), based on rubric evaluations, will graduate to become Governance Fellows and will be matched with a protocol to assist with governance work.\n\nEach Fellow will be paid a monthly stipend of $1,500 USD in ARB. The Onboarding Working Groups will support Fellows during these two-months to ensure maximum alignment and success.\n\nOcandocrypto (Angela), a Contributor at Web3Citizen and an Arbitrum DAO Delegate, will manage the relationships between Protocols, Governance Fellows, and the Onboarding Program.\n\nIf your protocol is interested in working with a Governance Fellow, please indicate that in your comment on this forum post or reach out directly to Angela @ocandocrypto on Telegram.\n\n\n## KPIs\n\n\nWe will be measuring the Onboarding program\u2019s success with quantitative KPIs. To ensure alignment and leverage existing DAO programs, we will base these KPIs on the metrics tracked in the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP v1.5).\n\nSpecifically, we will be using the following metrics (please refer to the Karma delegate dashboard):\n\n- Snapshot Voting (SV)\n*KPI: Percent increase in SV from beginning to end of program*\n- Tally Voting (TV)\n*KPI: Percent increase in SV from beginning to end of program*\n- Commenting Rationale\n*KPI: Percent increase in SV from beginning to end of program*\n- Delegates Feedback (DF)\n*KPI: Percent increase in DF from beginning to end of program*\n\nWe will use a 6-month trailing average will be used to calculate the program\u2019s starting baseline for each metric, smoothing out monthly variability in the number of proposals. For the program\u2019s endpoint, we will use a 3-month trailing average, aligned with the 3-month duration of the Fellowship.\n\nTo ensure realistic expectations for Fellows, we will use a 5% increase as a baseline goal for each metric.\n\n## KYC\n\nGovernance Fellows will need to KYC with the Foundation in order to receive the stipend. We will work with the Foundation on this process.\n\n## MSS\n\nWe plan to use the MSS services for payment.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe have intentionally allocated ample time, 2 weeks, for delegates to respond and provide feedback on the forum. We will incorporate the feedback and make necessary revisions before posting to Snapshot.\n\n\nExpected Timeline:\nRFC Discussion: *November 18 - Dec 2*\nSnapshot: *Dec 5 - Dec 12*\nTally: *January 6 - January 27*\nWe are planning to start the Program on February 10, 2025 and end on September 29, 2025.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe are proposing a budget of $193,138 USD (including a 30% volatility buffer and accounting for an ARB price of $0.69) paid in ARB over 7 months. Any unused ARB will be returned to the DAO.\n\nA detailed budget breakdown can be found here: [Arbitrum Onboarding WG Budget V1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MNFl_Uko0tY5kiG1F4eoLbYeA7EU5W5RDb_RBKTJ9ec/edit?gid=1283170482#gid=1283170482).\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidqkbhiyes56ltf3v6ggmrdzd7pddqbxypdd66mwwix6b23gtqmeu)\n    \n## Appendix\n\n- [Introducing the Arbitrum Onboarding Working Group Experiment](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-onboarding-working-group-experiment/22849)\n- [Introducing Arbitrum Fellowships](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/introducing-arbitrum-fellowships/23235)\n- [Milestone 1 Status Update](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-onboarding-working-group-milestone-1-status-update/23621)\n- [Milestone 2 Status Update](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-onboarding-working-group-milestone-2-status-update/24867)\n- [Onboarding Pilot Final Report (Milestone 3) and Lessons Learned](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/onboarding-pilot-program-final-report-milestone-3/26046)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nBig thank you to the following individuals who helped shape this proposal over many months of brainstorming, feedback, and iteration:\n\nAlice Corsini from Karpatkey, Ana-Maria Yanakieva from Arbitrum Ventures Initiative, Bhaumik Patel from Atrium Academy, Cole Schendl from 404 DAO, Cliff and Raam from Arbitrum Foundation, David Paperno from The Mount Vernon School, Erin Koen from Uniswap Foundation, Eugene Leventhal from Scroll Foundation, Frisson from Tally, Joe McKenzie from R3gen Finance, Katerina Bohle-Carbonell from Together-Crew, Krzys and Sinkas from L2Beat, Liz Yang from Azuki, Nestor Bonilla, Sov from Gitcoin, and Tnorm from Gauntlet.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "50d32006-4d7f-4acb-9107-900f64108200", "proposal_id": "a19926f4-e7a3-4a7b-a0c1-9032e007e68d", "snapshot_id": "0x107fc8aecc6054725266830cd9097b7ff71f632c708c5ca39e58c5be88f46f14", "title": "[Non-consitutional] User Research: Why build on Arbitrum?", "author_name": "0xA5dF0cf3F95C6cd97d998b9D990a86864095d9b0", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x107fc8aecc6054725266830cd9097b7ff71f632c708c5ca39e58c5be88f46f14", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-11-29 02:53:27", "voting_end": "2024-12-06 02:53:27", "options": {"scores": [23493880.533866968, 19703210.2197705, 84768928.34685881, 2445880.778548268], "choices": ["Researching within Arbitrum only", "Arbitrum + 2 others (SOL + OP)", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-12-06 02:53:27", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.903", "body": "# **Summary**\n\nAs Arbitrum seeks to grow, it\u2019s critical to understand why builders and entrepreneurs choose to develop on this platform, and what its strengths and weaknesses are compared to its competitors.\n\nCurrently, Arbitrum delegates and key organisations in the ecosystem (GCP, OCL, Foundation, etc.) have multiple theories on why some developers and entrepreneurs opt for it as their technology of choice and others don\u2019t. And many choices are being made to define which programs to fund and how to prioritise the technical roadmap.\n\nWe aim to interview builders and entrepreneurs to understand:\n\n1. why they build on Arbitrum  \n2. what features they want to see in future development  \n3. who are the types of people that are more or less likely to be Arbitrum\u2019s users.\n\nBeyond what desk research or a survey can accomplish, this research will provide the Arbitrum DAO and affiliated entities with a deep understanding of builders' mental models and decision frameworks, allowing better strategic choices. To ensure relevance, we\u2019ll create a Stakeholder Council (and success bonus approved by said council) and work closely throughout the project, refining research questions, sharpening the research focus from preliminary findings, and ensuring comprehensiveness of the final report.\n\nWe\u2019ll also coordinate with the ARDC research position to complement their work with our deep user research capabilities.\n\n# **Context**\n\nWhile Arbitrum has a strong brand and core competencies that separate it from competitors, it\u2019s still unclear which features are most important to developers and what kind of support would be most meaningful. We don\u2019t really know *why* builders choose Arbitrum over its competitors. Is it the capability to use a variety of programming languages? Is it the technology\u2019s existing ecosystem? Is it something else?\n\nMultiple technical comparisons have been done (e.g., [L2Beat report](https://l2beat.com/multisig-report), [Binance report](https://www.aicoin.com/en/article/361365), [MIIX Capital report](https://medium.com/@miixcapitalen/layer2-blockchain-research-report-163285df4788), [Tiger research](https://reports.tiger-research.com/p/l2-wars-the-hyper-competitive-life-eng)). However, there\u2019s a lack of research that focuses on the perspective of users.\n\nThis represents a strategic threat \\- how do Arbitrum organisations (GCP, OCL, Foundation, DAO, etc.) build on our collective strengths if it\u2019s not even clear which strengths (or weaknesses) make the difference? And, how does Arbitrum effectively distinguish itself from other Layer 2 (and Layer 3\\) technologies if it isn\u2019t clear why builders might prefer those platforms?.\n\n# **Proposal**\n\nWe propose to do intensive research with builders and entrepreneurs to establish a deep understanding of the features important to these critical members of our ecosystem. This will identify why Arbitrum has become a technology of choice among its users, where its weaknesses are, and promising directions for future development.\n\nWe will also develop profiles of the \u201ctype\u201d of people most likely to build on Arbitrum, so we get a sense of who our existing market is (and is not) to give clarity on how to best expand the ecosystem.\n\nThis research will be done in close collaboration with Arbitrum\u2019s key organisations and stakeholders, to ensure maximum relevance and actionability. For this, we\u2019re proposing to set up a Stakeholder Council including:\n\n* Representative(s) from the Foundation  \n* Representative(s) from Offchain labs  \n* Representative(s) from Gaming Catalyst Program  \n* Arbitrum DAO Delegates\n\nOur research goals include:\n\n1. Understand why builders who build on Arbitrum selected it as their technology of choice. Illustrated the storyline of how people come to build on Arbitrum.  \n2. Identify key strengths and weaknesses that Arbitrum has in comparison to 2 key competitors from the perspective of builders.  \n3. Highlight key areas for future development for Arbitrum (both technical and support programs), from the standpoint of builders and entrepreneurs who use the platform.  \n4. Build a profile of prototypical Arbitrum users to better understand the types of people who tend to prefer this technology.\n\nThe research participants will include:\n\n* Builders from Arbitrum\u2019s established and emerging verticals (DeFi, Gaming, AI, etc.).  \n* Builders with a variety of tenures, split between builders who have used Arbitrum for more than a year and less than a year.  \n* Builders who have either come to Arbitrum to build entirely new projects versus those who use the technology to expand on their existing projects.  \n* Builders who have chosen competing ecosystems (e.g. Solana, Optimism, Base. TBD with Stakeholder Council).\n\nThis composition of participants is meant to offer both a broad understanding of Arbitrum\u2019s user base, while also making sure we are able to identify nuance at the level that is relevant for actual builders. We will be able to highlight trends that are relevant Arbitrum-wide, while also diving into the insights that help us understand the needs of builders in specific projects and with specific experiences.\n\nResearch questions:\n\nWe\u2019ll refine the research questions together with a council comprised of\n\n* Representative(s) from the Foundation  \n* Representative(s) from Offchain labs  \n* Arbitrum DAO Delegates\n\nMethods\n\n* We will do live interviews with all participants that focus on the following topics:  \n  * Participant background and projects  \n  * Specific project demands  \n  * Participant decision-making process around platform and technology use  \n  * A comparison of different development technologies  \n* We will organize the interviews around the Voice of Consumer frameworks such as Personas / Job to be Done.\n\nOutput/Deliverable\n\nThe output from this research will support Arbitrum\u2019s efforts to improve and expand, furthering its vision to become a great home for builders. Specifically, this research will:\n\n* Give guidance on future feature and support programs by highlighting builders\u2019 perspectives onArbitrum strengths and weaknesses  \n* Support the deepening of Arbitrum\u2019s ability to meet the needs of specific builders by highlighting which capabilities are most relevant for different projects.  \n* Support future outreach efforts to evangelize and bring people by highlighting Abritrum\u2019s key value propositions for specific types of builders  \n* Support the development of pipeline initiatives to bring people onto the platform by sharing how builders come to Arbitrum  \n1. The deliverable will be a research report that addresses our key research goals:  \n* Understanding why participants prefer Arbitrum (or other ecosystems)  \n* Understanding participants' mental models for decision-making around blockchains to build on  \n* Offering insights for further developing and expanding Arbitrum  \n* Understanding typical profiles of Arbitrum builders  \n2.

Their proposals leverage proven DeFi protocols and ecosystem synergies to maximize risk-adjusted returns while maintaining liquidity and principal protection.\n\n---\n\n# TMC Recommendation\nWe recommend a vote of **NO for the ARB Allocation**.\n\nOur analysis shows that the stablecoin strategies presented by the selected partners meet our criteria for DAO alignment, returns, risk management, etc. \n\nWhereas the current ARB proposals lack sufficient risk management and clear operational details\u2014resulting in low yield projections\u2014we believe it is prudent to sit out on this allocation for now.\n---\n\n\n# Voting Outcomes\n\n**ARB Strategy Allocation Vote:**\n- **Yes:** Proceed with deploying 10M ARB into on-chain strategies, managed in a 50/50 split between Karpatkey and Avantgarde & Myso.\n- **No:** Do not execute the on-chain strategy; hold the ARB tokens.\n\n---\n\n# Other Proposals\nDuring our review process, we evaluated several proposals that ultimately did not meet the criteria, required further clarity, or didn\u2019t align with DAO objectives. \n\n- **AnthiasLabs x XBTO:** Their proposal did not provide adequate detail on stablecoin conversion, DAO alignment, or custody arrangements, which are critical to our objectives.\n\n- **August Digital:** While proposing a single-sided AMM strategy for both ARB yield and ARB-to-USD conversion, the proposal provided minimal details. There was no evidence of existing ARB strategies or a dedicated vault, and the timeline for necessary audits\u2014if smart contracts are involved\u2014was not addressed. Moreover, the risk management section appeared generic, with much of the content seemingly repurposed from other contexts.\n\n- **Bracket Labs:** The submission lacked clarity on key operational components, such as the choice of OTC counterparties or DEXes. Additionally, the rationale behind the 2% trading volume figure and the associated price impact considerations were not explained. Although a Stablecoin Vault is reportedly live, the lack of public transparency and reliance on historical yield figures from related funds (rather than the target vault) were significant concerns, compounded by high fee structures.\n\n- **WINR:** The implementation details were insufficient, leading to concerns over the alignment of risk and reward.\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit V2 \n**Below is a summary of the strategies, including fees and expected returns. Please refer to the tables for full details and note the associated risks outlined below.**\n\nNote that strategies might share the same general risks, and differences in returns may come down to how effectively the providers optimize yield under varying market conditions.\n\nThere are no guarantees or risk-sharing by the providers. As described below, fees are based on the allocation of assets to each provider and/or their performance.\n\nNote that for the Arbitrum Strategy, while both applicants use Myso they have wildly different reported return profiles (hence different risk profiles).\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Strategy**\n\n|Arbitrum Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp. Returns | Fees|\n|--- | --- | --- | ---|\n|Karpatkey | Myso | 7-20% | 0.5% mgnt|\n|Avantgarde/MYSO | Myso | 30%+ | 15% perf|\n\n---\n\n## Key Risks\n\n### Arbitrum Strategy\n\n* **Smart Contract Risk:** Inherent risk of the protocol being compromised.\n* **Asset Risk:** ARB could lose all value.\n* **Counterparty Risk:** If no counterparty is found, the strategy\u2019s yield could drop to 0%.\n* **Liquidity Risk:** Liquidity is locked for the duration of the call (30 days for monthly, 7 days for weekly).\n* **Covered Call Risks:**\n  * **Potential Conversion Risk:** If the strike price is reached, the ARB allocation may convert into stablecoins (see \u201cManaging Potential Conversions\u201d).\n  * **Premium Fluctuations:** Option premiums vary based on ARB\u2019s volatility.\n  * **Secondary Market Risk:** If a covered call isn\u2019t held to expiry, exposure to secondary market prices may result as the matched trading firm buys back the call.\n\n\n---\n\n**ARB Strategies:**\nWhen it comes to the ARB proposals, our review was less encouraging. Although there are some promising elements\u2014for instance, Karpatkey and Avantgarde/MYSO show potential\u2014the ARB strategies did not meet our strict criteria for transparency and risk mitigation. Our internal grading highlighted significant concerns:\n\n* **Lack of Transparency:** Key operational details\u2014such as ARB option liquidity, allocation splits, and execution mechanisms\u2014were either insufficiently detailed or not publicly verifiable, particularly for strategies involving off-chain fund movements.\n* **Inadequate Risk Management:** Given recent security breaches and governance failures across the industry, we believe that preserving the DAO\u2019s capital is a priority. Without a clear risk framework, moving forward with these strategies would introduce unnecessary exposure.\n* **Trade-Offs vs. Returns:** The proposed strategies projected yields between 7% and 30%, depending on the strike price and maturity of options sold, and if the options are sold. If no counterparty is found the options strategy would yield a 0% return. Lending-based strategies offered minimal returns, around 0.16% per year which, even at our maximum allocation, would generate only $10,000\u2013$12,000 annually at current prices. Given the scale of the allocation ($7.5M), these returns do not justify the associated risks.\n\nGiven these trade-offs, we believe the risk is not justified for an allocation of $7.5M worth of assets. Until proposals can deliver fully detailed strategies that meet our risk-adjusted return standards, it\u2019s prudent to vote **NO** for the ARB allocation.\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Alignment Consideration:**\nA key criterion for evaluating submissions was alignment with Arbitrum. While most strategies will be executed on the Arbitrum network, not all will involve Arbitrum native protocols.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this but the main ones are the absence of proposals by Arbitrum native protocols and the fact that most liquidity on Arbitrum is on non-native protocols, making it difficult to allocate a large amount of stablecoin while retaining a competitive yield.\n\nGiven the dearth of sufficient proposals, our recommendation is to do nothing rather than something not justifiable from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n---\n# Edit 06.03.2025 V3\nFurther Clarification on the Shortlisted Rationale\n\n# TMC Clarification on ARB Strategy Decision\n\nHello everyone,\n\nFirst, we want to sincerely thank the teams at @avantgarde, @karpatkey, and Myso for taking the time to discuss their proposals in greater detail with us. We appreciate your proactive approach and the thoughtful contributions you have made, both privately and in the forum.\n\nBelow, we provide additional context on our recommendation to defer active deployment of the ARB allocation at this time, along with feedback on each proposal\u2019s approach and risk management.\n\n# Overall Rationale for the \u201cHold ARB\u201d Recommendation\n\n### Risk and Transparency\n\nWhile both teams have made significant efforts, the operational details for the ARB strategies, such as liquidity for options, counterparty arrangements, and daily/weekly execution, remain unclear. Given the large ARB allocation, this uncertainty makes us cautious.\n\n### Yield versus Complexity\n\nThe proposed yields for ARB strategies vary widely, ranging from near zero (for example, simple lending) to around 30% (for example, covered calls). However, the higher-yield strategies depend on liquidity or counterparties that may not be scalable, and the lower-yield approaches (for example, 0.16% on Aave) do not justify the additional complexity and risk.\n\n### Asset Manager Selection Considerations\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that selecting an asset manager for alpha generation typically requires a multi-year to decade-long track record across multiple market regimes, a challenging standard, even in traditional finance. Therefore, if the core ARB strategy cannot stand on its own merits, claims of expertise should not serve as the primary selection criteria.\n\n### Prudent Governance\n\nOur mandate is to protect the DAO's treasury. Rather than forcing a strategy with an uncertain risk and reward profile, we prefer to hold ARB until more robust proposals/strategies emerge. This is a postponement rather than a permanent refusal, and we remain open to future improvements.\n\n# Feedback on Karpatkey\u2019s Proposal\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nKarpatkey proposes covered calls (via Myso) and deposit/borrow loops. While these ideas are valid in principle, the TMC remains concerned about the practical scalability of the options component (liquidity, strike selection, and counterparty discovery at large ARB notional sizes).\n\nThe lending-based approach offers minimal yield (~0.16% to ~4%), which does not justify the operational overhead or the added smart contract risk compared to simply holding ARB in a wallet. The covered-call approach is also sensitive to ARB price and carries risk in case of price appreciation as the cost of reimbursing the loan could exceed the value of the stablecoins used for farming. The backtest is based on a period of constant ARB price depreciation and therefore may not fully reflect this risk.\n\nAlthough Karpatkey mentions having advanced monitoring systems to respond promptly to adverse market conditions, we lack sufficient visibility into these tools to confidently recommend this approach to the DAO.\n\n# Feedback on Avantgarde\u2019s Proposal\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nSimilar to Karpatkey, Avantgarde\u2019s ARB strategy also leans heavily on covered calls (via Myso) for yield generation. Although the theoretical upside is attractive, we lack sufficient real-world liquidity data for large ARB notional amounts. In addition to the conversion risk, the strategy presents a risk in case of a sharp ARB price increase (which again may not be accurately accounted for in backtests done over a period of relatively constant price depreciation). For instance, vaults on Ribbon and Premia also rely on selling covered calls and have recently incurred losses despite both vaults having widely different strategies, following sharp increases in the price of the underlying assets:\n\n![|279x242](upload://s9o3LomjufpoKGFCv2vNkXsIZ7e.png)![|278x242](upload://muAKCFJgbv5cgXo77WVyzhgL7CL.png)\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-ETH-C\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-WBTC-C\n\n![|624x237](upload://sZsXqwOlNY5GCyQH9FPHflXdoVZ.png)\n\nhttps://app.premia.blue/vaults/0xdc631d88dbb5eb39f5c4bf8b4e5298d098912fff\n\nWe value the team\u2019s willingness to iterate on strike selection and maturity dates, but given current market conditions, we do not see a clear, low-risk path to consistent yields above simple \u201chold\u201d alternatives.\n\n---\n\n# Reminder of Grading Criteria\nOur evaluation of proposals was based on the following key factors:\n- **25% \u2013 Experience & Track Record:** Demonstrated ability to manage treasury assets securely and effectively.\n- **25% \u2013 Risk Management:** Strength and clarity of risk mitigation measures under diverse market conditions.\n- **15% \u2013 Alignment with DAO Goals:** Consistency with the DAO\u2019s growth objectives and ecosystem utility enhancement.\n- **15% \u2013 Expected Returns:** Realistic yield projections and sound risk-adjusted performance metrics.\n- **20% \u2013 Transparency & Reporting:** Commitment to regular, clear reporting and continuous performance monitoring.\n\n----\n\n# Timelines & Next Steps\n\nWe will move forward with a vote on Snapshot next Thursday, March 27, 2025.\n\n\n**ARB On-Chain Strategy Deployment (10M ARB)**\n\n**IF YES, the ARB strategy is deployed:**\n- Deploy the 10M ARB into on-chain strategies.\n- Despite going against the TMC recommendation, we will commit to establishing a set of safe parameters for running the strategy.\n\n**IF NO, the ARB strategy is not deployed:**\n- Hold the ARB tokens without deploying them into on-chain strategies.\n- 3 months post Snapshot the RFP process will be held again.\n\n**Additional Next Steps for Both Allocations**\nThree months after the managers have been elected, publish a comprehensive report detailing the performance and management outcomes and re-evaluate the allocation strategy for potential adjustments.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "5139e592-31c7-49a5-b069-c0d8847ceebe", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xecdfb60e3c20afe76901c3f23105674c121243880d00bd3fe4a125b9e3485324", "title": "LOGX LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0x18BF1a97744539a348304E9d266aAc7d446a1582", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xecdfb60e3c20afe76901c3f23105674c121243880d00bd3fe4a125b9e3485324", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [127741798.44519964, 7353189.088649395, 2520286.95894617], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.484", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/logx-ltipp-application-draft/21956\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\n\nLogX\u2019s application was solid and scored well across most criteria.

This brings the potential total term to one (1) year.\n* Funding Structure Revision: A restructuring of the funding approach to better align with the updated objectives and framework.\n* Supervisory Council Composition: The Supervisory Council will have responsibilities at both macro and micro levels, ensuring comprehensive oversight, strategic alignment, and effective day-to-day operations. At the micro level, two (2) of the elected members will focus on communications and one (1) will focus on operations.\n* Supervisory Council Elections: Candidates will specify their preferred roles in the application form, but a single general election snapshot will still be conducted as initially proposed. If multiple top-ranking candidates choose the same role, the highest-ranking ones are selected for that role, while others are redirected to fill alternative roles based on their preferences.\n\n## 1. The Supervisory Council: Governance and Strategic Oversight\nOne of the key structural changes in ARDC V2 is the establishment of a Supervisory Council. The Council replaces the previous DAOAdvocate role in ARDC V1 and the proposed role of the Operations Lead, aiming to distribute governance responsibilities more equitably and improve both macro and micro-level oversight. This move is designed to enhance the strategic alignment of the ARDC with the ArbitrumDAO's long-term objectives, ensuring that resources are efficiently managed and that the working members remain accountable.\n\nThe Supervisory Council will be composed of three elected members, each with distinct roles:\n* Two members will focus on communications, ensuring clear and consistent information sharing between the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO, and external stakeholders such as OffChain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* One member will focus on operations, managing day-to-day activities, overseeing financial transactions, and maintaining operational transparency.\n\nEach member will serve a six-month term, with the potential for a six-month extension, depending on the outcome of a Snapshot vote. The introduction of the Council helps bridge the gap between the high-level strategic goals of the DAO and the granular operational needs of the ARDC, allowing for more nuanced management and decision-making. The Supervisory Council will also handle conflict resolution, oversee communication strategies, and mediate between the ARDC and DAO in case of disputes, ensuring that activities remain aligned with the DAO's best interests.\n\n## 2. The Retainer Model: Aligning Incentives with Deliverables\nAnother important improvement in ARDC V2 is the Retainer Model, which aims to reduce the risk of underutilization and misaligned incentives by directly tying payments to project needs. In this model, working members are compensated based on the hours they spend delivering on their tasks, rather than receiving a lump-sum payment upfront. The model follows a structured payment plan:\n* One-third of the total cap allocated to each working member\u2019s role will be paid upfront, covering the first 1/3 set of hours.\n* The remaining two-thirds of the cap is tied to project-based deliverables and will be paid in phases: 50% upon commencement of each task, and the final 50% upon successful completion of the task.\n\nBy requiring applicants to submit hourly rates in their applications, the ARDC incentivizes competitive pricing and ensures that funds are allocated efficiently. The Supervisory Council oversees this process, approving deliverables and tracking the use of working hours to ensure that tasks are being completed as required. This model also mitigates the risk of \"pre-paid\" work not delivering the corresponding value, a challenge encountered during ARDC V1.\n\n## 3. Funding Structure and Extension Mechanics\nARDC V2\u2019s funding structure has been designed with flexibility in mind, allowing the DAO to control costs while still maintaining robust operational capacity. The proposal outlines three funding options\u2014Options A, B, and C\u2014each corresponding to different caps for the Security, Research, and Risk verticals. These options offer varying degrees of financial commitment, allowing the DAO to choose the level of funding that best matches its needs and risk tolerance:\n* Option A allocates $1.73 million USDC for operations.\n* Option B allocates $2.09 million USDC, serving as a middle-ground option.\n* Option C allocates $2.60 million USDC for larger-scale operations.\n\nEach option includes compensation for the Supervisory Council, set at 90,000 ARB across the 6-month term (approx. $46,800 USD at the time of the proposal). The Snapshot voting system will allow the community to decide whether to fund the ARDC under one of these options, abstain, or reject the proposal outright.\n\nFurthermore, the extension mechanics give the DAO flexibility in deciding whether to continue with the ARDC after its initial term. At the end of the 6-month term, the DAO will have the following choices through a Snapshot vote:\n* Extend the ARDC with the same working members.\n* Extend the ARDC with a re-election of working members.\n* Choose not to extend the ARDC.\n\nIf the DAO opts not to extend the ARDC, any unutilized USDC and ARB will be returned to the Treasury, ensuring that funds are not wasted.\n\n## 4. Aera\u2019s Protocol-Owned Execution: Streamlining Fund Management\nTo mitigate volatility and optimize the conversion of ARB into USDC for operational purposes, ARDC V2 will utilize Aera\u2019s Protocol-Owned Execution strategy. This innovative fund management solution employs off-chain logic to monitor on-chain liquidity, model price impact, and execute trades in a way that minimizes slippage and market disruption.\n\nUsing  @aerafinance Vault \u2014guarded by @gauntlet_xyz\u2014ARB tokens will be converted to USDC through @odosprotocol and @bebop_dex, decentralized execution platforms designed for efficient liquidity sourcing.\n\nThe strategy leverages both active and passive execution techniques:\n* Passive execution involves setting concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC liquidity pool, effectively creating limit orders to optimize the conversion process.\n* Active execution takes place during optimal market conditions, as determined by Aera\u2019s price impact modeling, which tracks intraday and medium-term price effects of trades.\n\nThis dual approach ensures that the ARB-into-USDC conversion process is as cost-effective as possible, reducing the risk of adverse market impacts and preserving the value of the DAO\u2019s assets.\n\n## 5. Risk, Security, and Research Seats: Building on ARDC V1\nIn ARDC V2, three specialized roles\u2014Risk, Security, and Research\u2014will build upon the foundations established during ARDC V1. These roles are designed to bring targeted expertise to critical areas of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring focused attention on risk management, security, and research, which were key in delivering the 43 important outputs during ARDC V1 produced by @blockworksres, @chaos_labs & @OpenZeppelin\n\n1. Risk Seat: Ensuring Protocol Safety\nThe Risk Member focuses on evaluating and mitigating risks within DeFi protocols. This builds on work from ARDC V1, where Chaos Labs conducted risk analyses on protocols like @vertex_protocol and @pendle_fi , providing insights on economic efficiency and systemic health. In V2, the Risk Member will continue this work, offering quantitative risk assessments and strategic guidance on managing potential threats in the ecosystem.\n\n2. Security Seat: Fortifying Governance and Contracts\nThe Security Member ensures smart contracts and governance mechanisms are secure, expanding on the significant security evaluations performed by OpenZeppelin in ARDC V1. Their work will focus on bug detection, fuzz testing, and ensuring governance upgrades are secure\u2014similar to ARDC V1\u2019s BOLD Security Analysis and Arbitrum Governor V2 Review.\n\n3. Research Seat: Data-Driven Insights\nThe Research Member will provide objective, data-driven analysis on key topics like sequencers and fraud proofs, echoing the work done by @delphi_digital and @blockworksres in ARDC V1. Research outputs will support governance decisions and help guide the DAO's strategic direction, just as V1 delivered insights like the Arbitrum DAO Treasury Research and analysis of STIP programs.\n\n### Interplay Between These Seats\nTogether, the Risk, Security, and Research members form the backbone of ARDC V2\u2019s specialized expertise. By focusing on their respective verticals, these members ensure that the ArbitrumDAO is equipped to handle the complex challenges of the DeFi ecosystem, from managing risks and securing smart contracts to fostering a data-driven approach to governance and innovation.\n\nThe Supervisory Council will oversee the performance of each of these members, ensuring that their work aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO. Furthermore, this structure allows for flexibility in allocating resources to the most pressing tasks, whether those relate to immediate security concerns, risk management, or long-term research initiatives.", "match_confidence": 0.7961, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "55532cfb-59ba-465f-9019-e99971a860ea", "proposal_id": "dbd9e717-37fb-435c-a26e-3ef5060838de", "snapshot_id": "0x8112be08246466f870d0b91590fe99211f73d15cfdadac62ff3f1e6b2f74869a", "title": "Long-Term Incentives Pilot Program", "author_name": "0x33DB27C21E0f7a2f3351A4C6DDceDFB9F713410b", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8112be08246466f870d0b91590fe99211f73d15cfdadac62ff3f1e6b2f74869a", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-01-09 18:50:13", "voting_end": "2024-01-16 18:50:13", "options": {"scores": [102883951.6796747, 1447166.7392413008, 70207708.52451321, 4416482.138632245], "choices": ["Fund Program with 45,815,000", "Fund Program with 35,815,000", "Fund Program with 25,815,000", "Don\u2019t Fund Pilot Program"]}, "last_activity": "2024-01-16 18:50:13", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.888", "body": "**The full proposal exceeds Snapshot\u2019s 20K character limit. A brief summary has been provided below. The full proposal can be seen [HERE](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223/19?u=matt_stablelab).**\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal establishes a Long Term Incentives Pilot Program for the DAO to test new incentive designs and answer the necessary questions to ensure we are ready to commit to the long-term program. This Pilot Program will distribute 25-45M ARB to protocols building on Arbitrum. The exact amount will be determined by the DAO via Snapshot vote and will be ratified via Tally vote. The program will distribute ARB to protocols for 12 weeks.\n\nThe specifications of the Pilot Program were designed to remedy the 3 largest complaints regarding STIP Round 1. The Pilot Program hopes to be a test run for these additions for the DAO to determine if they should also be included in the long-term framework.\n\n#### Problem #1: Too large a burden placed on delegates\n\nIn the original STIP, delegates voted on each incentive proposal individually, with almost 100 snapshot votes. This was extremely tiring for delegates and left many feeling they could not make informed decisions on every proposal.\n\n#### Solution #1\n\nTo remedy this problem, the Pilot Program will have a 5 person council elected by the DAO responsible for evaluating applications and selecting which protocols will advance to a snapshot vote to receive ARB. This will ensure all applications are thoughtfully evaluated with only the most deserving receiving incentives. Not only will this help to reduce the burden on delegates, but it will also help expedite the process and allow protocols to receive incentives quickly and efficiently.\n\n#### Problem #2: Protocols did not receive adequate feedback on their proposals\n\nA major gripe from protocols was they struggled to get feedback from delegates before the deadline. This left many feeling as though the better-connected protocols had an advantage as they were able to modify their proposals based on feedback to make them more competitive during the vote. Many protocols were willing to make changes to their applications to make them more appealing to the DAO but never received the proper feedback necessary to do so.\n\n#### Solution #2\n\nThe Pilot Program introduces Application Advisors. This will be impartial organizations tasked with providing each applicant with detailed feedback and guidance on how to improve their applications. This ensures each applicant can iterate on their proposal so they can put forward the best possible incentive plan for the council.\n\n#### Problem #3: Strict Limitations on Incentives Mechanisms\n\nSTIP Round 1 had strict limitations on how the ARB could be used as incentives. This was done to protect the DAO and prevent misuse of funds. However, the strict rules resulted in the stifling of many innovative incentive designs. Many protocols had interesting designs that used the ARB in ways that increased alignment, improved cost efficiency, or helped to limit the dumping of ARB. However, these designs were not permitted in Round 1 leading to almost all protocols resulting in generic liquidity incentive models.\n\n#### Solution #3\n\nThe Pilot Program provides more flexibility to protocols to create innovative incentive structures. With the addition of the Council and Application Advisors, the Pilot Program does not require the rules to be as stringent. Malicious or inefficient designs will be first filtered out by the Application Advisors and then rejected by the council. Allowing protocols to innovate on incentive distribution mechanisms will allow Arbitrum protocols and community members to get a better idea of which designs work and which don\u2019t work. This will help everyone as we prepare for a longer-term incentives program.\n\n## Flow of V2\n\n#### Application Period (2 week)\n\nProtocols will have 2 weeks to apply using the Pilot Program application template. The application template will be created by the Council and the Application Advisors to ensure everyone has the same goals and make it easier for the council to process applications. Applications will be posted in the Pilot Program section of the Arbitrum forum. Protocols only need to post the initial draft of their application during this period. They will then have 2 additional weeks during the feedback period to edit their applications. No late submissions will be accepted.\n\n#### Feedback Period (2 weeks)\n\nDuring the feedback period, the Applications Advisors will provide feedback and guidance on all proposals. Protocols will be assigned an Application Advisor who will provide feedback and guidance on applications on a rolling basis. Protocols will then use this time to work with the Advisors to edit their proposals before applications lock at the end of the 2 weeks.\n\nStableLab will also read all submissions during this period and highlight any rule violations to allow applicants to edit their submissions to ensure they comply with all program rules.\n\n#### Screening Period (1 week)\n\nDuring this period, the council will use the pre-determined rubric to grade each protocol and decide which protocols will advance to the voting period to receive ARB. The Council will use the rubric to select which applications will progress to a snapshot vote. The protocols that the council selects to advance to a snapshot vote must have a total funding amount that is equal to or lower than the incentives budget. This will ensure the DAO does not overspend should all Snapshot votes pass. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThe rubric will be created by the Council and Application Advisors during the Tally voting period and will be publicly available by the time protocols begin to apply. The council will be required to publish a brief reasoning for all of their decisions on the forum to create transparency and accountability.\n\nThe council must judge applications as they are and cannot accept protocols at lower amounts than their application states. For example, if an application asks for 200,000 ARB the council can not fund them with 100,000 ARB\n\n**EXAMPLE**: This is a hypothetical example using a budget of 10 ARB with 50 applicants that each request 1 ARB\n\n50 protocols apply requesting 1 Arb Each -> Councils grades all 50 applications using the rubric and narrow the selection down to the top 10 applicants to not exceed the budget -> 10 snapshot votes are created to allow the DAO to confirm the council's decisions -> 9/10 Snapshot votes receive a majority of \u201cfund\u201d votes -> 9 protocols are funded with 1 ARB each and 1 Arb is returned to the DAO\n\n#### Voting Period (1 Week)\n\nUpon completion of the preliminary applicant screening process by the council, the selected applications will be formally presented for consideration. Each application will then be subject to a voting process via Snapshot, allowing Arbitrum delegates to vote on the allocation of funds. In the event that the Snapshot vote is favorably concluded, the respective protocol will commence receiving its funding through an Hedgey stream, facilitated by oSnap execution pending the protocol successfully passing KYC.\n\n#### Incentives Period (12 weeks)\n\nSelected protocols will receive their requested ARB using bi-weekly Hedgey streams for 12 weeks. During this time, protocols will be required to provide bi-weekly updates on the progress of their incentives using this [template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-bi-weekly-update-template/19436). Protocols will be required to finish their incentive distributions or return any unused funds two weeks after their final disbursement is available.\n\nDuring this period Application Advisors will continue to work with the protocols to help them analyze and improve their distribution mechanisms. Protocols will be allowed to adjust their incentive plans as long as they do not violate any rules and provide their updated plans in their next bi-weekly update.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n#### Total Cost: 25,815,000 - 45,815,000 ARB\n\n* **Incentives**: 25,000,000 - 45,000,000 ARB. The exact amount will be determined by the DAO through a Snapshot vote. The entire budget does not need to be spent by the council. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO\n\n* **Council Members**: 125,000 ARB - 25,000 ARB each\n\n* **Application Advisors**: 105,000 ARB - 35,000 ARB each\n\n* **Research Bounties**: 200,000 ARB Total - the exact amount and sizes of specific bounties will be selected by the Council and can be vetoed by delegates.\n\n* **Data and Analytics Provider**: 150,000 ARB for data monitoring and reporting\n\n* **Program Manager**: 100,000 ARB for program design, organization, management, research report, and continuing development of the Long Term Incentives Framework. See the full list of responsibilities above.\n\n* **Proposal Creation Assistance:** 15,000 ARB - 10,000 ARB for Alex Lumley and 5,000 ARB for Bobby Bola for their time spent assisting with proposal design, hosting proposal office hour calls, and communicating with delegates to gather feedback.\n\n* **Retroactive Community Funding**: 100,000 ARB\n\n* **Multisig Signers**: 20,000 ARB - 2,500 ARB each", "match_confidence": 0.9706, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "5642fe01-3575-4ab2-8fbd-9c9065523e56", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x1e5052579c5ed931f90e03e59f34274ba0a006093a6eeeab65e5e4df552668cc", "title": "Pilot Program Advisor Elections", "author_name": "0x33DB27C21E0f7a2f3351A4C6DDceDFB9F713410b", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1e5052579c5ed931f90e03e59f34274ba0a006093a6eeeab65e5e4df552668cc", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-01-16 23:45:45", "voting_end": "2024-01-23 23:45:45", "options": {"scores": [37038414.93223259, 114111558.46533538, 6416482.52519249, 154756635.27476037, 8979790.893211663, 1261656.3580975998, 139631038.06483942, 110002933.90907703, 24422798.217448466, 23917060.004006505], "choices": ["Boardroom", "Castle Capital", "Gabriele", "JoJo", "Milan | Jonas", "padzank", "SEEDLatam Gov", "Serious People", "Travis Skweres", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-01-23 23:45:45", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.879", "body": "## Intro\n\nThis Snapshot serves to elect 3 Application Advisors for the Arbitrum Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program.

In return, the new Orbit chain is expected to share 10% of their chain\u2019s profit back to the wider Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes 8% for the ArbitrumDAO and 2% for a new Arbitrum Developer Guild.\n\n# Support chains other than Ethereum?\n\nOne restriction of the Arbitrum Expansion Program is that a new Orbit chain must be deployed on any chain that derives security from Ethereum.\n\nMore specifically:\nThe \u201c**Arbitrum Expansion Program**\u201d is a suite of tools and services maintained and provided by the Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Foundation Company (the \u201cFoundation\u201d) designed to enable you to deploy and operate a trust-minimized network that has its security depend on the security of the Ethereum blockchain, which by way of example, is intended to include optimistic rollups, zk-rollups, optimiums and validiums that settle to Ethereum (each, an \u201cArbitrum Nitro Instantiation\u201d).\n\nOver the past few weeks, the Arbitrum Foundation has received inbound interest from projects that want to deploy their own Orbit chain on other networks including, but not limited to: Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Cosmos, and others. We expect this type of interest to increase over time as the Arbitrum Tech Stack gains popularity on Ethereum.\n\nThis leads to the following question:\n\n* Should **the Arbitrum Expansion Program be changed to allow Orbit chains to be deployed on blockchain networks other than Ethereum?**\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting the ArbitrumDAO to decide on whether the Arbitrum Expansion Program should further expand and allow new Orbit chains to be deployed on chains other than Ethereum (and its derivatives).\n\nThere are a few points to consider when evaluating the above question:\n\n* **Revenue share**. Allowing widespread deployment of Orbit could potentially increase the revenue generated for the ArbitrumDAO simply due to the increased number of deployments.\n\n* **EVM dominance**. It can be argued that the EVM and Solidity has become dominant across the industry as it was easily adoptable by blockchain projects including rollups like Arbitrum. Accordingly, allowing widespread deployment of Orbit can further bolster EVM and Stylus (EVM+) dominance across the industry.\n\n* **Ethereum\u2019s competitive advantage**. Restricting Orbit chains to only Ethereum can potentially act as a competitive advantage for the Ethereum ecosystem, but there is a potential tragedy of the commons if the Arbitrum Tech Stack is only restricted to Ethereum while other rollups can be freely deployed elsewhere.\n\n* **Alleviate confusion on definitions**. There are increasingly blurry lines on what it means to settle on a particular chain as projects adopt different data availability layers, host chains, and bridge configurations. It may even be possible for a single rollup to have multiple validating bridges across different blockchains. Changing the license can alleviate the need to resolve these blurry lines and allow projects greater certainty when deciding to deploy an Orbit chain.\n\nOf course, the above is not an exhaustive list, and there are other points the community may want to consider when making their decision.\n\n# Implementation\n\nAssuming the ArbitrumDAO approves Orbit chains to be deployed on any chain, then the Arbiturm Foundation will be responsible for collecting the 10% chain profit revenue share on the new chain and eventually migrating the funds into the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s treasury and the Arbitrum Developer Guild.\n\nThe only requirement a project should consider before deploying on a chain is to check whether the Arbitrum Foundation has deployed a multisig to collect the revenue share. A multisig will be required to help the Arbitrum Foundation collect the fees and periodically bridge it to the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s treasury.\n\nAdditionally, the Arbitrum Expansion Program\u2019s description will be updated with the following:\n\n**Arbitrum Expansion Program** \nThe \u201cArbitrum Expansion Program\u201d is a suite of tools and services maintained and provided by The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company (the \u201cFoundation\u201d) designed to enable you to deploy and operate a trust-minimized scaling solution on a public blockchain network (each, an \u201cArbitrum Nitro Instantiation\u201d). Subject to the terms of, and your compliance with, this Arbitrum Expansion Program Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d), the Foundation hereby agrees to make the Arbitrum Expansion Program available to you to develop and launch an Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation. The Foundation will also help you pursue modifications and improvements to the Nitro Software (as defined below) in cooperation with the Arbitrum DAO and in accordance with the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, as amended, available at https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution (along with the Arbitrum Expansion Program, the \u201cAEP Services\u201d). The Foundation reserves the right to determine the AEP Services available to you, and it may change the nature of the AEP Services available to you under this Agreement from time to time in accordance with the values and decisions of the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n# Discussion and Voting schedule\n\nThere have been 2 governance calls to allow the community to discuss the merits on whether the expansion program should be extended:\n\n* 22/4/2024 \u2192 10:00 UTC\n* 26/4/2024 \u2192 16:00 UTC\n\nFollowing community discussion, the proposal is now being put for a temperature check on Snapshot with the following voting options:\n\n* FOR: \u2018Any blockchain network\u2019\n* AGAINST: \u2018Only Ethereum L1\u2019\n* ABSTAIN\n\n**There is no need for an on-chain governance vote (via Tally) as the license is managed by the Arbitrum Foundation.

Juanrah is receiving a monthly compensation of 8,750 ARB, which is 1,250 ARB less per month than the previous combined compensation of both council members.\n\nPer the ARDC V2 proposal, Supervisory Council elections will not be repeated to minimise voter fatigue, as their election was conducted through a single Snapshot vote.\n\n**Current Working Members**\nResearch \u2192 DeFi Llama Research and Castle Capital\nRisk \u2192 Nethermind\nSecurity \u2192 OpenZeppelin\n\nThe DAO may choose to retain the existing working members for faster continuation, or alternatively, trigger a re-election as per the framework established in the original ARDC V2 proposal. If a re-election is pursued, it will be coordinated by Entropy, the Supervisory Council member responsible for operations.\n\n## Extension Framework\n\n### Term Duration\n* **Tentative Start Date:** July 13, 2025, i.e. day after the current term ends (Note: subject to delay if elections for new working members are held)\n* **Tentative End Date:** January 12, 2026 (6 months following the start of the second phase)\n* **Total ARDC V2 Duration:** 12 months (aligned with the original ARDC V2 plan)\n\n### Funding Structure\nThis extension would release the remaining ~ 50% of funds approved in the original ARDC V2 approval. The only modifications to the original proposal relate to (i) MSS responsibilities being transferred to the Arbitrum Foundation, (ii) the Supervisory Council\u2019s compensation, whereby Entropy has waived compensation and Juanrah is receiving 8,750 ARB/month, representing a monthly cost saving compared to the previous structure.\n\nIf the DAO votes to extend the ARDC V2, this will result in the ARDC operating with a combined budget consisting of:\n\n1. Any remaining unspent funds from the initial 6-month term per vertical, **plus**\n2. Newly approved funds for the extension period, which have already been transferred to the MSS (now AF) and will become available for use following budget allocation by the Supervisory Council.\n\nThese additional funds for the second 6-month term are as follows:\nSecurity \u2192 330,000 USDC\nResearch \u2192 330,000 USDC\nRisk \u2192 205,000 USDC\nSupervisory Council \u2192 52,500 ARB (to cover payment to Juanrah for the 6-month term)\n\nAs stated in the original ARDC V2 proposal, this combined budget per vertical represents maximum caps, not guaranteed disbursements. They define the upper limits of what may be spent in each vertical, with actual disbursement contingent on necessity and approval.\n\nIf the DAO chooses not to extend the ARDC after the completion of this initial term, then the AF will return the remaining USDC + ARB to the Treasury. There will be no subsequent OTC to buy back ARB with the USDC.\n\n## Voting Options\nThis extension proposal outlines the following options for the ArbitrumDAO to consider, with the decision to be made through a weighted voting mechanism:\n\n**Option A:** Extend ARDC V2 with current working members \u2192 Approve the 6-month extension using the current Supervisory Council and working members, releasing the remaining 50% of funds.\n\n**Option B:** Extend ARDC V2 with a re-election for working members \u2192 Approve the 6-month extension using the current Supervisory Council, but hold new elections for Research, Risk and Security members, releasing the remaining 50% of funds.\n\n**Option C:** Do Not Extend ARDC V2 \u2192 Conclude the initiative at the end of the initial 6-month term, with AF returning all unused funds to the Treasury\n\n**Option D:** Abstain", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "5d8c2af5-7f3f-40e2-87ff-7a5278dbbccd", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xbf6e4f557b134cd75a344fc92946cea37e051176d62ce85aaf94179dabf68316", "title": "Furucombo STIP Addendum", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbf6e4f557b134cd75a344fc92946cea37e051176d62ce85aaf94179dabf68316", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-05-20 20:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "options": {"scores": [1384018.9045358996, 94882103.82981786, 40634677.48911808], "choices": ["Approve funding", "Reject funding", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.244", "body": "## Background\n\n**Link to initial STIP application:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/furucombo-final-stip-round-1/17102 \n\n**Link to Addendum:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-furucombo-stip-addendum/23599/5 \n\n**ARB Requested:**\n350,000 ARB\n\n## Reasoning\n\n**Who proposed this challenge:** \nCattin - Seed Latam\n\n**Why this request needs a closer look:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-furucombo-stip-addendum/23599/5", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "5e4eeae9-8e63-4f16-b296-89d7486ee215", "proposal_id": "701acb43-5882-4110-92a3-d68f39346452", "snapshot_id": "0x9ea3f5ef5b6c838ffc24430bb927baa13bf25dcf5f444358e89f0958bb41a5e7", "title": "Adjust the Voting Power of the Arbitrum Community Pool & Ratify the Agentic Governance Pivot", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x9ea3f5ef5b6c838ffc24430bb927baa13bf25dcf5f444358e89f0958bb41a5e7", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-05-29 21:00:00", "voting_end": "2025-06-05 21:00:00", "options": {"scores": [997916.3449825996, 139126814.56286222, 15841365.60683416, 43453528.556552425], "choices": ["A - Do nothing", "B - Reduce delegation to 100K", "C - Reduce delegation to 0", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-06-05 21:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.112", "body": "## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO[ voted](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79529399410531589353911088395953830829384332193617716676855043534419270111970?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) to delegate 7,000,000 ARB from its treasury to Event Horizon\u2019s Voter Enfranchisement Pool in September 2024 for one year. At the time of posting this proposal, Event Horizon\u2019s pool is the 19th biggest delegate by voting power, with almost all of the voting power being due to the ARB delegated from the treasury.\n\nThis proposal seeks to officially approve the pivot from the original proposal toward agentic governance and potentially significantly reduce the voting power delegated to Event Horizon\u2019s pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe main motivation behind Event Horizon\u2019s proposal, according to them, is that\n\n> \u2026there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all.\n\nThis is also the premise on which we (L2BEAT) decided to vote in favor of the original proposal \u2014 to experiment with enabling many community members to participate meaningfully in governance.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen the program fulfill this premise so far. Moreover, we understand that the program pivoted towards AI-agentic voting, which was not in the scope of the original proposal. Although we think the pivot is a good approach, we believe it deserves to be ratified by the DAO, and the voting power dedicated to Event Horizon should be adjusted until the community can get more context on and through the [AIG proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/agentic-governance-initiative-agi/29244/1).\n\nRegardless of how the original experiment went, we appreciate Event Horizon's willingness to find a way to make it work. We have been communicating with them over the past few months, and we appreciate their enthusiasm for helping increase governance participation. We see value in them continuing experimentation with agentic governance, but at a point where it does not significantly impact the DAO.\n\n## Rationale\n\nSimply put, a lot has changed since Event Horizon presented its original proposal. We think it\u2019s reason enough to justify revisiting the topic of the voting power delegated to Event Horizon\u2019s pool.\n\nThe DAO can discuss whether we should keep delegating the same amount of voting power to the voting block, amend the delegated amount, or wind down the whole initiative and return the ARB to the treasury.\n\n## Specifications\n\nAfter posting this proposal to the forum, we\u2019ll post a Snapshot vote with the following options on May 29th.\n\nA) Do nothing - acknowledge the pivot but keep the same amount of VP delegated to EH.\n\nB) Acknowledge the pivot and reduce delegation to 100,000 ARB.\n\n>*A voting power of 100,000 ARB would keep Event Horizon among meaningful-sized delegates but would not put them in a position to swing any vote decisively.*\n\nC) Wind down the whole thing and return the ARB to the treasury.\n\n---\n\n* If the proposal\u2019s outcome is \u2018A\u2019, EH\u2019s pivot will be ratified, but no change to VP will be introduced.\n* If the proposal\u2019s outcome is \u2018B\u2019, the MSS will return the 6,900,000 ARB (7,000,000 minus the 100,000 delegated to Event Horizon) from the respective Safe to the DAO\u2019s treasury.\n* If the proposal\u2019s outcome is \u2018C\u2019, the MSS will return the entire 7,000,000 ARB to the DAO\u2019s treasury.\n\nThe DAO will incur no overhead in terms of resources or additional costs for executing this proposal.\n\n## Timeline\n\nMay 22 - 29 \u2192 Forum Discussion\n\nMay 29 - June 5 \u2192 Snapshot Vote\n\nJune 6 \u2192 Appropriate action by the MSS if needed", "match_confidence": 0.9055, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "610174a3-26d5-44ad-82c6-42b3b4712aa3", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x0f2c7c5a82ff8a67969dcc966c8fb21711c37be938225a723bc3a7dfc873913f", "title": "Bunni LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0xAD16ebE6FfC7d96624A380F394cD64395B0C6144", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x0f2c7c5a82ff8a67969dcc966c8fb21711c37be938225a723bc3a7dfc873913f", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [131137365.78563853, 58250.85468089386, 628510.4631982553], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.639", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/bunni-ltipp-aplication-draft/21638\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nBunni\u2019s current metrics are a little low, but explanations were provided along with details of why they expect retention to be better. The grant ask is minimal and properly justified. Matching of bribes is a nice component and overall team has a proven track record. \n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe proposal from Bunni demonstrates a well-planned strategy, evidenced by their successful past incentive campaigns and ability to consistently achieve their targets. Their collaborative efforts, such as the partnership with Connext to improve bridge UX transaction time, reflect a commitment to product enhancement. Despite the small grant size, they intend to allocate a portion of the incentives to partner protocols, showcasing a collaborative approach to ecosystem growth. Bunni's protocol, which builds on UNI V3 to offer innovative tokenomics, has shown modest adoption on other chains. With Uni V4 on the horizon, having a protocol experienced in building on V3 and contributing liquidity to the ecosystem is valuable. The proposed KPIs and milestones are reasonable, further supporting the case for funding this proposal. Overall, the combination of strategic planning, collaborative ethos, and experience building on UNI V3 makes this proposal worthy of support. \n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR Bunni's proposal.\n\nDecent proposal.

The Sequencer posts batches frequently, and thus the batch-poster address must be controlled by a hot wallet. This means that if the batch poster\u2019s keys were compromised, Sequencing could be unstable until the DAO took action.\n\nThis AIP proposes a system in which a \u201cbatch poster manager\u201d role is granted to the operator of the Sequencer which has the ability to grant and revoke batch-posting affordances. This way, the batch poster manager could perform key rotations for the batch posters\u2014 routinely, and/or if a batch poster address is ever compromised \u2014 quickly and without the DAO needing to take coordinated action. Note that this proposal does not change the sequencer, but more so allow for easier key rotations on the batch poster.\n\nCrucially, this would not represent a change on the current system\u2019s trust model:\n\n* In both the current and the new proposed system, the Sequencer is entrusted with managing the batch posting affordance; in the current system, for example, the entity behind Sequencer could technically grant batch posting to an additional entity by simply sharing it\u2019s keys.\n* In the new system, the DAO would *still* have the same ability to revoke the Sequencer role; i.e., the DAO could update the batch poster manager (along with any batch posters).\n\n**MaxTimeVariation:**\n\nThe futureBlocks value in the the SequencerInbox enforces a max block height that a batch can be posted relative to the current block (likewise with futureSeconds). The current value for futureBlocks is 12, which was set prior to the Ethereum merge. A small value for future blocks means that a relatively small L1 reorg can cause an otherwise valid batch to revert. This proposal increases the value to 64, two epochs, in line with Ethereum\u2019s finality guarantees.\n\n# Implementation\n\n**Batch Poster Manager:**\n\nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/commit/c7554852a7c41ca5eaef298dab10472a7f550df7\n\nNote that this implementation is currently under audit and is dependent on the ArbOS 20 AIP changes ([AIP: ArbOS Version 20](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-20/20957)).

If you have concerns about the mechanism to define attendees or specific budget items (e.g. travel scholarships), please use a comment. Feel free to explain that any Tally approval vote would be conditional on XYZ. The vote I'm trying to focus it on the format selection.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates) and key stakeholders by organizing a dedicated off-site event. The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured event will be organized in Q4, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.\n\n\nThis proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to prioritise the most important agenda items to be discussed at the evente, ensuring the meeting time is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The event will then include professional facilitation to advance alignment, remove blockers, ensure proper note-taking, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.\n\n\nThe success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.\n\n\n## The Problem\n\n\nThe DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.\n\n\nAreas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We\u2019re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to test a format for deliberation between key stakeholders with a clearly defined agenda. If successful, the format can be replicated to continuously address agenda items.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n\nRecent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for focused events to catalyse progress. We want to build on these learnings to advance the ArbitrumDAO. The proposal includes:\n\n\n1. Agenda prioritisation (pre-event strategic aligment)\n\n\n* Project manager to engage with token holders, delegates, and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitating converging on the agenda. Including snapshot vote for agenda and format.\n* Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format.\n* Defining criteria for attendees in consultation with key stakeholders to ensure both a successful event and capture resistance for the DAO.\n\n\n2. Facilitation & Workshop Organization:\n\n\n* Either IRL event or Online workshops (to be decided by this vote)\n* Structured facilitation process to ensure effective discussion, note-taking, and converging to action items.\n\n\n3. Post workshop follow up\n\n\n* Sharing a summary of the discussion & agreed action points\n* Follow up with participants a month after the workshop to track progress on action items and liaison with Entropy, Foundation, and other parties to suggest next steps as appropriate.\n\n\nOptional (see voting options):\n\n\n* Travel and Accommodation:\n  * Accommodation and catering for attendees and organisers.\n  * Travel expenses for attendees not already funded by the DAO for travel expenses and not otherwise in the region (e.g. not attending DevCon nor DevCon side events).\n  * Travel expenses \u201cscholarship\u201d available for attendees upon request and subject to approval by the event coordinator.\n\n\n## Timeline:\n\n\n* September: proposal approval and then logistics planning and preparation.\n* Event to take place during Q4, exact date depending on the snapshot vote (see below)\n* Before end of Q4: Post-event reporting and follow-up.\n\n\n## What Does Success Look Like?\n\n\n* High-quality outcomes and actionable strategies from workshops.\n* Increased engagement and satisfaction among participants.\n* Positive feedback and a strong desire to continue similar initiatives.\n\n\n## KPIs:\n\n\n* 50%+ participation rate among engaged ([35%+ on-chain voting rate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates)) Top50 delegates, foundation, and off-chain labs.\n* NPS of 50 or more (-100 to 100 range, 0 considered average)\n* A similar initiative is organised again.\n\n\n## Options\n\n\n3 options are proposed. Please vote for the preferred one.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: the costs are not finalised but are here as an indicative so the best option can e selected. Once an option is selected we'll review the costs before moving to Tally. If you have any feedback on the costs, please share it with Daniel (@mrjackalop on Telegram) so it can be taken into account before the final onchain proposal.\n\n\n**Option 1: IRL version next to a major event:** \n\n\n* Next to DevCon Thailand, November 8th-10th.\n* 2-day event: day 1 arrival and facilitated dinner light discussion. Day 2 workshops. Day 3 breakfast and departure.\n* Including setup for hybrid participation (online participants supported with 360 cameras, moderator, and tech support)\n* Includes 20k travel scholarships for those not already in the region\n\n\naround $116k + 10k contingency\n\n\n**Option 2: IRL version separate from major event:**\n\n\n* In the most travel-friendly location for participants\n* During December 2024\n* 2-day event (same as above)\n* Including setup for hybrid participation (same as above)\n* Includes $50k travel for those not already in the region\n\n\naround $156k + 10k contingency\n\n\n**Option 3: Online Event:** \n* 3-4 online sessions (half-day sessions) over 1-2 months. With the possibility of input and feedback before/after event to ensure even those not attending can participate effectively.\n* During October-December 2024 (November likely skipped)\n\n\n around $35k + 5k contingency.\n\n\n\n\n[Detailed breakdown and comparison here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_pdVwma1ja8k0If2c_Fv8u36ZatVP_8SS24XGO5Cgs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n**Notes on budget**:\n\n\n* high-level calculations. The budget will be revised in more detail (by requesting a quote from providers, etc.) after a successful Snapshot vote.\n* Any funds unspent will be returned to the DAO.\n* Funds will be denominated in ARB for tally vote\n\n\n\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n\n### Facilitation\n\n\nThe opportunity cost of this meeting is easily 10x its budget, given the limited time availability of delegates and few occasions a year when they converge. As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the meeting is effective. The facilitation includes designing the workshops and moderating the conversation, AND thinking through how to create a strategic process for a DAO.\nCosts of Online facilitation might be lower than IRL. We'll confirm this before the onchain proposal, for now costs are indicative to select a direction.\n\n\n### Agenda\n\n\nWe\u2019ve already started the process of setting the agenda. We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.\n\n\nPre-selection of topics (to be refined and prioritised after the format is defined):\n* Defining strategic priorities for the DAO (vision and strategy)\n* DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)\n* Org Design\n* ARB token utility\n* Conflict Of Interest\n* Grant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)\n\n\nAdditional work to be done to define the agenda:\n\n\n* 2 workshops and async discussion to identify root causes (root topics) and prioritise.\n* The final agenda will be defined via a subsequent Snapshot vote facilitated by the project manager.\n\n\n### Hybrid Participation for IRL events\n\n\nWe\u2019ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost about $600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).\n\n\n### Attendees\n\n\n* Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants. I.e. not an onboarding event.\n* Open to [Top-50 delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates), off-chain labs, foundation members, and top 100 ARB token holders (both in Arbitrum One and Ethereum).\n* Additional attendees based on at least 20 million ARB endorsements (holders/delegates can endorse as many participants as desired).\n\n### Voting OPTIONS\n\nFormat: **ranked choice**\n\nOptions (due to Snapshots constraints the actual options available are shortened):\n1. RL event next to major conference (with travel scholarships for those not in the region) \n2. IRL event separate from major conference (with travel scholarships for those not in the region)\n3. IRL event next to major conference (NO travel scholarships)\nIRL event separate from major conference (NO travel scholarships)\n4. Online event(s)\n5. I believe we shouldI drop this and dedicate attention somewhere else\n6.

The goal is to ensure that well-supported proposals can successfully conclude by aligning quorum requirements with current levels of voter participation, reducing the risk of legitimate initiatives failing due to quorum thresholds not being met.\n\nFor non-constitutional proposals, the existing 3% quorum threshold will remain unchanged.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past year, the 5% quorum threshold for constitutional proposals within the ArbitrumDAO has been challenging, despite support from a broad range of delegates. As the circulating supply of $ARB continues to grow and voter turnout remains relatively flat, quorum requirements are becoming increasingly difficult to meet. \n[ARDC research on governance risks analysis](https://loving-bank-303.notion.site/Part-2-Governance-Risks-Analysis-1b605ac99aec80c282c7fa0105f13ce7) suggest that quorum on constitutional proposals could reach 300M (in base case) in about a year, while participation rate as % of votable supply has gone down from 8% in early 2024 to 4-5% in early 2025. Reducing the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5% provides a short-term adjustment that enables critical governance to move forward while longer-term reforms are considered and developed.\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nArbitrumDAO is governed by the principles of decentralization, participation, and credible neutrality. This proposal balances those principles by modestly reducing the constitutional quorum threshold to better reflect the current governance environment without undermining the legitimacy of approved proposals. This proposal also would not require any upgrades to existing smart contracts, helping maintain community trust and operational simplicity.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction was selected as a conservative adjustment that is expected to meaningfully improve the likelihood of well-supported proposals reaching quorum, while still maintaining a high enough threshold to deter governance attacks.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Constitutional Proposal: A type of proposal within the ArbitrumDAO that modifies governance structures outlined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. These require higher quorum thresholds than non-Constitutional proposals.\n\n* Quorum: The minimum number of tokens required to participate in voting for a proposal to be valid and eligible to pass. In this context, it is calculated as a percentage of the total $ARB votable tokens.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThis proposal updates the constitutional quorum threshold from 5% of the total votable tokens to 4.5%.\n\nAs of April 2025, with ~4.3B ARB in votable tokens (formula is total supply of ARB token, which is 10B, minus the amount delegated to the [exclude address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a4b86)), the quorum reduction would decrease the requirement by approximately 25 million ARB tokens, bringing the effective quorum from ~215M to ~190M ARB.\n\nNo upgrades to core governance smart contracts are required. Instead, this proposal will include an action contract that uses existing functionality to modify the quorum constant used in the calculation of constitutional quorum thresholds. The action contract will need to be audited, and this is expected to take 1 day.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction represents a minimal-risk, fast-to-implement interim solution, while other long-term solutions can be considered, such as flexible quorum, or franchiser contract.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe proposal will follow these steps:\n\n1. Forum discussion: This AIP is posted to the ArbitrumDAO forum for discussion and feedback from the community. [DONE]\n2. Temperature Check: An informal offchain vote is conducted on Snapshot to gauge community support. [ON-GOING]\n3. On-Chain Vote: A formal Constitutional AIP and call-to-vote is proposed to Tally for the on-chain vote. This proposal itself will be subject to the existing 5% quorum to pass.\n4. Update Governance Parameters: If passed, the new 4.5% quorum requirement would take effect immediately for all future constitutional proposals.\n\nNo smart contract changes or audits are required, which reduces implementation complexity and cost.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThis AIP does not request any grant or budget allocation.

However, the milestones set are too low. Currently, the proposal suggests spending on incentives to create a $5 million pool on Arbitrum, but most trading is expected to occur on BSC rather than Arbitrum.

The pilot aims to swap with 3-7, with a maximum swap budget of 2M ARB and a cap of 0.5M ARB per project.\n\nWe foresee token swaps as a complimentary mechanism to the current incentive programs for Arbitrum DAO to participate in the development and success of its ecosystem projects.\n\n## Motivation\nOne of the primary limitations of the initial incentive programs is that they were all one-directional, with Arbitrum treasury allocating ARB to projects and only receiving network transaction revenue in return. While project growth resulting in additional network activity does provide some upside for Arbitrum treasury, the effects will likely take years to accrue to a point where the net resources flow of the Treasury is positive, only once Arbitrum and the applications on top reach maturity.\n\nToken swaps provide a robust mechanism for value alignment and bidirectional upside between organizations. In addition to potential financial benefits, they come with governance and utility perks associated with tokens.\n\nMoreover, Treasure DAO\u2019s recent move from Arbitrum to ZKsync has shown that bidirectional, long-term alignment is even more critical, especially for protocols that play an essential role in the ArbitrumDAO ecosystem and have received significant ARB incentives.\n\nBy embedding Token Swaps as a vital element of Arbitrum Ecosystem Development and critical programs such as LTIP, Arbitrum can continue pro-actively incentivizing ecosystem growth while receiving additional upside and leverage in the most promising project\u2019s building in its ecosystem.\n\nThe detailed Token Swaps to DAO Token Swaps as Ecosystem Enablers report, 5produced by LuukDAO and JashFi through the Thank ARB Firestarters Program powered by Thrive Protocol, offers insights from over 50 DAO token swaps, which are the basis for this pilot proposal.\n\n## Rationale\n*The Token Swap Pilot contributes to Arbitrum DAO by:*\n\n* Increase bi-directional alignment with top ecosystem projects.\n* Gain valuable insights into strategies for ecosystem development, which can inform grant and incentive programs like STIP and LTIPP.\n* Create incentives for protocols to remain loyal to Arbitrum through a token swap program. In the pilot phase, reward those who held on to (at least 50%) of their initial ARB airdrop.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n*Projects eligible for a swap*\n\nDuring the initial Token Swap discussion, it became clear that stakeholders and delegates value the ecosystem alignment and contribution nearly as much as the financial upside. To optimize Arbitrum ecosystem alignment and longevity, the Token Swap Pilot prioritizes projects with significant past engagement with Arbitrum.\n\nOnly projects that received the initial ARB airdrop and still hold at least 50% of their tokens, participated in one of the STIP or LTIPP programs, and have a token available on Arbitrum Mainnet will be eligible for this pilot.\n\n19 projects that fall within this category have been identified. These projects still hold over 27,2M ARB in their treasury and have received significant rewards from the incentive programs. Projects outside of the group of 19 can demonstrate their eligibility.\n\nAny project that does not fall within the above categories will not be eligible for the Arbitrum Token Swaps Pilot. Still, if the pilot is successful, it may be an addition to future grant programs and expanded to prior STIP or LTIPP grantees.\n\n**To determine the exact swap size, the following parameters will be considered by the Committee members:**\n\nAirdrop Size:\nAirdrop % Sold:\nIncentive Rewards received:\nMarket Cap:\nFDV:\nLifetime Fees Generated:\n6 month Fees Generated:\nLifetime GAS consumed:\n6 month GAS consumed:\n% of protocol usage on Arbitrum:\nProject Treasury Size currently:\nToken Pool depth on Arbitrum:\nToken Utility:\nARB utility plan:\n\nSwaps will be executed through Hedgey Finance\u2019s Token Swap solution, the most used DAO token swap solution.\n\n**Note: If insufficient projects are willing to participate in the exchange, we\u2019ll explore alternative eligibility requirements and submit an additional Snapshot vote to ratify these changes.**\n\n## Token Swap Budget\nThe Arbitrum Token Swap Pilot will have a Token Swap budget of up to 2M ARB, which the Pilot Council will manage through the MSS multi-sig.\n\n* The initial pilot program is anticipated to conduct between 3-7 token swaps.\n* Each swap is capped at a maximum of 500,000 ARB, comparable to some previous swaps executed on Arbitrum One by GMX and its partners.\n* The minimum swap size will be 100,000 ARB.\n\n*Non-Sales Clause*\nArbitrum DAO and the third-party DAO will swap tokens with a 3-month lock. After the three month lock, the tokens will unlock 10% monthly for ten months. If no Arbitrum Treasury Management team is in place within nine months of executing the token swaps, the Pilot team will propose a solution for managing these tokens before they unlock.\n\nAll tokens received by Arbitrum will be kept in its main Treasury (0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58).\n\n## Pilot Program Implementation (timeline)\n\n*The Token Swap Pilot Council*\nThe initiative will comprise 3 voting members and 1 non-voting facilitating member.\n\nThe following 3 voting members are nominated as they provide a deep understanding of ArbitrumDAO and Token swaps.\n\n@LuukDAO, for producing the initial research and various Token Swaps programs\n@GFXlabs, for being an active LTIPP and STEP Council member\n@CastleCapital, for doing in-depth airdrop research and being an application advisor in LTIPP.\n\nThe non-voting member (except in case of a tie) will be Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability WG, lead by @thedevanshmehta, who supervised the token swap research and performed a similar role in the STEP program.\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-10-17 at 12.32.43 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeicm566ffdhysffcre4hwetcyuzevzv65e4mowilffslj2ys5f6vxe)\n    \n\n*Conflict of interest rules*\nThe dealmakers are not allowed to be involved in a token swap if they have direct or indirect exposure to the counterparty; this includes holding over 0,001% of the total supply of the token personally or through the affiliated company and having a direct, active working relationship with this protocol.\n\n## Program KPIs\nThis pilot\u2019s objective is to better understand the impact and logistics of DAO token swaps as a value-alignment tool for growing Arbitrum DAO\u2019s ecosystem.\nThe following KPIs are identified for the pilot:\n\n* Execute at least three swaps and document the process and learnings\n* Gain a better understanding of the change of behavior and perception of ecosystem players following a token swap with Arbitrum DAO\n* Provide a comprehensive summary of the pilot and support future incentive programs, allowing them to leverage Token Swaps in their program design.\n\n## Overall Cost\nTotal Cost: 2,130,000 ARB\n\n* Token Swap Budget: 2,000,000 ARB. The entire budget does not need to be spent. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\nImplementation Budget: 130,000 ARB. All staff involved are paid 3,500 ARB per week for their involvement.\n\n1.

Their adoption showed a good track record and believe they are a great addition to the Arbitrum ecosystem. We acknowledge there is a component of the grant that falls outside the scope of the program (10% towards developing the tBTC direct minting dapp), however, we felt the grant application was strong enough to allow this to pass on to the DAO and have them vote to allow this exception. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote AGAINST Threshold's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across rubric (execution, KPIs, milestones, grant justification, etc.). Only hold up is 10% being allocated as a developer grant and while not significant, this has disqualified other applications (for me) and do not want to make an exception here despite all other criteria passing with flying colors.\"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to aggressively grow the TVL of decentralized Bitcoin on Arbitrum, addressing liquidity provisioning, user stickiness, and direct minting functionalities. By incentivizing liquidity provision across key pools and implementing a tiered loyalty program, the protocol aims to attract and retain liquidity providers, thus deepening the liquidity pool on Arbitrum. Additionally, the integration of a direct minting DApp for Bitcoin on Arbitrum streamlines the process for BTC holders to access DeFi opportunities, fostering growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Overall, the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the ecosystem's needs and presents a well-thought-out plan to address them effectively, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nThreshold\u2019s application was very strong, they provided thorough details and justifications for their requested grant size, milestones, KPIs, and objectives. We really liked their execution strategy as it was well thought out and focused on incentivizing key areas such as liquidity, direct Arbitrum minting, and stickiness.\nTheir adoption on Arbitrum has been underwhelming, however, we believe it\u2019s important for the DAO to support such infrastructure that has already been successful on Mainnet and improve BTC alternatives.\nLastly, we appreciate their commitment to co-incentives during and 12 months after the LTIPP begins.

The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain. This will be helpful for newcomers, tooling providers, and experienced governooors alike.\n\nDAOstar received a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to improve the adoption of EIP-4824 in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are allocating a portion of that grant to steward this proposal. **Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.**\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is one of the largest DAOs, and there is a lot of data surrounding it. This dataset grows with every new initiative and has multiple components that may not be very visible from the \u201coutside\u201d. For example, consider the following questions:\n\n1. Who are the current Security Council, Arbitrum Research & Development Collective, Procurement Committee members? (Answer: you can search the respective forum post to find this)\n2. Can you share a location that tracks all DAO-owned/managed multisig addresses? (Answer: this could be https://www.arbwallets.xyz/)\n3. Can you share a status update on the DAO\u2019s grant spending? (Answer: R3gen Finance reports this on the forum)\n4. Where can we see delegate performance? (Answer: KarmaGAP or Tally)\n5. How much in sequencer fees is being collected? (Answer: there is a dashboard for this)\n6. What orbit chains exist? (Answer: the ecosystem page tracks this)\n7. Where to find recordings and transcripts of public meetings? (Answer: I\u2019m not sure!)\n\nFor an active participant, these answers might not be very hard. But for the majority of people who are not active participants of the DAO, and even for tooling providers, collecting this information requires a painstaking amount of manual effort. This leads to inconsistencies, errors and outdated information.\n\nThere are over 200 DAOs at the moment with a treasury size of over $1M, and collecting information on them manually is becoming an exponentially difficult task. EIP-4824 was authored by DAOstar with the support from the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Etherscan, DeepDAO, Snapshot, and a large number of DAO tooling companies, to create a better infrastructure for DAO data.\n\nAdopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. daoURIs have a standard JSON-LD format:\n\n\n```\n{\n\"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n\"type\": \"DAO\",\n\"name\": \"<name of the DAO>\",\n\"description\": \"<description>\",\n\"membersURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"proposalsURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"activityLogURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"governanceURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"contractsRegistryURI\": \"<URI>\"\n}\n```\n\nIt contains information on governance, members, activities and contracts by default. Outside of the endpoints mentioned above, a DAO can also choose to publish information that is specifically important to it. For Arbitrum, this could be information about orbit chains, different multi-sigs and councils, spending, sequencer fees, link to its constitution, etc. Essentially, **the daoURI creates an \u201cofficial repository\u201d of information on the DAO.**\n\nHere are some examples of how the daoURI could be used:\n\n1. It can be used to bring more context to contracts on block explorers. For example, we could go from this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigtmvyem5lo4vuyy33bac4cqqxd54qejrk5popmitan546oicaxey)\n    \nto this:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeiacscrrfv5itmx7b53ckjju4qatmldxksobzwdm7eg7xbovm7dhx4)\n    \n2. We can make DAO data easily and freely available to everyone\n\nFor example, Arbitrum DAO\u2019s current DeepDAO profile misses a ton of info - contracts, or revenue, or governance guardrails (councils and multi-sigs), etc. Messari\u2019s Arbitrum DAO dashboard requires a paid membership to access, which could also be due to the difficulty of collecting and presenting DAO data (thus making it too valuable to give away for free). By making access to this information easy, we can greatly improve the DAO\u2019s transparency. i.e, go from: \n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeicfctlylbtxcwbb3rwms4ncpu7ndnlc5lzbuojyeb3hk66xmzwdci)\n    \nto this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeihgmwshgkkfsnvhlc2ukbzcdpj3dj6hrhx3wmke33zl3kwn5pidvu)\n    \n\n3. daoURI makes it much easier to structure metadata improvements.\n\nA specific example that surfaced during Arbitrum GovHack (*thanks to Paulo Fonseca)*: onchain proposals at Arbitrum DAO (or any DAO for that matter) do not reference a forum discussion. This takes away a lot of available information. If we wanted to change this, we could achieve it easily by enforcing a discussionURI field inside the proposalURI (which is a standard component of daoURI). Tally, Aragon, Snapshot X, and most governance tooling providers are members of DAOstar. Extending the standard will create an easy upgrade pathway for them and this change would reflect the change across the ecosystem.\n\nTo summarize, a daoURI creates a source of truth for metadata, that can represent the present state of the DAO, and is easily accessible for onchain and offchain tools. This proposal carries no additional cost, or changes to any existing smart contract or process. It's a step in the right direction with no downside.\n\n### Specifications\n\nExecution is a simple contract call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory which deploys a new registration contract that\u2019ll store the daoURI. The registration will be on Arbitrum One network, setting the DAO\u2019s Governor timelock as admin, and managers as the DAO decides.\n\nA DAO that runs the same configuration as Arbitrum DAO and has adopted EIP-4824 is Unlock Protocol.

It is a public-access metagovernance block. With the aim of enfranchising the tens of thousands of small voters, this proposal suggests we delegate (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a 1 year renewal. This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass and Gitcoin Pass holders functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore more incentive to express their voices. The Gitcoin DAO has [recently passed](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8) a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the #6 delegate on Gitcoin. \n\nWe also request a grant of 50k ARB to help the team maintain this public good across this 1 year experiment in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket for the Arbitrum community over the past several months. \n\n## Problem\n\nToday, typical Arbitrum voter participation rate floats in the low single digits. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Not voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ARB doesn\u2019t make sense, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation: our average participation rate is 30%.\n\n## Mechanism\n\nArbitrum Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks to be implemented soon after delegation. As detailed further below, this model:\n\n1. Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means\n2. Incentives participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards\n3. Incentives participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain\n\nDAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn\u2019t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.\n\nIn this regard, Event Horizon slots into the Arbitrum ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.\n\nThis serves two functions:\n\n1. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.\n2. It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to participation is lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who do vote, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who don\u2019t vote to those who do.\n\nWhen participation is low\u2026 each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\nWhen participation is high\u2026 there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.\n\nWhere Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. \n\nBecause the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon\u2019s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.\n\n## Rationale\n\n7,000,000 ARB would place the Event Horizon community as the 15th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.\n\n## Benefits compared to Token Incentivized Governance:\n\nWhile token rewards for participation hold legitimate merit and are an intuitive remedy for low turnout, it has limitations.\n\nMisaligned Incentives: Token-based incentives attract returns-interested parties. However, when it comes to governance, participation is most valuable when it comes from those interested in participating not payout. Implicit delegation directly appeals to these individuals as it rewards those who participate, not with capital, but with greater voting power.\n\nAdded Thought Capital: in line with the notion above, there are likely thousands, of community members each holding both strong ideas and valuable contributions for the ecosystem, but simply lack enough voice to justify participation. Through Implicit Delegation, any community member of the Arbitrum ecosystem has an opportunity to have their voice heard, bringing thousands more minds and ideas to the surface.\n\nInflationary: While token rewards drive participation at the expense of inflation, Implicit delegation simply leverages its game theory model to increase incentive to vote in the form of a greater voting share. This does not cost the token any inflation, nor the treasury any ARB.\n\nNon-scalable: Token-based rewards are finite and require a constant drain of ARB funds to continue driving participation. As the ecosystem scales, and more participants join, greater and greater sums of ARB will be needed to continue fueling growth. Implicit delegation has no cost, and its balanced game theory functions with no burn. \n\n## Specification\n\n**Past Performance**\n\nThe above is not just theory. The Event Horizon community is already active on Ethereum providing meta-governing public goods to Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, ShapeShift, and of course, Arbitrum. In fact, in several recent Uniswap votes, the Event Horizon community was the 10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem. Event Horizon has also recently voted as the 8th largest delegate in recent Aave votes. Gitcoin DAO just voted to make Event Horizon the 6th largest delegate in the DAO via delegation.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.03.39 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeibev6xxizm6o3t75i6ykaepxsdsst7uusfhrfnjcg7dwdhweu76qe)\n    \nSince its inception, the Event Horizon protocol has placed over $28M of governance authority and enfranchisement directly into the hands of the citizen voter, a feat not seen anywhere else in the DAO space. Some more metrics worth highlighting:\n\nVotes Processed on Behalf of Retail voters: $28,000,000\nNumber of Metagovernance Proposals Passed: ~250\nVoter Participation: >30%\nAverage Authority Mobilized Multiple: >8,000x \n    \n## Mechanisms\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Duplication: Once a delegation is established, Event Horizon begins automatically duplicating all base DAO (in this case Arbitrum) proposals within its own voting portal.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.05.02 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeicutfnm3gvojnx6pfd6ei2omh2frxwzcasj6ujthwznw7pagwlm7e)\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Metagovernance: Retail voters may mint a free voter pass and begin voting to decide how the retail enfranchisement pool is mobilized in the base DAO proposal.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.05.29 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihuusuap534xe3r2mypdroiw4xri6orova73u62v6snbxvrsaqrpi)\n    \nStep 3 \u2013 Base DAO Voting: 24 hours prior to the closure of the base DAO proposal, the Event Horizon metagovernance proposal closes. Event Horizon then automatically pushes the consensus decision established by the retail community during the metagovernance proposal into the base DAO proposal.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.05.50 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiczmh4orexqbiafeecq2366glb5hqwtdhjqsr3w4sxtdj2mruudbm)\n \n## Steps to Implementation\n\nThe primary step to implementation would be the delegation and grant of ARB to the EventHorizonArbitrum.eth SAFE. After initial delegation from the DAO Event Horizon handles everything from there. Event Horizon will facilitate and maintain all elements of the pool from pass minting to metagovernance. \n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nThe Arbitrum Event Horizon Oversight Committee: A committee of 5 existing, notable delegates will be voted on by the Arbitrum community to be given the ability to guide the Event Horizon voting pool on matters of Arbitrum metagovernance. A simple 3/5 majority would allow this committee to veto the decisions of the voter pool within the 24 hours between the closing of the Event Horizon proposal, and the underlying DAO\u2019s proposal.\n\nWe also partnered with Gitcoin to add Gitcoin Passport requirements shortly after initial delegation to mitigate sybil risk.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "6ac1337f-de1f-45af-b1a6-5219a5814f70", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x871bf6b01d337db95c1ac85e6ea4c4d16391bcfa3d5091453f2bc5ff467a50cc", "title": "Prime Protocol STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0xF4B0556B9B6F53E00A1FDD2b0478Ce841991D8fA", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x871bf6b01d337db95c1ac85e6ea4c4d16391bcfa3d5091453f2bc5ff467a50cc", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [50437330.922612846, 16619309.039355423, 45556151.80433147], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.443", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

As the leading scaling solution across most notable metrics and one of the most active governance ecosystems, it is also important for the Arbitrum DAO to lead the industry in terms of professionalism and transparency.\n\nEstablishing clear and strict rules of conduct can be challenging and even counterproductive; therefore, the primary goal of the Delegate Code of Conduct is to help the Arbitrum DAO foster a culture of transparency, integrity, and civility. The Code of Conduct is a set of written principles that Arbitrum Delegates should embody. Delegates should use their best discretion and act in a way that aligns with the Code's spirit, rather than seeking to exploit loopholes or ambiguities.\n\n## The Arbitrum DAO Delegate Code of Conduct\n\n### Values Alignment\n\nArbitrum Delegates should always strive to uphold the seven community values stated in the Arbitrum Constitution. \n\n* **Ethereum-aligned:** Arbitrum is part of the Ethereum ecosystem and community\n* **Sustainable:** Focus on long-term health of the protocol over short-term gains\n* **Secure:** Arbitrum is security minded\n* **Socially inclusive:** Open and welcoming to all constructive participants\n* **Technically inclusive:** Accessible for ordinary people with ordinary technology\n* **User-focused:** Managed for the benefit of all users\n* **Neutral and open:** Foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition\n\n### Good Faith and Best Interest\n\n* Delegates should conduct themselves with honesty, integrity, and transparency, fostering trust and confidence among community members.\n* Delegates should act and vote in accordance with what they see is in the best interests of Arbitrum, which encompasses but is not limited to all of the following: Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, the Orbit Ecosystem, the ARB token, and any future Arbitrum DAO-governed chains as outlined in the Arbitrum Constitution. \n\n### Due Care and Attention\n\n* Delegates should remain knowledgeable of developments in regards to Arbitrum DAO\u2019s initiatives and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. \n* Delegates should make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal before submitting their vote.\n* Delegates are advised to vote abstain when unable to conduct the necessary diligence to understand the proposals.\n\n### Civility and Professionalism\n\n* While separate from the Code of Conduct, delegates are expected to uphold the community guidelines for activity on the Arbitrum DAO forum and de-facto understood gathering places for the Arbitrum DAO, whether online or in-person.\n* Delegates should seek to create a respectful and inclusive environment for all community members, free from harassment and discrimination.\n  * Examples of unacceptable behavior include:\n    * Publicly or privately harassing or intimidating others\n    * Sharing someone's private information without their consent\n    * Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwanted advances\n    * Making insulting or derogatory comments about others\n * Delegates should strive to provide constructive feedback that is well-researched and respectful, focusing on the proposal's merits. Personal attacks are never acceptable.\n* Delegates should be open-minded and respectful of differing viewpoints, even if they disagree with them. Disagreements are an inevitable part of healthy debate, but they often yield positive results when approached in a civil manner.\n* Delegates should make a best effort to provide constructive feedback through appropriate channels and avoid taking discussions to social media in a manner that could tarnish Arbitrum DAO\u2019s brand and reputation.\n\n### Responsibility\n\n* Maintaining a culture of productive debate, integrity, and transparency requires a sense of collective responsibility. As entrusted leaders of the Arbitrum community, delegates should take responsibility in fostering and maintaining a culture that promotes the principles outlined herein.\n* Best practices of responsible delegates:\n  * **Participation:** delegates should make an effort to vote (even if abstain) on all proposals.\n  * **Communication:** delegates should clearly communicate their rationale behind votes and discussions to the Arbitrum community.\n  * **Accountability:** delegates should maintain knowledge of funded initiatives and hold managing parties or elected representatives accountable.\n  * **Responsiveness:** delegates should use their best efforts to connect with the Arbitrum community and be accessible to answer questions or concerns.\n\n### Conflicts of Interest\n\n**Disclosure and Transparency Policy:** If a conflict of interest exists, it is expected the delegate discloses the nature and extent of the conflict in writing on the forum before voting. While it may not always be clear if an individual stands to gain \u201cdirectly\u201d or \u201cindirectly\u201d, it is recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency.\n\nDelegates that disclose a conflict of interest are not expected to alter their voting in any way. However, as explained further below, a delegate that repeatedly fails to disclose a conflict of interest before self-voting or if a single instance is deemed to be severe, they risk being removed from the Delegate Incentive Program or a DAO-elected position.\n\n### Conflict Resolution and Enforcement\n\nThe Code of Conduct has been purposefully written in a manner to establish a set principles that Arbitrum Delegates should embody rather than a complete set of enforceable rules.\n\n**Conflict Resolution between Delegates**\n\nIn general, it is our belief that many conflict issues can be resolved quickly and easily if approached in good faith by each party. Delegates and community members are encouraged to first address the behavior directly in private. If the matter is unable to be resolved for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it to the Arbitrum Foundation using this form.\n\n**Soft-Enforcement of the Delegate Code of Conduct**\n\nWhile it is not feasible to hold every governance participant accountable for upholding these principles, the DAO can hold accountable delegates compensated or individuals it elects to positions of power. \n\n**Delegate Incentive Program Removal**\n\nAs stated in the Delegate Incentive Program proposal, the program administrator reserves the right to issue a suspension or permanent ban if a delegate does not meet the eligibility requirements, which includes upholding the Code of Conduct. \n\n**DAO-Elected Position Removal**\n\nAny DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove a DAO-elected representative. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. \n\n## Standardizing the DAO\u2019s Operations\n\n### Voting Schedule\n\nAs ratified in a Snapshot vote to improve predictability in the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s operations, delegates agree to abide by the vote scheduling guidelines. \n\n### Election Standards\n\nThe Responsible Voting policy is an effort to strike a balance between preventing delegates from unfavorably electing themselves into a position of power and compensation while allowing them to still effectively represent their communities and tokenholders. In a normal election with multiple seats, the policy is simple: candidates may vote for themselves as long as they also cast votes to fill all the remaining positions. With token and weighted voting, there are additional nuances and guidelines must be set in place to address edge scenarios.\n\n**Shielded Elections with Weighted Voting:** A few weeks ago the Entropy team posted a temperature check to gauge the DAO\u2019s stance on shielded voting. The results indicated that a slight majority of delegates favored the use of shielded voting as the default for elections. In order to align with Security Council elections, weighted voting as opposed to approval voting will be the official default voting type.\n\n**Minimum Application Period:** In order to draw a sufficient number of high quality applicants, application periods should be a minimum of 14 days.\n\nWhere n = number of seats; proposal authors should seek to have at least n+3 applicants before starting the election. Since this may not always be possible, it is simply a recommendation and not a requirement.\n\n### Delegating to the Arbitrum Exclude Address\n\nARB tokens allocated to DAO initiatives are not to be used in governance. To keep circulating voting supply from increasing, whenever possible, multi-sigs holding program funds should delegate to the Arbitrum Exclude Address. This will prevent tokens from being included in quorum calculations. \n\n## Timeline\n\nBefore codifying the Arbitrum Code of Conduct and updates to the DAO\u2019s operations into the Arbitrum Constitution, we believe it is best to trial the changes for a period of 6 months post ratification of this proposal. At which point, any necessary changes or delegate feedback can be incorporated. Depending on sentiment and the changes made, the trial period can be extended another 6 months or a constitutional proposal can be put forth to update the language of the Constitution.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "6d7e34cb-8ca3-4b47-88cd-55a108ef93be", "proposal_id": "3135e14f-c274-4b6b-aeb9-edf0ccbe5892", "snapshot_id": "0x5e0057920df9a278918e4de4ee1e6de7e2415d2af985e40a6c7a1a4b47a4ce01", "title": "Arbitrum Short-term incentive Program", "author_name": "0xF92F185AbD9E00F56cb11B0b709029633d1E37B4", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5e0057920df9a278918e4de4ee1e6de7e2415d2af985e40a6c7a1a4b47a4ce01", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-09-11 03:58:28", "voting_end": "2023-09-18 03:58:28", "options": {"scores": [62609699.07880869, 119918144.1295113, 0, 0], "choices": ["Up to 25M ARB through Jan 2024", "Up to 50M ARB through Jan 2024", "Up to 75M ARB through Jan 2024", "Against"]}, "last_activity": "2023-09-18 03:58:28", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.633", "body": "Note: This proposal has been posted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n**Abstract**\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created program to distribute up to 75,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through the January 31, 2024. It asks all participating grantees to self report data, and dashboards, summarizing grant performance.\n\n**Motivation**\nThis provisional framework aims to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed (1 19, 2 7, 3 4, 4 5).\nThe goals of the program are to:\n\u2022\tSupport Network Growth: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n\u2022\tExperiment with Incentive Grants: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\u2022\tFind new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n\u2022\tCreate Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n**Rationale**\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n**Specifications**\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 75,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n \n![8b05a5d34faf8659a144f1d35081a89ae83e237e.png](ipfs://bafkreiaizvrpzwo5bn6lxl5ikdywhfakyphtdukgkywpuzpvlrokaaj2oe)\n     \nFollowing a successful Snapshot Temperature Check, the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check will be designed to both achieve consensus and approve funding across four options, where each vote will distinguish support of up to X ARB through the end of January 31, 2024:\n\u2022\tFor up to **25M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n\u2022\tFor up to **50M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n\u2022\tFor up to **75M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n\u2022\tAgainst.\n\n**Financial Proposal**\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n\u2022\tA ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and application template 37 as articulated in this document.\n\u2022\tApproval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n\u2022\tA 25,000,000, 50,000,000 or 75,000,000 ARB distribution to the program Multisig.\n\u2022\tA 32,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\no\t20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n\uf0a7\tDraft and review of multiple iterations of incentive proposals.\n\uf0a7\tModeration of community calls and working group telegram.\n\uf0a7\tCoordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\no\t12,000 ARB Multisig Signers (A new version of the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig 17 - 2K per signer).\n\n**Multisig Setup**\nA new multisig will be created with the signers from the original pl-ARB multisig, under the name of the Arbitrum DAO. The new multisig will include two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1.\tClawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2.\tStreaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n**What are the Eligibility Requirements?**\n\nGrant Requirements:\n\u2022\tGrantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n\u2022\tGrantees must not farm their own incentive programs.\n\u2022\tGrantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant\u2019s objective.\n\u2022\tGrantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard or alternatively in a report.\n\u2022\tGrantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n\u2022\tGrantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n\u2022\tGrantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n\u2022\tGrants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n\u2022\tGrantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n\u2022\tGrantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n\u2022\tGrantees must apply using the approved program application template 15.\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n\u2022\tAny use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n\u2022\tFailure to comply with data reporting standards.\no\tGrantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n\u2022\t\u2022\tDashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n\u2022\t\u2022\tMore granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\no\tIf dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n**Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines**\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there\u2019s no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n\u2022\t**Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\uf0a7\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n\uf0a7\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\uf0a7\t.> $1.5M TVL.\n\uf0a7\t.>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n\u2022\t**Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\uf0a7\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n\uf0a7\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\uf0a7\t.> $4M TVL.\n\uf0a7\t.>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n\u2022\t**Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\uf0a7\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n\uf0a7\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\uf0a7\t.> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n\uf0a7\t.> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n\u2022\t**Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\uf0a7\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n\uf0a7\tMeets one of the following criteria\n\uf0a7\t.> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n\uf0a7\t.> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\n*Grants greater than $1M ARB will be asked to include milestone-based funding tranches in their application.\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n**Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?**\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\nCycle 1\n1.\tApplication Period (1 Week):\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the \u201cIncentive Grant Applications\u201d Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application Template 20.\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2.\tReview Period (1 Week):\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3.\tVoting Period (1 Week):\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the PL-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\nCycle 2\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n**Timeline**\n[See image above]\nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 09, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\n\nCycle 1\nSep. 16, 2023 - On-Chain Vote and Application Period\nSep. 23, 2023 - Review Period Begins\nSep. 30, 2023 - Voting Round Begins\nOct. 07, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\nCycle 2\nOct 07, 2023 - Application Period 2 Begins\nOct 14, 2023 - Review Period 2 Begins\nOct 28, 2023 - Voting Round 2 Begins\nNov. 04, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\n**Overall Cost**\nUp to 75,032,000 ARB.\n\n**Outstanding Questions and Concerns**\n\nWhat happens if the budget is exceeded?\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 75M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\nWhat will happen to excess funds?\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\nWhat is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of allowing incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\nWhat are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?\n\u2022\tCommunity Support: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n\u2022\tNetwork Activity: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n\u2022\tCommunity Awareness: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n\u2022\tIncentives Data: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n**Forum Link **\n\nThis snapshot is replication of the forum post.

This event aims to foster education and innovation within the Ethereum community.\nHaving engaged in events like, ETHMexico, #RoadToDevcon and EthLATAM since June 2022, Ethereum Mexico wants to move beyond just market talk and truly display Ethereum\u2019s transformative power.\n\nTo gain insights into our previous achievements, please review our metrics here: [Ethereum M\u00e9xico comunidad - Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dZMfscIjI2z48pGkG3Lr_IyqpX-ONcfqUy7f7ddPbf4/edit)\n\n### Motivation:\nThe project is fueled by a pressing need to fill the educational and resource gap in Mexico concerning Ethereum and blockchain technology. It aims to create a more inclusive and diverse Ethereum community in Mexico, thereby contributing to the global Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum Mexico is not just another crypto initiative; it\u2019s a mission-driven project that focuses on real-world impact. Far from falling into speculative conversations, it aims to educate people about the transformative power of Ethereum as public infrastructure.\n\n### Primary Objectives:\n\n* To educate individuals about the safe and effective use of blockchain technology, focusing on the Ethereum ecosystem.\n* To disseminate the core values and tools of Ethereum and Web3 to a broader audience.\n* To provide unwavering support and assistance to local communities in conceptualizing, building, and scaling Ethereum-related projects.\n* Establishing strong collaborations with the Arbitrum Foundation and other key stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n### Format of the event:\nOur one-day event will feature a diverse range of talks, workshops, and community showcases. With its significance in the local Web3 scene, we anticipate the event will generate substantial activity in Mexico City, including various side events. Leading up to the main event, we will also host multiple gatherings in different cities to foster networking among local communities.\n\n### Expected Audience:\n\n* Developers\n* End users\n* Potential contributors\n\n### Confirmed Sponsors:\n\n* Ethereum Foundation\n* Ledger\n* Metapool\n* Liquity\n\n### Deliverables:\n\n1.

The program has evolved and improved based on previous results, growing from its first season, which allocated $250,000 across four domains, to a second season with funding of $1,000,000 per domain.\n\nWe are now proposing a third season that would run for a full year, encompassing the existing four domains (Protocols, Education/Community and Events, Dev Tooling, and Gaming) while potentially adding a fifth domain (Orbit). The vision is to create a modular program where new domains can be integrated over time based on DAO requirements and perceived needs. This new season will also improve tracking of grantee progress after funding and facilitate fast-tracking of exceptional projects into other DAO initiatives, such as Arbitrum Foundation programs and the GCP.\n\nQuestbook will serve as the technical partner of the program, offering their services through the Questbook.app portal.\n\n\n## Season 1 and 2 recap\nSeason 1 of the Grant Program was initiated through an RFC in [April 2023](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/14081?u=jojo), designed to serve four distinct domains: New Protocols and Ideas, Dev Tooling, Education/Community/Events, and Gaming. Following a successful [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe07fb357b2b40e042ca58a36a1534afc33a1d313d4781ac433536bc884fc3c65) and [tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/52789605232046584393223454610845077119190920888046802640362214067679574612119?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) vote along with elections for the four DAs, the program officially launched in October 2023. The team consisted of [JoJo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo/summary), [SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov/summary), [Flook](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/flook/summary), and [Juandi](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/juandi/summary) as Domain Allocators, with [Srijith](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/srijith-questbook/summary) serving as Program Manager.\n\nThe first season operated for six months with a budget of $250,000 per domain, totaling $1 million in funding, and implemented a soft cap of $25,000 per project. In April 2024, the program was [renewed](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98446466630612736687159241204141593794174501692677162686607521796118942563659?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) for Season 2 with the same team but expanded funding to $1,000,000 per domain. The soft cap was increased to $50,000, with proposals exceeding $25,000 requiring evaluation from two Domain Allocators.\n\nSeason 2 has now completed its fund allocation phase and will continue operating at reduced capacity for the next six months to oversee milestone completion and grant disbursement. Bear in mind that Season 2 results are partial from the first 6 months, and it will have its natural end in May 2025.\n\nThe following are the numbers so far achieved:\n\n* **Season 1**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 67\n    * Amount of completed projects: 49 / 73%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 8 / 12%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 6 / 9%\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 4 / 6%\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 207\n    * Amount of completed milestones 178 / 86%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 23 / 11%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $997,793\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $852,781 / 86%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $87,512 / 8.5%\n\n*Note: Uncompleted projects are those currently active but were either unable to complete their proposals within the last six months or pivoted to a different idea. Abandoned projects are from teams that weren't able to operate in the market. Withdrawn projects are those that were approved but decided not to proceed with their grant.*\n*While there was no specific timeline set, we feel Season 1 has come to its natural end, and we are in the process of informing teams and withdrawing remaining funds.*\n\n* **Season 2**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 127\n    * Amount of completed projects: 42 / 33%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 85 / 67%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 0\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 0\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 451\n    * Amount of completed milestones 240 / 53%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 211 / 47%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $2,602,247\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $1,356,181 / 44%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $1,246,066 / 41%\n\nMore details on the results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ts3oUeRy5cMp-5ksyld570VhmdjdUEVvtt2VhUYxfc4/edit?gid=1462691949#gid=1462691949).\n\n\n\n## Season 3: overview\n\nIn the last year, and potentially for the next year, the D.A.O. Grant Program has brought and will continue to bring the following value to the DAO:\n\n1. Introductory Grant Program: It fills the gap of Arbitrum Foundation grants (usually starting at $50,000, up to $150,000), serving as an entry-level program in our ecosystem.\n2. Transparency: All applications and judgments are available for everyone to read in the portal. Additionally, discussions with protocols are typically maintained in a public Discord with open access.\n3. Targeted Approach: The program has specialized in four specific verticals deemed key by the DAO\n4. High submission amount: between Season 1 and 2 we managed more than 700 proposals, approving around 200.\n\nWhile these points have always been advocated and envisioned as the natural shape of the program, below is a non-comprehensive list of value propositions that has been provided so far through in the last two seasons of the program:\n\n* Enable new teams and small builders to bootstrap their projects\n* Enable mid and big team to prioritize certain deployment in Arbitrum\n* Support Hackathon and Event winners\n* Provide an alternative funding route alongside the Arbitrum Foundation or direct DAO proposals\n* Support projects building upon targeted DAO initiatives\n* Ensure builder diversity, enlarging indirectly Arbitrum mindshare for local builders.\n\nA few specific examples of what we think can be defined as success stories:\n\n* Season 2 has supported both the [winner](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) and [runner-up](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f30eb1c1eb9145098a15e&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66bbd4ee8868f5130a6ffe57&isRenderingProposalBody=true) of Arbitrum GovHack at EthCC\n* Curia's [Governance Dashboard](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66bdceb58868f5130a8cd78d&isRenderingProposalBody=true), initially [rejected](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x573c74706924ce482080ba44deb77d75e8d6bdb516fbbdee54b78861c1683f1b) by the DAO, has been later approved through the grant program with a 20% cost reduction\n* Pear Protocol, currently trading at $7.5M market cap with a $160M cumulative volume in 60 days in the perp space, received a grant to develop their [API module](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x538&isRenderingProposalBody=true) for market makers\n* Mountain protocol, rwa protocol having around $10M in liquidity in Arbitrum, has [bootstrapped its activity in Arbitrum through a grant ](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x4ee&isRenderingProposalBody=true)in Season 1\n* Vyper, a language with an extreme mindshare in the Ethereum community, has seen [support to their compiler in Season 2](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f32a15488d5000f0562b3&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66a4e20af2fef64647207b3d&isRenderingProposalBody=true), which will help securing hundreds of millions in DeFi applications\n* Applications like FairAI's are building on top of initiatives such as LTIPP and STIP.b to improve the [discoverability of projects with incentives](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=663ec3d47d71679fa9a3852c&isRenderingProposalBody=true).\n\nIn this new iteration, the DA program will last one year. After two six-month seasons with subsequent renewals, there is sufficient maturity in both the program and the DAO to extend it, reducing the burden on delegates for operational renewal and addressing issues such as gaps between seasons.\n\nFunding will be proportional to Season 2, which effectively allocated $750,000 for each of the four domains for six months: for a one-year program, **the funding for the four domains will be $1,500,000 per domain, for a total of $6,000,000 for the four domains excluding OpEx**. Additionally, after discussions with several delegates and the Foundation, and assessment of the current DAO landscape and working groups, there is interest in a potential fifth domain related to Orbit chains. Acknowledging its experimental nature, the proposal suggests funding this domain with half the amount of other domains: $750,000 for one year.\n\nThe grant structure will remain unchanged. Grantees can request up to $25,000 with a single DA review, and up to $50,000 with two DA reviews. Grants will be paid on a milestone basis, where projects must first complete the milestone, verify it with the DA, and then receive the corresponding portion of the grant. Only in exceptional cases, such as when milestone funds are essential for completion or in situations of economic distress, may the DA, at their discretion, release milestone funds in advance.\n\nUpon completing KYC/KYB, grantees will have up to six months to complete their proposal. If they fail to do so, remaining funds will be retained by the program and either reassigned to new projects or, if the program has naturally concluded, returned to the DAO.\n\nUpon proposal completion, grantees must publish a final report in the Arbitrum forum to inform the general DAO community about their project.\n\nThree months after proposal completion, grantees must complete a survey and publish an update to their final report, aimed at tracking their success, foothold gained in Arbitrum, and adherence to or pivot from their original idea.\n\nBefore completion, a subset of projects will be internally selected by the PM and DAs for fast-tracking through a PM pitch into other ecosystem programs, such as the Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program or the GCP. While this won't necessarily guarantee further grants from these or other entities, it will ensure exceptional protocols can continue their journey and expand within the ecosystem.\n\nWith these modifications, several gaps from previous seasons are addressed:\n\n1. Creating a checkpoint for approved proposals after their final milestone: This will enable better overall tracking of project outcomes.\n2. Integrating exceptional projects into DAO growth programs to establish a clear pathway for continued development within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## Program phases\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibao77we73buy5735xsaeudsadh2j23rpkmclftijsgnwfgin2ndu)\n\nExcluding the initial phases of snapshot discussion, temp check on the proposal, candidacy for DAs, elections for DAs, and on-chain vote, the program is articulated in the following phases:\n1. A first 1 year phase: during these 12 months, funds allocated to the program will be assigned to DAs to the projects that will be evaluated as worth financing. During this phase, the green one in the graph, all the team will operate at full capacity.\n2. A second phase, at low capacity, lasting 6 months: this phase is also effectively already embedded in phase 1. During this 6 months we will assume that there won't be any new fund to distribute from the main phase, and it will be a monitoring one. As stated, grantees, once approved and kyced, will have *up to* 6 months to complete their project. This means that projects approved, for example, in the last legal month of phase 1, will be able to complete their path up to 6 months after the end of phase 1. In this period, the team will work at low capacity, with a 20% cost.\n3. A third phase, potentially extending up to 3 months after the end of phase 2, related to the checkmark of projects after completion. If we consider a project that gets approved in the last month of phase 1, and needs 6 months to arrive to completion (so is completed in the last month of phase 2), we will necessarily have to place the checkmark 9 months after the legal completion of phase 1. Note: there is no opex coverage for this phase, since is effectively based on contacting projects, interviewing them likely with a google form and report in the forum, but only as said for projects that were approved in the last quarter of phase 1 AND that requires 6 months for completion (which is not always the case). This phase will be covered through the team which will have the goodwill of finishing to accompany projects in their path, and could potentially be resolved through the passing of the baton to a new team, or confirmation of the old team, in a season 4.\n\nDuring all of these phases, there will be parallel communication phases related to\n- the communication and reporting of the program in the forum: we need to, indeed, cover this for 12 + 6 + 3 months of the program\n- the communication with Arbitrum Foundation: as stated, upon completion, best of breed projects will be pitched to the AF to have them continue their journey in the Arbitrum ecosystem, either through a grant, or marketing, or any other initiative that the AF might deem necessary, knowing that this internal pitch might not necessarily spark any follow up\n- the communication with GCP, in the same fashion of the AF, once the fund will have their thesis and infrastructure up\n- any communication with any other stakeholder or initiative that might be deemed relevant by the team or the DAO.\n\n## Domains\n\nSo far the program has run with four main domains:\n\n1. New Protocols and Ideas: A general bucket encompassing not only protocols, but also platforms, governance tooling, and other projects not specifically falling into other domains.\n2. Education, Community Growth and Events: A domain focused on physical events and educational material for Arbitrum.\n3. Dev Tooling on One and Nova: A technical domain oriented toward developer tooling and promoting Arbitrum Nova adoption.\n4. Gaming: A domain dedicated to web3 gaming and infra, web3 KOL gaming activities, and all video gaming-related projects.\n\nAll these domains remain pillars of our DAO today, even more so than a year ago. We are, for better or worse (though mostly better), the most accessible DAO in crypto, the first ecosystem to create a gaming fund of the size of GCP, and we have a technology stack that enables permissionless creation of L3s. Our ecosystem's nature and soul, combined with the entry-level grant structure of this program and the diversity we inevitably achieve through it, provides strong justification to maintain all four domains. While most operational changes will be in the framework that moves projects from this program to others, we plan to specify domains based on relevant stakeholders\u2019 feedback (Arbitrum Foundation, OCL, Delegates) to add more specificity and better tailored results.\n\n### Education, Community Growth and Events\n\nThe domain has seen significant attention, receiving the highest number of proposals in both seasons. Through discussions with Foundation members and key stakeholders, two additional focus areas have emerged where the grant program can provide value:\n\nEvents Focus:\n\n* While continuing to serve the broader community, emphasis will be placed on amplifying Arbitrum's presence in key global markets and events\n* This will complement the Foundation's growth efforts in specific regions such as, in random order, SEA, USA, LatAm and others\n* The program will maintain an open approach, not limiting itself to these regions\n* Regular coordination with the Foundation's marketing department will help identify synergies between grantee proposals and events organized by the Foundation or other key ecosystem players\n* The DA will be mindful about any request of grantees for presence of personnel of the Arbitrum Foundation in the events: while this can, in some cases, be accommodated, is not always possible.\n\nDeveloper Relations:\n\n* Increased focus on DevRel content for both One and Stylus\n* Examples include, but are not limited to, video tutorials\n* Goal is to foster technology stack adoption through expanded community-created educational materials\n* This branch can partially overlap with and be covered/complemente by the Dev Tooling domain.\n\nTo reiterate: the domain won\u2019t change its nature to only serve requests such as the one mentioned in the above examples, but might give in some cases more weights in the evaluation as there is value added in coordination with the broad ecosystem. The DA will still retain all its liberty of evaluation.\n\n### Gaming\n\nThe gaming vertical has gained increased attention throughout the year in Arbitrum, partly due to the GCP initiative. Key stakeholders, including OCL, have identified a primary need: Arbitrum Games should begin targeting the web2 gaming industry, creators and gamers.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the grantee budget cap of $50,000 isn't sufficient to attract web2 developers, we can broaden the domain's scope by focusing on user acquisition through initiatives such as:\n\n* Content creation for YouTube and TikTok\n* Twitch streams\n* Other KOL initiatives targeting the web2 gaming segment\n* Grant proposal tuned toward KPI such as amount of reach, target impressions and others\n* Independent publications like newsletters, blogs, and channels.\n\nImportant notes:\n\n* The domain, while expanding, will still maintain its existing focus, which is financing teams to bootstrap or expand web3 games, web3 game related infrastructure and web3 gaming services in the Arbitrum ecosystem while expanding to include these new initiatives\n* Success on the expanded scope will largely depend on selecting a strong candidate or team with specific experience and reach in this segment\n* These requirements will be reflected in the election criteria.\n\n### Dev Tooling on One and Stylus\n\nThe Dev Tooling will undergo changes based on what the Arbitrum ecosystem has achieved, both technologically and in terms of PMF, in the last 12 months.\n\nNova, initially included in the scope, hasn\u2019t seen the forecasted adoption. At the same time we have seen a big conviction bet on Stylus.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t make sense to exclude specifically Nova, it can\u2019t be anymore one of the focus of the domain, which will be now called \"Dev Tooling on One and Stylus,\" incorporating the recent Stylus release. There shouldn\u2019t be any consistent overlap with the current year-long \"Stylus Spring\" program for several reasons:\n\n* Different funding amounts (up to $50,000 in DA program vs. potentially $200-500,000 for Stylus Sprint)\n* Different application windows (always open in DA program vs. 8-weeks application period in Stylus Spring)\n* Broader scope (Dev Tooling domain will likely continue to primarily operate on Arbitrum One).\n\nThe rubric will also be modified to put emphasis on Telegram\u2019s tooling such as trading bots, fairly available in other ecosystems but less widespread in Arbitrum.\n\n### New Protocols and Ideas\n\nThe \"New Protocols and Ideas\" domain will remain the most general capture-oriented domain, as it has been in the last two seasons. Its inherent generality enables it to cover both classic ideas, like financing DeFi protocols, and DAO-specific needs like governance tooling. This domain will remain largely unchanged, except for maintaining constant alignment with the Foundation and other stakeholders on what is considered important and valuable when assigning grants. Additionally, there will be attention paid to the evolving narratives driving the broader market.\n\n### Orbit Chains\n\nThere has been growing interest in a possible fifth domain related to Orbit chains. Many delegates have shown interest in or directly requested funding for an Orbit chains program, which is also supported by the existing [working group](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-as-the-home-of-builders-embracing-chain-abstraction/27250?u=jojo).\n\nThe Orbit Chains domain will have the mission to:\n\n* Enable Arbitrum protocols to expand their dApps to specific Orbit chains\n* Deploy technological solutions aimed at addressing current user experience fragmentation\n* Bootstrap solutions built on top of the [2024-2025 Offchain Labs roadmap](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/your-chain-your-rules-offchain-labs-technical-roadmap-to-fuel-arbitrum-innovation-f787f2e85966).\n\nThe Orbit chain domain won\u2019t cover the deployment of new Orbit chains, since this is a mission that is currently facilitated by the Foundation. This doesn\u2019t mean that a project can\u2019t have, in its milestone, the deployment of its own chain if that is part of a broader plan; but this can\u2019t be the main focus of the proposal.\n\nThe rubric and template will be drafted in detail with the elected team member, following the same process used for the other domain rubrics ([1](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66f2dec58868f5130ac75e42), [2](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Domain-Allocator-info-0b00ff3a2ec4436f8fb5298c60c57b32), [3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt), [4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit?tab=t.0)).\n\nAcknowledging that the DAO might consider it premature to launch an Orbit domain, particularly before seeing results from the related working group, the snapshot will provide an option to exclude it from the current program. This domain could then be integrated later during the program's one-year duration.\nAs for the current iteration, we propose [MaxLomu](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/maxlomu/summary) as lead for the Orbit domain. While we can accommodate the DAO's preference for elections in this domain, we believe there would be no better lead than him, given his background and current working group proposal.\n\n## Modularity\n\nSeveral parties have expressed interest in adding new domains to the DA program.\n\nWhile it wouldn't be wise to expand the program further at this time, new domains might be needed at different intervals, as illustrated by the Orbit domain example, where the DAO might require a new domain program six months from now. For this reason, Season 3 is designed to be modular.\n\nIf the DAO votes to allocate capital for a new domain, it can be integrated into the current program by leveraging the existing infrastructure and Program Manager. The costs for adding domains would vary based on specific implementation requirements:\n\n* For domains requiring no additional Questbook expansion and maintaining equivalent PM workload:\n  * Platform costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * PM costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * One new Domain Allocator required\n\nNote that:\n\n* New programs may operate with their own independent teams\n* Integration of the Orbit Chains domain, whether at the start of Season 3 or later, will not incur additional costs\n\n## What does success look like\n\nEvaluating success for an entry-level grant program can be challenging. The evaluation primarily focuses on three key metrics:\n\n1. **Number of Grant Applications**: The program has grown over the past two seasons with increased proposal submissions. We expect to maintain or exceed this level of interest. This KPI should be primarily compared to Season 2's metrics, as Season 1 had both lower funding and a lower cap ($25,000).\n2. **Grant Completion Rate**: As an entry-level program serving primarily small and new teams, the risk of incomplete projects is higher compared to more mature programs. The completion rate will largely depend on DAs' judgment in approving teams they trust to deliver. This metric should also be benchmarked against Season 2's performance for consistent comparison.\n3. **Long-term Project Sustainability**: A new metric will track how many teams are still building on their original project and remaining on Arbitrum three months after grant completion. As this is a new measurement not present in previous seasons, we won't have comparative data unless we retroactively measure Season 2 projects in nine months.\n\n## Election Process\n\nThe election process will follow established best practices as outlined in the [Code of Conduct](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2e701a942a8ed6f9ec8302cea866ab08648eeef0d07170814e3a3c3eb4e48415):\n\n* Two-week candidacy period\n* Candidates (person, entity or team) may apply for only one domain\n* Entities or Teams applying for any domain must designate a single individual as their point of contact\n* One-week snapshot election with shielded option enabled and weighted voting.\n\n## Resignation of DAs and PMs\n\nIn recognition that one year is a relatively long period for a DAO's program, procedures must be established for cases where team members cannot complete their tenure. If a member resigns, they will assist with the transition, and the team will attempt to source a replacement. A snapshot vote will be held with two options: \"Yes, proceed with the new member\" or \"No, hold elections.\"\n\nIf approved, the new member will be onboarded to the team. If rejected, a standard election process will occur over three weeks (two weeks for candidacy, one week for voting). During any transition period where the former member cannot fulfill their duties, the current DAs and PM will temporarily manage the domain, including grantee collaboration, proposal evaluation, and milestone payments. Any compensation due to the departing member during this interim phase will be fairly distributed among contributing team members.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe RFC will request $1,500,000 for each of the four domains \"New Protocols and Ideas\", \"Education, Community Growth and Events\", \"Dev Tooling on One and Nova\", and \"Gaming\", for a total amount of $6,000,000 excluding OpEx. The requested amount will be in ARB and, upon receiving, will be converted into USDC.\n\nEarmarked costs are as follows:\n\n* Questbook Platform: $84,000 total ($7,000/month for 12 months)\n  * Includes platform maintenance\n  * Synapse subscription for KYC/KYB of teams and grantees\n  * DocuSign subscription\n* Domain Allocator Compensation: $422,400 total\n  * $8,000/month for 12 months (four DAs)\n  * Plus $1,600/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n* Program Manager Compensation: $85,800 total\n  * $6,500/month for 12 months\n  * Plus $1,300/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n* Legal Expenses: $30,000 earmarked\n\nTotal operational costs: $622,200\n\nIf the Orbit Chains domain is added as a fifth domain:\n\n* Additional $750,000 to total budget\n* DA compensation of this domain remains unchanged\n* No additional PM or platform costs\n* Total program cost would increase to $727,800.\n\n*Note: If approved, JoJo will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2 at the start of Season 3. Similarly, if any of the current Domain Allocators will participate in the elections and will be re-elected, they will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2.*\n\n## Reporting\n\nA more clear and standardized reporting will take place going forward. Specifically\n\n* The PM will report, once per month, in the Arbitrum Governance call\n  * This type of reporting might change format and/or schedule: if the DAO is interested, for example, it could be a specific DA call, or it might fall into any of the new governance DAO\u2019s calls that we could change or spin up in future\n* The PM and the DAs will publish, once per month, a single unified report highlighting the status of the program\n* All grantees, of all domains, at completion will have to publish a report in the Arbitrum forum\n* All grantees will have to follow up the aforementioned report, after three months, with a survey prepared to understand the effectiveness of both the grant itself and the idea from the team, including but not only understanding if the team has decided to keep building in Arbitrum, expanding in other chains etcetera.\n\n## Vote specification\n\nThe DAO vote on Snapshot will be a single choice vote:\n\n* Yes: renew the program with $7,477,800 and 5 domains\n* Yes: renew the program with $6,622,200 and 4 domains\n* No: don\u2019t renew the program\n* Abstain\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n* 19th of November: RFC for Season 3 and discussion with the DAO\n* 5th of December: Snapshot for Season 3\n* 16th of December - 5th of January: candidacy for the domains\n* 9th of January - 16th of January: Snapshot elections for the domains\n* 23rd of January - 6th of February: Tally voting\n* First half of February: refinements of rubrics with the new team\n* Mid February: start of the program\n\n## Fund Management\n\nARB received from Tally, with a 35% buffer, will be transferred to the Arbitrum Foundation for the conversion in USDC of only the amount approved; any ARB surplus will be returned to the DAO. Upon completion, funds will be split as per the following\n\n* OpEx safe: managed by the MSS, it will be in charge of payment of suppliers and partners (Questbook, Synapse) and salaries\n* Domains\u2019 safes: managed by PM + DAs, one for each vertical with a 2/3 setup (the PM, the main DA, and a second different DA), will be linked to the specific domain through the Questbook website and will be used to disburse the grants. The safes will have the Zodiac Module for the clawback of funds.\n\n## Resources\n\n[Season 1 RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/14081)\n[Season 2 RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326)\n[Season 2 update thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-update-thread/23672)\n[New Protocols and Ideas RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/120s88WVycDyP2pUfgcT0eE8ILuribuayHDnd5aeZxbM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4th1bgre9sv4)\n[Education, Community Growth and Events RFP](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Domain-Allocator-info-0b00ff3a2ec4436f8fb5298c60c57b32)\n[Gaming RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt),\n[Dev Tooling on One and NOVA RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit?tab=t.0)", "match_confidence": 0.8535, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "70ec1605-b16a-4c16-b2bb-ad9c14863618", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xc84236bedf7a5ca1f6d7a44199a4d9755d94109c831e06c6735492fe6f7dfc8d", "title": "KelpDAO LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc84236bedf7a5ca1f6d7a44199a4d9755d94109c831e06c6735492fe6f7dfc8d", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [144383010.8065494, 25025.707995502213, 22617221.46710951], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.515", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/kelpdao-ltipp-application-draft/21976/2\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\n\nKelpDAO\u2019s application was very strong and scored well in most criteria.

(what do we include/exclude? discuss current initiatives or only big-picture stuff e.g. strategy, org design? single track or multi-track? etc.)\n- when should this happen?\n- how long should it last?\n- Who facilitates it?\n- What\u2019s the location (online/offline, which platform/venue)\n- Budget\n- etc etc.\n\nAnswering those questions will require engagement from the top delegates and project management work to take this from a loose idea to a refined proposal.\n\nSo before we commit to discussing the details, this temperature check aims to confirm whether delegates believe:\n\n- an Offsite proposal is something that should be explored\n- or we should shelve the idea, avoid wasting everyone\u2019s time and focus on something else.\n\n# IMPORTANT\n\nThis proposal is about polling whether top delegates are interested in the initiative.

Other major L2s have committed to adopting RIP-7212. Adding support for this precompile would enable account abstraction wallets to cheaply verify a type of signature widely used in passkeys and secure enclaves.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWallet security is one of the most prominent pain points for crypto users today. Adopting RIP-7212 will reduce the costs of using passkey-based wallets on Arbitrum One and Nova, making them more feasible for everyday use and enabling dApp developers and protocols to offer their users improved UX.\n\nPasskey-based wallets offer a better level of security than a typical EOA and seamless cross-device support. Specifically, adding this precompile will reduce the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve for account abstraction wallets. Passkeys offer a solution that removes the need for personally storing a private key. They leverage WebAuthn, a global standard for passwordless authentication used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and all major web browsers. The private key generated when creating a passkey can be encrypted and then stored in the iCloud Keychain (or the Android Keystore for Android devices). The decryption of the private keys happens in a specialized module located in every iPhone (and other smartphones) called the Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave ensures a user\u2019s private key can never leave the device, transforming a smartphone into a hardware wallet. Users can authorize transactions with biometric features like Touch ID or Face ID when using passkey-based wallets for key management. These qualities add flexibility and significantly improve UX while maintaining high security.\n\nEthereum currently has a precompile for the [secp25k1](https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/secp256k1_a_key%20algorithm_(explainCKBot)) curve, which all EOA wallets use as their signature scheme. Account abstraction wallets can use alternative signature schemes, such as the one that passkeys utilize: secp256r1. Without a precompile, verifying this signature onchain is extremely expensive. Adding support for RIP-7212 would decrease the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve [by 99%](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/what-is-rip-7212) when compared to current implementations. This makes implementing passkey-based wallets feasible for everyday use. Many wallets, and notably, apps using embedded wallets, have been requesting this feature for over a year.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community\u2019s mission and values as per the [Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values):\n\n- Ethereum-Aligned: RIP-7212 is the first Rollup Improvement Proposal adopted by the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The RIP stakeholders coordinate with Ethereum Core Devs to ensure Ethereum will continue to be compatible with the upgrade.\n\n- Accessibility: Many users who are not crypto-native will refuse to write down a seed phrase or buy a dedicated hardware wallet. While options exist to get around those pain points, this upgrade empowers account abstraction wallets to provide high-level security without UX tradeoffs.\n\n- Secure: Passkeys and secure enclaves offer hardware-level security since a user\u2019s private key can never leave the device. This is a great alternative to EOAs that does not compromise on usability.\n\n- Inclusivity: RIP-7212 was discussed publicly among all major L2s before being adopted. The codebase is open-source, and anyone can implement the upgrade.\n\n## Key Terms\n- RIP (Rollup Improvement Proposal): A process to establish optional norms and standards for L2s to extend the EVM and related tooling while limiting conflicts with the L1 EVM and preventing a proliferation of mutually incompatible standards among L2s.\n- Precompile: Predefined smart contracts with special addresses that provide specific functionality executed not at the EVM bytecode level but natively by the client.\n\n## Specification\nThe specifications of RIP-7212, including test cases, can be found in the [RIP repository](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md). If approved, Arbitrum One will use this specification as the reference for implementation.\n\nThe [Ethereum Magicians Forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7212-precompiled-for-secp256r1-curve-support/14789) discusses design decisions, iterations, and the transformation of the proposal from an EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) to a RIP.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:\n\n1. Discussion of the proposal on the forum and governance call(s)\n2. A vote on Snapshot to enable RIP-7212 on Arbitrum Sepolia\n3. Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet that emulates production environments\n4. An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova\n\n## Timeline\nThis proposal will be included in the vote to upgrade to the next version of ArbOS along with [Stylus](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts/22970), which will move to a Snapshot vote once it is production-ready.\n\nNOTE:\nIf this vote passes on Snapshot, the tentative plan is to upgrade Arbitrum Sepolia to ArbOS 30 the week of June 10th.\n\nIf Arbitrum Sepolia upgrades to ArbOS 30, there will be an ecosystem-wide plan to ensure non-breaking compatibility of infrastructure and applications with Stylus, which will take several weeks or months. The ultimate goal is that the experience for EVM developers remains as unchanged as possible if ArbOS reaches mainnet.

The proposal involves integrating Arbitrum One with the open-source Rarible Protocol, which is an indexer, order book, and SDK powering NFT-based applications, which, once integrated, can be freely and easily used by the Artbitrum builders.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is hard for independent developers to build NFT-based applications due to a lack of easy-to-use tooling and infrastructure. Without this support, the developer community will opt for other chains with more robust support for building.\n\nOptimism vs. Arbitrum NFT stats as of July 27, 2023, indicate Arbitrum is not the first choice for the creation of NFT assets or contracts.

Furthermore, the Protocol is used by [Rarible.com](https://rarible.com/) NFT marketplace, whose brand and community can be leveraged in raising awareness about Arbitrum venturing deeper into NFT tooling. Such signaling to the market will show that the Arbitrum community is serious about growing its ecosystem and flourishing NFTs. Rarible and the Rari Foundation will promote the integration in a cross-marketing push to ensure the NFT and crypto community knows that Arbitrum is serious about NFT growth. This support will consist of (and shall not be limited to):\n\n* Regular features on [Rarible.com](https://rarible.com/) 1 top spotlight section (1 million MAU)\n* Dedicated social support for the launch on Rarible\u2019s and Rari Foundation\u2019s owned channels (Twitter, Instagram, Discord, 800k+ followers combined)\n* Email blasts for the integration (500k+ subscribers)\n* Leveraging Rarible\u2019s and Rari Foundation\u2019s press relations\n* Potentially a hackathon\n\nThis proposal is being submitted outside of the pending grants framework in order to implement the integration asap, as waiting for the grants framework would result in significant implementation delays. As such, the Arbitrum DAO has an opportunity to express its willingness to incentivize ecosystem growth via strategic partnerships.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe proposed AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community\u2019s mission and guiding values by enhancing the utility, scalability, and inclusivity of the Arbitrum network. The Rarible Protocol, a decentralized toolset for NFT applications, is open-source and free, mirroring Arbitrum\u2019s commitment to technical inclusivity and neutrality.\n\nBy integrating Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol, we empower developers to create more complex and innovative applications on Arbitrum. This integration increases accessibility to real-time and historical Arbitrum blockchain data, aligning closely with Arbitrum\u2019s commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Rari Foundation: The legal entity for the Rari DAO community that is in possession of $RARI Treasury and on the path of possession of the Rarible Protocol\n\nRarible Inc.: A leading NFT marketplace that allows users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs. One of the applications using the Rarible Protocol.\n\nRarible Protocol: Open-source, free-to-use, community-governed Protocol (which includes an SDK, indexer, and order book) for the creation, transaction, and distribution of NFTs.\n\nRarible SDK: A part of the Rarible Protocol that provides a set of tools for developers to interact with multiple blockchains\n\nA few notes on the [Rarible Protocol](https://rarible.org/):\n* It is an open-source, EVM-based SDK and multichain indexer that currently powers 4,000+ NFT marketplaces (including [Rarible.com](https://rarible.org/), and a series of non-marketplace-based applications (like wallets and NFT analytics services - see more use cases [here](https://docs.rarible.org/use-cases/use-cases-overview/)).\n* Designed as a set of building blocks, the Rarible protocol empowers the creation of fully customized NFT experiences of any level and complexity. \ufe0f\n* API access is lightning-fast, unified, and comprehensive. You gain seamless access to NFT Items, Collections, Activities, and NFT Metadata across multiple blockchains, including ETH, POL, IMX, FLOW, and TEZ, to name a few \u2014all consolidated within a single endpoint.\n* The Protocol\u2019s indexer is the fastest on the market. It retrieves blockchain data through fast APIs, eliminating the need for your own indexer and reducing costs associated with maintaining Blockchain Nodes.\n* User-friendly SDK allows you to connect wallets seamlessly, mint NFTs, put them up for sale, purchase NFTs, showcase collections, and so much more. The Protocol is the feature-rich product on the market (you can do anything NFT related on our Protocol).\n* Comprehensive Marketplace Support: Our platform offers unrivaled support for various marketplaces, providing access to aggregated order books from major platforms like OS, LR, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and Tezos, so you can ensure your users have access to the most competitive listings in the market.\n* Cutting-Edge NFT API Integration: We pride ourselves on providing the best NFT API support, seamlessly integrating with popular communication tools such as Discord, Zendesk, VIP support, Slack, and TG.\n* Powerful Analytics Capabilities: Our platform boasts best-in-class analytics tools, including OLAP statistics and floor price analysis, empowering users with valuable insights into market trends and performance.\n* Unmatched Reliability: We maintain the highest level of reliability, ensuring a remarkable 99.99% uptime for our Protocol, making us the most dependable choice in the market.\n\n## Specifications\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of how the integration will take place and the platforms and technologies that will be used.\n\n### Rarible Protocol: Integrating Arbitrum One\nThe Rarible Protocol is a decentralized toolset that allows developers to build NFT applications. It includes smart contracts, an indexer, an SDK, and APIs. The integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol will extend these capabilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem, enhancing its utility and inclusivity.\n\n1. Rarible Arbitrum SDK\n - The Rarible SDK will expedite Arbitrum application development. By extending the SDK to support Arbitrum One, we will provide developers with tools for interacting with smart contracts, supporting NFT operations like minting, transferring, and burning, and integrating with multiple wallets.\n2. Rarible Orderbook & Smart Contracts\n - Our contracts, specifically the Rarible Exchange V2, will be deployed to the Arbitrum chain, granting access to our off-chain order book. Certain actions, such as canceling, confirming, updating, or when price changes occur, are on-chain, but orders are created off-chain.\n3. Rarible Public API\n - With the integration of Arbitrum One, the API will offer extended support for these chains, allowing developers to easily access and interact with NFT data on Arbitrum.\n4. Rarible Arbitrum Indexer\n - Rarible\u2019s multichain indexer will be able to track and record NFT events on Arbitrum, providing developers with a comprehensive view of NFT activities on Arbitrum.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n### Arbitrum One integration into Rarible Protocol\n\nThe first key milestone will be integrating Arbitrum into the Rarible Protocol, which will set the foundation for future milestones involving building NFT applications on Arbitrum.\n\nTasks: Integration of Arbitrum One chain into Rarible Protocol\n\n* Arbitrum API Integration: This task involves integrating the Arbitrum API into the Rarible Protocol API to support Arbitrum One.\n* Node Preparation: A separate node for Arbitrum will be set up for rapid indexing upon approval\n* Contract Deployment: The Rarible Shared NFT, Rarible Factory (for creating collections), and Rarible ExchangeV2 contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum for users to interact with.\n* Orderbook: Rarible\u2019s order book will be able to store listings, orders, and bids made with the Protocol\n* Arbitrum Indexer: Index NFT contracts, ERC-721/1155, ERC-20 tokens, Exchange orders & bids (from Seaport & Rarible).\n* Arbitrum support on Rarible Multichain SDK: This involves adding a new blockchain, connectors to wallets, and ensuring functionality similar to ETH/Polygon.\n* Debugging and Testing: General debugging of all components will be conducted, along with testing on production with OpenSea orders.\n* Build Testnet for Arbitrum: An additional environment for the testnet will be set up, including indexing, reindexing, etc.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe tentative timeline consists of 7 weeks, 5 of which are the integration phase. If the proposal is approved by early September 2023, the project implementation can be executed in early Q4 2023.\n\n![f2c50222937695d8622cbfc5429a99a48c1efaab_2_1380x274.png](ipfs://bafkreidspk3ghv2f32w5jfvtidmypu32j4pmzyf4lius3zl2nflisd2xsm)\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nAs the integration of the Rarible Protocol and Arbitrum will benefit both ecosystems, we are offering to split the Rarible Protocol integration costs between our two parties with an equal share.\n\nIntegration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol\n\nDuration: 5 Weeks\n\nCosts: 200,000 $ (Artibtrum portion = 100,000 $)\n\nPayment terms:\n* 50% payable upon proposal approval\n* 50% payable upon completion\n\nThe amount is payable in USDC or ETH.\n\nNote that the Rari Foundation will absorb costs related to the service and maintenance of the Protocol upkeep after the integration implementation.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "737d13b4-1aa7-4801-87aa-ff8ecd569181", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x0009d48b523e97787c5e49ae74b2c7f8516cf7bbc66489d9ddabced7a98b3bad", "title": "Alchemix LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0xAD16ebE6FfC7d96624A380F394cD64395B0C6144", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x0009d48b523e97787c5e49ae74b2c7f8516cf7bbc66489d9ddabced7a98b3bad", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [98121404.0193218, 38754133.746842794, 544025.073209031], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.678", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/alchemix-ltipp-application-draft/21395\n\n## Council -  3/5 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nAlchemix presented a strong application scored well due to their prior history on Ethereum mainnet and thorough application. Their incentive design causes some concern due to how they plan to melt the ARB as repayment for the end-users loan. While we are normally against directly selling the ARB incentives as part of LTIPP, we believe in this case it is justified with how their users interact with their product. Overall, Alchemix justified their grant ask and provided a thorough execution strategy and fair success metrics. We will be supporting this application.\n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe project has been in the space for a long time and has seen significant growth. However, there is a lack of details on how the project has performed on Arbitrum. The numbers mentioned regarding the size of the grant are conservative, and we doubt whether the protocol would be able to maintain liquidity post-incentives. The purpose of this grant is to bootstrap the AL (alchemist) ecosystem. While the overall grant is not large, which is a positive, I am unsure about the lasting impact of temporary boosts to the AL (assets). The protocol has been live on multiple chains, creating a significant impact in the DeFi ecosystem. The KPIs and milestones also seem quite low. For example, Milestone 3 aims for 50 addresses with open positions two-thirds of the way into grant distribution, and Milestone 4 targets 100 addresses with open positions at completion of grant distribution. This doesn\u2019t demonstrate a wide enough impact to enhance the ecosystem. Unfortunately we won't be supporting the proposal.  \n\n\n*GFX Feedback*\nThis was a reasonably sized grant request for a protocol established on Ethereum and newly launching on Arbitrum. The grant plan was straightforward in goals and execution plan. Only major improvement we would have suggested would be a marketing element to Alchemix\u2019s established Ethereum user base to come try the product on Arbitrum as well. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote AGAINST Alchemix's proposal.\n\nGood proposal that scored well across the rubric criteria that has been able to show resilience on ETH L1 throughout the bear keeping in mind exploits and other events that affected the protocol. The requested grant size is not crazy with sufficient justification and matching, however unable to endorse for the following reasons: (i) inconsistencies in target TVL (5M vs. 20M; presumably from the reduction in grant size); (ii) more detail behind stickiness and the migration strategy to drive L1 TVL into Arbitrum (difficult to form a reference and see if milestones are obtainable); (iii) would like to see greater adoption on Arbitrum first to showcase initial Arbitrum market demand; (iv) would have liked to see all milestones mapped against the KPIs with more robustness (against TVL and users).\n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\n\nAlchemix\u2019s application was very solid with thorough justifications of their requested grant size, KPIs, milestones, and goals. The product itself is unique infrastructure that Arbitrum can benefit from and has proven demand. Furthermore, the team has shown their ability to work with previous incentive programs, manage their own incentives, and focus on building out protocol relationships.\nWe will be supporting this application.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "75e17e2b-6ac3-4971-ad70-22896bfbc5e5", "proposal_id": "872c8091-a086-4949-b21f-17bae80d5918", "snapshot_id": "0x3d5ffb8e23b5f22f495f6460ef5ee8771efe5da5565dfa011917a78a2ec25916", "title": "Arbitrum Multi-sig Support Service (MSS)", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3d5ffb8e23b5f22f495f6460ef5ee8771efe5da5565dfa011917a78a2ec25916", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-05-21 22:27:25", "voting_end": "2024-05-28 22:27:25", "options": {"scores": [157074725.13573772, 659210.1655790453, 78594.47292284518, 41233.22976325471], "choices": ["FOR: Implement MSS and Reporting", "FOR: Implement MSS", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-05-28 22:27:25", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.212", "body": "Please view the full proposal text on the forum: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss/23737\n\n#### Non-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\nWe propose creating a structured multi-sig framework to facilitate funded programs within Arbitrum DAO to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency. \n\nAs of April 2024, the DAO administers six programs with a designated budget for multi-sig signing. The aggregate budgeted cost across these programs for signers stands at 158,000 ARB, with an annualized total expenditure, based on estimations, of 470,000 ARB or $627,840 at an ARB price of $1.34. This is a high cost for the DAO to pay on a purely operational function, especially **considering that these operational costs will likely rise as more programs are funded.** \n\nWe propose creating a \u201cMulti-sig Support Service\u201d (MSS) to unlock significant cost-saving opportunities, lessen committee fragmentation, ensure signers are competent with multi-sigs, and reduce friction for contributors creating proposals. The MSS will comprise 12 elected individuals to all DAO-funded multi-sigs. They will be compensated a base USD amount, paid in ARB, for performing these services across the DAO. \n\nThis proposal also includes the optional steps to fund the implementation of r3gen monthly Token Flow reporting on inflows (revenue) and outflows (spend) across the DAO as well as providing detailed information and analysis on spending from MSS multisigs. Together, this proposal will help create a \u201cbackroom finance\u201d function within the DAO that can be used across different initiatives. \n\nThe proposed changes offer the potential to generate substantial cost savings, estimated to be ~$315,000 per annum, while increasing efficiency, transparency, and security of DAO spending.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Arbitrum DAO oversees six programs which pay multi-sig signers. Each multi-sig typically has five signers, except for the STIP and STIP backfund programs, which share the same multi-sig and have nine signers budgeted for. \n\nThe full analysis detailed in the forum post underscores the operational unsustainability of the current expenditure level, with an annualised cost totalling $627,840 USD based on the average ARB price of $1.34 between August 7, 2023 and April 30, 2024, the period starting when Arbitrum DAO\u2019s first multisig was funded.\n\nThe cost per transaction appears excessive when comparing these figures against the volume of unique transactions sent from each multi-sig. While analysis for all multi-sig wallets is included for completeness, the STIP/Backfund multi-sig provides the clearest picture of the \u201ccost per transaction\u201d due to its proximity to completion.\n\nThis analysis highlights the urgent need for restructuring and cost optimization within the Arbitrum DAO to ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency in the long term.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that the current structure has individuals appearing across multiple different multi-sigs, drawing income from each.\n\nCurrently, the DAO experiences a significant dispersion in its structure, where each funded program operates its own multi-sig. This fragmentation not only leads to redundancy but also elevates the overall cost of operations. Through the \u201cMulti-sig Support Service\u201d (MSS), we can eliminate these inefficiencies and significantly reduce unnecessary expenditure.\n\nAdditionally, individuals on multi-sigs are generally not elected, posing a challenge in consistently ensuring that only the most trusted and competent members manage these critical roles. By shifting to an elected model within the MSS, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and professionalism, ensuring that every signer meets a high standard of trust and competency.\n\nFinally, contributors currently face friction in advancing proposals due to the need to wrangle signers, which can delay or deter the proposal process. The MSS aims to streamline this process by providing a reliable and consistent team of signers to be included in proposals, thereby reducing the time and effort of contributors, and accelerating the pace at which the DAO can execute its initiatives.\n\nBy creating a structured multisig committee, process, and reporting cadence around spending, the DAO will be better equipped to service its plethora of proposals that require payments and maintain transparency around the programs.\n\n## Proposed solution\nThe proposed framework for the Arbitrum DAO aims to address these issues by:\n\n1. Arbitrum DAO elects 12 signers via Snapshot weighted voting, shielded with Shutter\n      * Signers, when submitting their application to join the MSS, may opt in to be an MSS Chair, who will be responsible for communicating to the DAO on the MSS\u2019s behalf. The three opted-in signers with the highest weight according to Snapshot will be allocated MSS Chairs.\n2. For each new DAO initiative requiring a multisig, a new 12 signer multisig is set up.\n     * The signing threshold will be dependent on the total dollar denominated value of the wallet\n          i. 6/12: <$1M\n          ii. 7/12: $1M-$5M\n          iii. 8/12: $5M-$10m\n          iiii. 9/12 $10M-$50M\n3. Signers are paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB using spot price at the time of payment. The MSS Chairs will be paid $2500 per month in ARB using the spot price.\n     * We feel denominating the payment in a $ value is important to ensure the DAO pays a fair price for service rendered without the risk of ARB price movement leading to a series of overpayment or underpayment to signers for their duty. \n4. This will be paid out monthly from the MSS multi-sig, which will be a 6/12 including the entirety of the MSS.\n     * Payment for multisig signers will only start once the first new multisig is onboarded under the Multisig Support Service MSS structure.\n     * Existing multi-sigs have the option to \u201copt in\u201d to the MSS structure. If they do so any existing ring-fenced budget for multisig signing should be sent directly to a new MSS multisig. An MSS Chair will coordinate with the Program to manage the transition process. We expect a gradual turnover given the incentives at play and that most multi-sigs will not opt into the transition process. \n5. The same process is repeated to onboard new MSS members 12 months after the first is complete (starting the process 4 months before the term is up to allow for ample time)\n\nWe suggest the program is capped at initiatives seeking funding of $50M or less. This will help ensure that the program is not bottlenecked by one single initiative.

They also offer advanced tools for large-scale monitoring and analytics to empower data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nAs Research Members, our primary goal is to strengthen Arbitrum\u2019s position as the leading Layer 2 solution. For any network, the core requirements are a strong developer mindshare and capture, projects that address both emerging and institutional use cases, and deep liquidity across the ecosystem. To address these challenges, we propose the following research initiatives for the first two months.\n\n\n### **1. Expanding Arbitrum\u2019s Ecosystem: A Strategic Analysis of Emerging Untapped Sectors and Institutional Opportunities**\n\n\n\n* Arbitrum has long been a hub for DeFi protocols, and this will continue. However, with the emergence of new market cycles and innovative primitives, it\u2019s crucial to understand and expand into these new areas, both crypto-native and institutional.\n* For example, Polymarket, a prediction market app, accounted for nearly half of Polygon\u2019s transaction volume in October 2024. As new primitives emerge, Arbitrum must capture protocols from these sectors.\n* This research aims to assess where Arbitrum lags behind competing Layer 2 and Layer 1 networks. The study will explore:\n    1. Crypto-native sectors: prediction markets, memecoins, decentralized science (DeSci), gaming, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), etc.\n    2. Institutional sectors: Treasuries, payments, funds, and bonds\n* We will conduct a data-driven analysis to identify key sectors with little to no presence on Arbitrum, evaluate their growth potential, and develop strategies to attract these protocols to the network.\n\n    Final Outcome: A comprehensive report identifying high-potential crypto-native and institutional sectors currently underrepresented on Arbitrum to develop targeted strategies for attracting protocols and expanding network dominance beyond DeFi.\n\n\n\n### **2. Catalyzing Capital Migration from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum: A Strategic Framework for Liquidity Attraction**\n\nEthereum Mainnet currently has more than $60B of Capital sitting on it. Currently, Arbitrum is leading in terms of attracting these outflows from the Ethereum main net, but with more L1s and L2s coming in it\u2019s necessary to constantly research and strategise on how Arbitrum can be the home for this liquidity.\n\nOur main aim with this research is to analyse the patterns of large capital holders and their migration patterns from the mainnet and interview them to find out any gaps in terms of security, infrastructure, and opportunities.\n\n\n\n* Recent advancements \u2014 such as live fraud proofs, enhanced cross-chain infrastructure, and an increasing number of protocols building on Arbitrum\u2014make it the ideal platform for this migration.\n* This research will:\n    * Analyse the risk profiles of large capital holders\n    * Assess the current infrastructure for migration and identify gaps\n    * Engage with capital holders through interviews to develop a strategy for attracting liquidity\n* Key areas of focus will include:\n    * Identifying infrastructural gaps that hinder capital migration\n    * Conducting user interviews to understand views on Layer 2 migration\n    * Analysing capital ownership on the mainnet and categorising entities by likelihood of migration\n    * Exploring short-term strategies and incentives to encourage both migration and long-term retention of liquidity on Arbitrum\n\n    Final Outcome: Develop a comprehensive strategy to facilitate and incentivize the migration of $50 billion in capital from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum by addressing security concerns, infrastructure gaps, and stakeholder needs.\n\n\n\n### **3. Diversifying Arbitrum\u2019s Network Revenue Streams: Beyond Sequencer Fees**\n\nThis research initiative aims to address the critical challenge of developing sustainable revenue streams for the Arbitrum network, acknowledging that the current reliance on sequencer fees is not sufficient for long-term sustainability. The study will conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential revenue models, examining both traditional blockchain monetization strategies and innovative approaches unique to Arbitrum\u2019s architecture.\n\n**Research Methodology (Overview)**:\n\n\n\n* Analyze successful revenue models from other blockchain networks.\n* Evaluate emerging trends in network monetization.\n* Assess the feasibility of implementing various revenue streams within Arbitrum\u2019s existing framework.\n\n    Final Outcome: A report with supporting data/dashboards to identify and evaluate innovative, sustainable revenue models beyond sequencer fees to ensure Arbitrum\u2019s long-term financial stability and present actionable implementation strategies to the DAO\n\n\n\n### **4. Developer Experience in the Arbitrum Ecosystem: A Comprehensive Analysis of Tooling, Support, and Cross-Chain Infrastructure**\n\n\n\n* The Arbitrum Orbit cluster is rapidly expanding, with over 50 Layer 2 and Layer 3 projects currently being built, making it one of the largest chain clusters today. Arbitrum has also launched its multi-VM smart contract framework, Arbitrum Stylus.\n* As the Orbit cluster grows and Stylus is in place, it\u2019s important to identify infrastructure bottlenecks and challenges developers face.\n* This research will involve interviews with both existing and new builders to:\n    1. Assess the current state of developer tooling on Arbitrum\n    2. Identify support needed from Orbit chain teams for continued growth\n    3. Explore challenges around intra-chain and cross-chain messaging within the Orbit ecosystem\n\n    Final Outcome: An actionable framework to enhance Arbitrum\u2019s developer ecosystem by evaluating current tooling infrastructure, support systems, and competitive positioning through extensive developer interviews and comparative analysis with peer networks.\n\n\n\n# **The Block Research**\n\n**Name of Applicant & Applicant\u2019s Representative (If applicable):** The Block Research Team, represented by Abraham Eid, Alice Hou\n\n**Telegram Handle (if applicable)**: @Abraham_0000, @alice_hou\n\n**LinkedIn Profile (if applicable)**: Abraham Eid, Alice Hou\n\n**The role being applied for (choose one):** Research Working Member\n\n**Hourly Rate (in USDC):** 500 (for the whole 5-member team)\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nThe Block boasts over 5 years of experience, backed by a team of more than 35 research specialists. They have serviced over 135 clients across Web3, FinTech, VC, and traditional finance sectors, including conducting research for leading ecosystems such as Arbitrum, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and Avalanche.\n\nNotable projects led by Block Research include guiding a $2B+ public gaming firm on its Web3 gaming market entry strategy, collaborating with billion-dollar blockchain platforms on competitive benchmarking and development strategies, informing token distribution strategies for prominent Layer 2 protocols, and co-developing institutional-grade crypto index products for top-tier funds requiring resilience in volatile markets.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nArbitrumDAO stands at a point where refining its governance frameworks and improving its ability to measure community engagement can drive meaningful progress. Our proposed work in the first two months of the six-month term will focus on two key initiatives: exploring complementary governance models and developing a comprehensive community metrics dashboard to evaluate the social adoption of Arbitrum\u2019s various product offerings. These initiatives address the DAO\u2019s current challenges, combining structured research and data tools to support transparency, efficiency, and community engagement.\n\n\n### **Complementary Governance Models**\n\nThe need for scalable and effective governance is clear from past initiatives like the Gaming Catalyst Program, where issues such as lagged operations and limited measurable impact surfaced. To address these challenges, we propose researching, designing, and piloting governance models such as futarchy and quadratic funding.\n\n\n\n* Futarchy: This approach uses prediction markets to align governance decisions with measurable outcomes, ensuring that proposals are evaluated based on their projected success. We will conduct simulations to model how this approach could guide decision-making by analyzing hypothetical scenarios.\n* Quadratic Funding: This model supports fair resource distribution by emphasizing broad participation in grant programs and community initiatives. Our analysis will optimize funding allocations by examining voting behaviors, incentives, and projected impacts.\n\nIn designing these frameworks, we will deliver data-driven insights, including sensitivity analyses to explore how different variables (e.g., voter turnout, proposal costs) influence their effectiveness. Our work will culminate in a detailed proposal for governance experiments tailored to ArbitrumDAO, providing stakeholders with actionable tools to address governance challenges.\n\n\n### **Community Metrics Dashboard**\n\nA vibrant and engaged community is critical for the success of any ecosystem. Developers often assess the community dynamics of an ecosystem when deciding if to build. Similarly, investors and users look for signals that indicate the ecosystem\u2019s health and momentum. However, existing metrics like Twitter & Discord follower counts fall short of capturing the nuanced sentiment and engagement within a community.\n\nWe propose developing a community metrics dashboard that aggregates a wide range of indicators to provide a comprehensive view of ecosystem activity. This framework will allow developers, investors, and users to \u201ctest the temperature\u201d of the ecosystem with data-driven insights. The dashboard would track, but not be limited to:\n\n\n\n* Social Media Metrics: Twitter impressions, engagement rates, and Google Trends data to gauge interest and visibility.\n* Sentiment Analysis: Aggregating community opinions from forums, tweets, and developer discussions to understand emotional and social trends.\n* Engagement Metrics: Measuring active participation in Discord, Telegram, and GitHub to assess the vibrancy of the ecosystem.\n\nThis dashboard will not only help developers evaluate which technical stack to build on, but also assist investors in identifying promising projects, and users in understanding the ecosystem\u2019s momentum. The ultimate goal is to establish a robust framework for assessing community sentiment and engagement that can set a new standard for the industry.\n\nThrough these efforts, we aim to provide ArbitrumDAO with structured governance models and a scalable framework for measuring community engagement. Together, these initiatives will help the DAO address its immediate challenges while laying the groundwork for sustained growth and ecosystem vitality.\n\n\n# **Llama Research & Castle Capital ([@dl_research](https://x.com/@dl_research) & [@castle__cap](https://x.com/@castle__cap))**\n\n**Name of Applicant & Applicant\u2019s Representative**: DefiLlama Research & Castle Capital\n\n**Email Address**: ryan@dlnews.com, atomist@castlecapital.vc (please contact both)\n\n**Telegram Handle**: [@cryptodurs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cryptodurs) and [@atomist](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/atomist)\n\n**Role**: Research Working Member\n\n**Hourly Rate (in USDC)**: $100 per hour\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nDefiLlama Research and Castle Capital bring complementary expertise to the table.

On the other hand, Castle Capital adds deep experience in shaping Arbitrum\u2019s governance and incentive frameworks, having contributed to initiatives like LTIPP and STIP Bridge, while creating accessible dashboards and educational content in collaboration with over 60 protocols.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nThe proposed scope of work will tackle the challenges the Arbitrum DAO faces, providing data-driven insights that can be leveraged to accelerate each component of Arbitrum\u2019s flywheel (outside of the technology stack). [Unifying Arbitrum\u2019s Mission, Vision, Purpose (MVP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-s-mission-vision-purpose-mvp/27275/1).\n\n\n### **1. Exploratory Research on Builder Retention & Expansion (Target = Applications)**\n\nProblem: Builders are not always aware of opportunities within the ecosystem or the possibilities that the tech stack unlocks, and once onboarded have limited support from the DAO.\n\nGoal: Identify and address key challenges in developer retention, ecosystem growth, and strategic alignment to recommend an effective builder expansion strategy.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* Builder Needs Survey & Interviews: Identify pain points of current developers on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n* Developer Segmentation: Profile builders (DeFi, GameFi, infrastructure) for tailored support.\n* Competitive Benchmarking: Assess gaps vs. other layer 2 networks.\n* Strategic Recommendations: Propose clear steps to improve onboarding and incentives.\n\nPost Work Unlock: A clear pathway for an onboarding/ecosystem workstream to be set-up with a clear basis for a strategy to be created and implemented.\n\n\n### **2. Ecosystem-Building Initiatives (Target = DAO-Driven Development Programs)**\n\nProblem: Arbitrum lacks a competitive strategy to reward innovation, limiting its ability to attract and retain top-tier developers critical to its reputation as a home for disruptive builders.\n\nGoal: Position Arbitrum as the premier blockchain for innovation by optimizing grant funding and incentivizing novel protocols.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* RPGF Analysis: Evaluate the impact of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) models in competing ecosystems.\n* Innovation Grants: Propose funding mechanisms to reward long-term, high-impact projects.\n* Grant Prioritization: Identify top Arbitrum-aligned protocols for strategic funding.\n* Builder Engagement: Suggest strategies to strengthen relationships with existing projects.\n\nPost-Work Unlock: A roadmap for a grant-driven growth workstream to attract top builders and drive sustainable ecosystem expansion.\n\n\n### **3. Improving Orbit Chain Experience & Ecosystem Integration (Target = Ecosystem)**\n\nProblem: Orbit chains often feel disconnected from Arbitrum One and other orbits, with fragmented liquidity and suboptimal UX. While full interoperability relies on Offchain Labs, abstracting chain complexities can drive immediate improvements and enhance ecosystem cohesion.\n\nGoal: Address UX gaps, simplify chain abstraction, and align Orbit chains with the broader ecosystem while exploring future technical solutions as they mature.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* Non-Technical UX Solutions: Propose immediate improvements to UX, including chain abstraction to streamline user interactions and reduce complexity.\n* Bridge Design Analysis: Compare intent-based bridges across ecosystems and suggest best practices for Arbitrum.\n* Messaging Layer Review: Evaluate existing messaging layer solutions for Orbit chains, focusing on user-centric abstraction of chain communication.\n* Alignment with Ethereum Plans: Analyse how proposed solutions align with Ethereum\u2019s interoperability and chain abstraction strategies.\n\nPost-Work Unlock: Clear recommendations for improving UX and advancing Orbit chain adoption while leveraging chain abstraction for seamless user experiences.\n\nWe also plan to include the following projects in our Scope of Work, which are detailed in \u2018Additional Details\u2019 on the forum (i) Arbitrum\u2019s Search for its Identity (ii) New Sector Mapping and Outreach.\n\n\n# **Blockworks Advisory**\n\n\n\n* Name of Applicant & Applicant\u2019s Representative [If Applicable]:\n    * Blockworks Advisory\n        * Representatives: [EffortCapital](https://x.com/EffortCapital), [magicdhz](https://x.com/magicdhz), [GoldDefi](https://x.com/GoldDefi), [0xMims](https://x.com/0xMims)\n* Email Address:\n    * Blockworks Advisory: advisory@blockworks.co\n* Telegram Handle (if applicable):\n    * Blockworks Advisory representatives:\n        * @effortcapital, @magicdhz, @carolinagold, @Mims0x, @rmalakaib\n* Role being applied for: Research-Oriented Member\n* Hourly Rate (in USDC): $195/hr per individual\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nBlockworks has established itself as a premier source of deep technical and protocol-specific research over the past two and a half years. During its participation in ARDC V1, Blockworks played a pivotal role in recovering/saving over 3.7M ARB in misused or unallocated funds for the DAO and Foundation (e.g. Furucombo and Synapse) while also facilitating important discussions around Timeboost.\n\nAdditionally, they developed a comprehensive Arbitrum data dashboard, delivering valuable insights into the platform's on-chain activity and financial metrics. They also support other leading protocols such as the Solana Foundation, Lido, and Ethena among others.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\n\n### **1. Unified Incentives Framework (Incentive Program Design Assistance)**\n\nThrough our initial ARDC STIP work, Blockworks Advisory is uniquely positioned to assist in the development of the next incentive program scheduled to launch in 2025. Blockworks Advisory could work closely with the Incentives Working Group and other major stakeholders to create a Unified Incentives Framework that applies previous best practices and lessons learned to optimize ROI in various objective functions. While we will not administer the incentives or perform the operations (management, etc) we will help structure the proposal, and the program for the greater good of the ecosystem leveraging research accomplished. As the embargo on incentives ends in Q1, this would likely be our first deliverable, and would span 2 months worth of time in our term. Additionally, we believe this deliverable to be of great value to the DAO, given the DAOs past initiatives, STIP and LTIP, and the likely continuance of incentives post-embargo. The Foundation has also weighed in and has provided incentives as a suggested area of work for the Research member, found here - [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686).\n\nBelow are other deliverables that we can work on in addition to or besides the Incentive Framework.\n\n\n### **2. Timeboost Revenue Allocation Framework**\n\nWhile Timeboost is an innovative solution coming to Arbitrum that will likely be a positive catalyst for DAO revenue, there hasn\u2019t been a community-wide discussion on how the revenue should be allocated and whether it makes sense for the DAO to capture all proceeds or redistribute it to impacted LPs/protocols.\n\n\n### **3. Orbit Chain Strategy**\n\nProvide the DAO with a path towards aligning the ARB token with the growth of the Orbit tech stack, taking lessons learned from other ecosystems (Cosmos, Polkadot, Optimism, zkSync, etc). Outlining a procurement vs ownership model where we identify what products/services the DAO should own (e.g RaaS, block explorer, data indexing, etc).\n\n\n### **4. General Data Services**\n\nSimilar to the [Multisig Support Service](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss/23737) proposed by Entropy Advisors and R3gen Finance to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency, Blockworks Advisory could become a shared data service provider that any Arbitrum working group or initiative (including the Foundation) could tap into to fulfill all data needs. We have the most [comprehensive](https://x.com/blockworksres/status/1853879698029527453) Arbitrum data in the industry, including DAO financials, and can leverage this to empower the various stakeholders in the community.\n\n\n### **5. Developer-centric Strategy Framework**\n\nIn last year\u2019s [Developer Report from Electric Capital](https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report), Arbitrum saw a troubling decline in active developers in the ecosystem. This deliverable would be outlining the developer pipeline specifically in regards to Arbitrum, and provide suggestions for where DAO funding could possibly aid in the development process.\n\n\n### **6. Financial Audit of Arbitrum Grants Programs**\n\nThe Arbitrum Grants program is expansive, and a financial audit would simply be a retroactive analysis of the Arbitrum Grants program to date to determine ROI for the ecosystem.\n\n\n# **Messari**\n\n\n\n* Name of Applicant & Applicant\u2019s Representative (If applicable): Messari Protocol Services\n* Telegram Handle (if applicable): @ jackpurdy @ alex_barry22\n* LinkedIn Profile (if applicable): [Messari | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/messari/)\n* The role being applied for (choose one): Research Working Member\n* Hourly Rate (in USDC): $145/hour\n\nOur blended hourly rate of $145 reflects the expertise and resources required to deliver exceptional research and insights for the ArbitrumDAO.

Additionally, these changes will be fully funded within AGV\u2019s existing operating budget and require no additional DAO funds\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe startup responsibilities required to transform AGV from a concept into a functioning business entity were not envisaged at all in the original Tally proposal. During AGV\u2019s launch, Council members undertook a heavier, more hands-on workload than was scoped or anticipated. This extra work undertaken during AGV\u2019s startup phase was essential to successfully turn the original GCP Proposal into a functioning VC.\n\nThese startup-phase efforts, which were essential to successfully turn the original GCP Proposal into a functioning VC, are listed and expanded on in detail below:\n\n**Table B: AGV Startup Phase: Scoped vs Actual Council Workload**\n\n| **Category** | **Original Scope (4 hrs/week)** | **Startup Phase Scope (~10 hrs/week)** | **Notes / Impact** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Risk Mitigation & Investment Thesis** | Advise on initial investment thesis and portfolio approach | Contributed to initial portfolio strategy design, including risk policies and compliance checks | Front-loaded work to ensure robust oversight scaffolding and 0-1 strategic direction |\n| **Team Oversight & Nominations** | Provide oversight and input on GCP team members and performance | Direct involvement in early hiring of core partners; provided input on org design | Higher time intensity due to recruitment, headcount planning, and onboarding of initial team members |\n| **DAO Liaison** | Serve as liaison and oversight committee between DAO and GCP initiative | Engaged in foundational DAO communications, collaboration with Arbitrum Foundation, legal, ensuring transparency during setup | Higher oversight/responsibilities, frequency of updates needed at launch |\n| **Compliance & Governance** | Complete NDAs, KYC, disclose conflicts; uphold Arbitrum Constitution | Helped shape governance documents (bylaws, entity setup), ensuring legal/structural alignment with DAO goals | Expanded scope vs. original role |\n\nThe AGV team fully supports fair recognition of the Council\u2019s critical role during the program\u2019s inception. The proposed startup-phase bonus specifically acknowledges the extraordinary, front-loaded effort involved in designing AGV\u2019s foundational systems and launching its operations. This one-time award is separate from the forward-looking, market-benchmark adjustment and reflects the Council\u2019s instrumental work in positioning the program for scale.\n\n## Process, Implementation & Next Steps\n\nThe AGV team, in carrying out its responsibilities under the [Foundation Bylaws](https://arbitrumgamingventures.com/governance) to manage general and administrative matters of the GCP Program, including finance and human resources, prepared this proposal using industry and compensation benchmarks, as well as a comparison of the Council\u2019s originally laid out scope, and the additional startup phase scope that was required of them, along with its impact. The proposal was presented to the Council, which provided key input but recused itself from the decision-making process to avoid any conflict of interest. The Foundation Director has reviewed and approved the proposal in its current form.\n\nIn order to seek tokenholder approval on financial discrepancies between the original GCP Proposal and this proposal, the AGV team and Council now submit this proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n**If the proposal passes:**\n\n- The\u00a0**startup-phase bonus**\u00a0will be distributed to each current AGV Council member promptly after the vote concludes.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n- The master proposal was [resubmitted to the forum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-agv-council-compensation-calibration-benchmark-for-next-term-startup-phase-bonus/29424/12?u=arbitrumgaming) on 2nd October 2025.\n- The previous vote [scheduled on 9th October](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-agv-council-compensation-calibration-benchmark-for-next-term-startup-phase-bonus/29424/14?u=arbitrumgaming) was been [removed from Snapshot](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-agv-council-compensation-calibration-benchmark-for-next-term-startup-phase-bonus/29424/23?u=arbitrumgaming).\n- [**Proposal A (Benchmark Calibration for Future Council Members)**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth) was posted to Snapshot  on Thursday, 16th October and passed.\n- **Proposal B (Startup-Phase Bonus for Current Council Members)** will be posted to Snapshot voting on Thursday, 6th November (this proposal).\n\n### **Voting Options**\n\nThis proposal will include the following voting options:\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Abstain\n\nShould FOR be the majority preference, and the combined FOR and ABSTAIN votes meet at least 3% of the total votable ARB supply, the proposal will be considered approved and may proceed to implementation.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "78ec4e44-b604-4d8b-97ec-eaf8f3298700", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x991f18a73526fb5715b41e37f7460ced511c02cf3470d41cdaf97656c794406b", "title": "Election of STEP Program Manager", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x991f18a73526fb5715b41e37f7460ced511c02cf3470d41cdaf97656c794406b", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-06-05 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-06-12 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [5261730.139165584, 3555361.715352735, 94233938.17119232, 51729957.06999539], "choices": [" particula.io", "bluechip.org", "steakhouse.financial", "avantgarde.finance"]}, "last_activity": "2024-06-12 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.177", "body": "In April 2023, the Arbitrum DAO approved the diversification of 35 million ARB into stable, liquid and yield bearing assets. https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\n\nWe are now electing a program manager to oversee selected providers and take responsibility for the program.

These improvements are now audited and ready for adoption, including by Arbitrum Orbit chains, Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal concerns the latter two, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum's equivalent of a hardfork - more can be read about the subject over in https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695\n\n## Changes Included\n\n### 1. EVM Shanghai support (including the PUSH0 opcode)\n\nRecent versions of go-ethereum already includes support for the changes to the EVM made in the Shanghai L1 upgrade, but we need to enable them for Arbitrum chains. Instead of using a time based activation, it\u2019s better to activate support based on the ArbOS version, which makes sure that even if the upgrade is delayed, Shanghai support will take effect uniformly and without causing divergences with out of date node software.\n\nPRs: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1583 \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1664  \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1712\n\n### 2. Retryable fixes\n\nRetryable fees previously always used the network fee account, instead of also using the infrastructure fee account. The infrastructure fee account should be paid fees from the basefee, and the network fee account should be paid any surplus fees when the gas price is elevated. That was correctly implemented for normal transactions, but retryables only dealt with the network fee account. Retryable redemption also reported an incorrect gas usage in the block header. This matters to Arbitrum Nova, where the infrastructure fee account pays out some fees to the Data Availability Committee members, but the network fee account does not.\n\nPRs: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1789\nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1980\n\n### 3. Fix the chain owner list returned by precompile\n\nThis change doesn\u2019t affect the actual chain owner set, but the list being returned by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile was incorrect for Arbitrum Nova due to an internal ArbOS issue. To be clear, this does not affect who was able to make chain owner actions. As intended, only the DAO is able to make chain owner actions on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This change only affects the list of chain owners presented by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile.\n\nPRs: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1525\nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1768\n\n### 4. Fix some precompile methods taking up all gas when reverting\n\nSome precompile methods such as ArbSys\u2019s arbBlockHash method took up all gas when reverting. That meant that if a transaction called arbBlockHash with an out-of-range block number, it\u2019d use up all the gas when reverting.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1490\n\n### 5. Create missing precompile methods to view some L1 pricing parameters\n\nThe L1RewardReceipient and L1RewardRate were previously not exposed via precompiles. This change adds methods to get them to ArbGasInfo so that the current chain configuration can be easily checked.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1775\n\n### 6. Fix the possibility of a staticcall from the owner to ArbOwner emitting a log\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t matter in practice, but it was theoretically for a staticcall from the chain owner to the ArbOwner precompile to emit a log. In the EVM, staticcalls should never be able to emit logs. This PR fixes the Arbitrum precompile logic to disallow emitting logs in staticcall contexts.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1562\n\n### 7. Fix default L1 pricing params\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t matter for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, because these parameters were already corrected in [AIP-7](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-7-arbitrum-one-governance-parameter-fixes/15920). However, it\u2019s included in ArbOS version 11 so that any Arbitrum Orbit chains automatically get the correct parameters.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1549\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe canonical version of ArbOS 11 this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash  `df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d`\n\nThat commit builds a WASM module root of `0xf4389b835497a910d7ba3ebfb77aa93da985634f3c052de1290360635be40c4a`, which is a hash of the code that\u2019s put on-chain for fraud proofs. You can verify this WASM module root on a x86_64 computer (i.e. not on ARM which builds slightly different symbol names) with Docker setup by checking out the previously mentioned commit of the nitro repository, running `git submodule update --init --recursive`, and then running `docker build . --target module-root-calc --tag wavm-machine && docker run --rm wavm-machine cat /workspace/target/machines/latest/module-root.txt` This uses Docker to perform a reproducible build of the WebAssembly code used in fraud proofs, and outputs its hash.\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwA1PK3AB9ggHMqaw91mubu5WHcEp398/view?usp=sharing\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in \n\nhttps://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/170\n\nAction contract addresses:\n[SetArbOneArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe8e5dc1793d6fe39452ddcb90d12997fa39de1de#code)\n[SetNovaArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6B125347f3B0790197d5247f32f91fd3e7140eD7#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF6c7Dc6eaE78aBF2f32df899654ca425Dfa99481#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x5357f4d3e8f8250a77bcddd5e58886ad1358220c#code)\n\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N3197Z7DuqBpu9qdt-GWPewe8HQakfLY/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference\n\nThe current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 10, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v10` git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x6b94a7fc388fd8ef3def759297828dc311761e88d8179c7ee8d3887dc554f3c3`, which is what the rollup contract\u2019s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo audit the code difference from ArbOS 10 to ArbOS 11, you could simple generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn\u2019t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 10 or ArbOS 11 with bash:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\nmkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output\n# this script should be run in the nitro repository\ngit checkout df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '_test\\\\.go\n```\n\nNow, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 10 or 11. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\n```\ngit diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)\n```\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 10 and 11 used:\n\n```\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v10 go-ethereum                                                                                                                                                                                           128 \u21b5\n160000 commit 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298  go-ethereum\n$ git ls-tree df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d go-ethereum\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum\n```\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n```\ngit diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)\n```\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.10.25 and v1.11.6, as ArbOS 10 used the former and ArbOS 11 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 11\u2019s go-ethereum against ArbOS 10\u2019s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 11\u2019s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.11.6:\n\n```\ngit diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff\ngit diff v1.11.6 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff\n```\nIn addition, you can pass the following arguments to `diff-intersection.py` to ignore files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`\n\nNote that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "7b36defa-f064-42e3-999c-8e0abc10522e", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xd54c3dd8f27a9baef80c92189e63f06a6cb905e296be0b55dfaa8835a3b75127", "title": "Transparency and Standardized Metrics for Orbit Chains", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd54c3dd8f27a9baef80c92189e63f06a6cb905e296be0b55dfaa8835a3b75127", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-08-08 22:30:50", "voting_end": "2024-08-15 22:30:50", "options": {"scores": [55595270.90146707, 69566794.13998154, 30997767.515983768], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-08-15 22:30:50", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.09", "body": "Full title: [Non-Constitutional] Transparency and Standardized Metrics for Orbit Chains  on growthepie.xyz Allowing Data-Driven Decision Making\n\nPlease review the proposal forum post for a full proposal description: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084/1\n\n### Abstract\n\nWe want to increase the transparency into the Orbit stack by aggregating important metrics on a chain level so that users, builders, and DAO members can make better data-driven decisions, including what revenue an Orbit chain generates. This allows to plan much better, for example around an Orbit liquidity plan or other discussions around Orbit chains and their current/future support, or even retroactive programs (through better historic and comparable data points). \n\nThere is high likelyhood that the DAO will want to run an incentive program for Orbit Chains in the future. By having the data ready to go, we can avoid having a short-term program proposal which bootstraps data gathering. A 2% (low estimate) productivity increase on $50 million would have been $1 million. This proposal can likely pay for itself!\n\nIt will be in the form of a dedicated Arbitrum Orbit Stack page on [growthepie.xyz](http://growthepie.xyz/) having 20 chains listed with standardized metrics for each chain as well as an aggregated fundamental metrics view for the whole stack.\n\nBrief background: This proposal has been created initially for the Arbitrum GovHack Brussels and was selected as one of the finalists. This version is an updated version, especially making sure that this proposal is understood as \n-\ta start to have more usage analytics around Orbit chains\n-\tthat the future process of data collection and onboarding of chains is streamlined\n-\tconstantly iterated on to make the listings cheaper and more affordable/sustainable for upcoming (and potentially smaller, more niche) Orbit chains.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSo far, there is no go-to place that provides an overview of Arbitrum Orbit. Standardized metrics allow a better idea of the performance and outlook of each chain being part of the Arbitrum Orbit. This results in greater transparency for all chains regarding their activity and how the usage of one chain compares to another.\n\nUsers can use this information to gather a quick overview of the Orbit ecosystem. Builders can use the different metrics to better track adoption, and DAO members can make more data-driven decisions on future initiatives (e.g., Orbit retrospective funding based on onchain contribution to the DAO).\n\nAlso, visibility for the overall Arbitrum Orbit stack is increased, and the whole Ethereum ecosystem can see what is going on in the Arbitrum ecosystem - where to be and interact, build, or allocate funding towards. Additionally, for DAO members and delegates, revenue and cost metrics provide future insight into how the Orbit approach should be developed to make it profitable for the DAO as well (includes more transparency into how much Orbit chains are paying to Arbitrum One).\n\nThis proposal is meant as a start for a long-term partnership to provide listing of Orbit chains long-term and on a recurring basis on growthepie. After the listing of the first setup and 20 initial chains, we would like to follow up with another AIP to enable listing of the 21st+ chain.\n\n### Rationale\n\ngrowthepie is an entirely public goods funded analytics platform for Ethereum scaling solutions. The AIP aligns closely with Arbitrum community\u2019s mission and guiding values. At growthepie, Ethereum alignment is at the core of our existence, ensuring that our efforts contribute to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWe aim to enhance transparency, enabling data-driven decisions that are crucial for tracking outcomes and improving strategic decisions. All our code is open-source, allowing anyone to review and verify our metric logic. This openness fosters trust and ensures the integrity of our platform. We prioritize inclusivity by offering our platform and API completely free of charge, ensuring maximum accessibility for all users.\n\nOur user-focused design philosophy centers on the needs of our diverse audience, making data easy to digest and actionable for all users. We uphold the values of neutrality and openness as we believe in the power of data to increase transparency and objectivity. All information on our platform is freely available, reinforcing our commitment to these principles.\n\n### Specifications\n\ngrowthepie has proven to be a platform for people wanting to understand the overall health, activity, and usage across the Ethereum scaling solutions ecosystem. Arbitrum One was listed as one of the first 5 chains from the beginning. Since then, Arbitrum members have used the platform to compare Arbitrum One with other Layer 2s, and we have provided reliable data and visualizations for Arbitrum\u2019s community. Marketing has also used our charts to provide data-driven insights into the ecosystem and how Arbitrum One is growing, giving it more credibility.\n\nBuilding on this, the Arbitrum Orbit should be given a dedicated place on growthepie with 20 chains listed in the beginning. This allows us to provide a mostly complete overview of the whole Arbitrum stack. This proposal is aimed at the start of a longer partnership. Hence, as part of this proposal, we will design and set up the initial pages and backend needed to onboard Orbit chains, aggregate fundamental metrics, and especially revenue metrics for each chain.\n\n**Which Orbit chains will be considered among the 20 chains as part of this proposal?**\nEvery chain that is above $1 million TVL (Total Value Locked) at time of the listing decision, will be eligible to be listed as part of this proposal. Every chain that is below at the start of the listing process will not be considered. In case a chain falls below $1 million TVL in the future (after the listing decision had been made), the chain will stay on growthepie, however. The chain will not be delisted and available data will be presented as long as no official announcement by the chain's team has been made that the chain will be shut down. \n\nEach Orbit chain \u2013 as Arbitrum One and any other chain listed on growthepie \u2013 will have their own set of metrics (in the categories activity, value locked, economics, and convenience) and their own single chain page. Additionally, each chain will appear on each fundamental metrics page for which the specific metric is available.\n\n**Stack view for an aggregated Arbitrum Orbit view**\nOn top of that, we will introduce a Stack view (new page) that provides a complete overview of the whole stack aggregated. This will be on a dedicated page which will enable users, builders, and DAO members solely interested in the Orbit to go to this place and learn more. See the prototype which includes:\n\n* Leading chart that aggregates Layer 2s and/or Layer 3s together showing growth over time\n* Table that lists all available Orbit chains on growthepie separated into Layer 2 and Layer 3\n* Fundamental metrics section with the aggregated view of all chains combined in the Arbitrum Orbit\n\nThis set of views will make it possible to easily get an overview and see the growth of the whole Orbit ecosystem but also to compare certain Orbit chains against each other (or against other Layer 2s from other ecosystems).    \n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nTimeframe starting from the date of DAO proposal approval and weeks/months add up to each other. Total duration ~ 5 months. Chain listing time is also dependent on potential collaboration with an indexing provider and their speed of chain indexing.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-08-08 at 4.28.38 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigoncw5pkkpi3kyfevaiozgwiessp6hlfcf4ngdwnz6hqxryzmrdi)\n    \n\n### Overall Cost\n\nThe following cost are denominated in USD. The exact ARB amount will be determined closer to the onchain proposal date to reflect the US dollar ask. \n\n**Fix setup costs ($41,425.00 USD):**\n\n* Design and implement general platform UX adjustments (more chains mean restructuring of UI elements and different filter logic)\n* Designing and implementing frontend views: Orbit specific stack view, Single chain view (for each Orbit chain), Fundamentals view\n* Data infra setup (RPCs, database execution)\n* Metric aggregation & Logic: Activity (Transaction Count, Active Addresses \u2013 daily and monthly), Value locked (Stablecoin Market Cap, Total Value Locked), Economics (Revenue, Costs, Onchain Profit), plus Market Cap and Fully Diluted Valuation where applicable, Convenience metrics: Transaction Costs (median 1-day aggregation), DAO Contributions (how much back to ARB)\n\n**Initial chain listings (20 Orbit chains in total) and maintenance for 1 year ($168,750.00 USD):**\n\n* Integrate brand assets (icon, colors, etc.) for each chain\n* Pull raw transaction data and store in our database\n* Setup metric logic where applicable (e.g., bridge contracts for value locked, custom gas tokens, DA layer, settlement layer)\n* Daily aggregation of all relevant datapoints\n* Aggregated data / metrics available via API (for frontend and other data consumers)\n\n**Requirement:** Arbitrum Foundation provides indexed data. If not, an additional cost for indexing will be added ($3,750.00 USD per chain)\n\n**Recurring costs also cover:**\n\n* Hosting frontend\n* Maintenance backend / data pipelines\n* Regular posts on social media about interesting developments (from data perspective)\n\n**Total Costs: $210,175.00 USD**", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "7b9fc6dc-40f1-4327-90d9-948e7b523397", "proposal_id": "218a7ce5-c967-4397-8c4f-38f7eb17f3fb", "snapshot_id": "0xfd3551e2a0effc5d900e522b79300f68c351ec930cb05b62f537842508feceff", "title": "Proposal: Security Council Elections Proposed Implementation Spec", "author_name": "0x9808E45C613eBA00bA18fB3D314dC4d4712c4A85", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xfd3551e2a0effc5d900e522b79300f68c351ec930cb05b62f537842508feceff", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-08-08 16:01:38", "voting_end": "2023-08-15 16:01:38", "options": {"scores": [80668950.20360789, 178202.07603444194, 73082.77635965889], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-08-15 16:01:38", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.667", "body": "Category: Constitutional - Process\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n\nSection 3 of the Constitution 10 describes this council in more detail.\nInitial Setup Transparency Report 3 details the current members of the council.\nSection 4 on the Constitution outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\nExecutive summary\nThis vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\nA smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting.

Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to the specification laid out in the Constitution, is split into:\n\nElection stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\nUpdate stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\nElection Stages\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\nNominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\nCompliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\nMember election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\nUpdate Stages\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nSecurity Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\nL2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\nIndividual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\nSecurity Council Election Flow\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2bk2mmknletnshsvxbohkbszppbkb3wdntpnraj7x2gwgx2rgqq)\n    \nElection Stages in detail\n1. Nominee selection (7 days)\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration, candidate endorsement:\n\nElection creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\nCandidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\nEndorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\nFallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\nImplementation details\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n\nCustom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n\nA new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\nCandidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.\nDelegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n2. Compliance check by the Foundation(14 days)\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organisation being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\nImplementation details\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n\nCalling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n3. Member election (21 days)\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n\n0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n\nSplit voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\nImplementation details\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit from Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can trigger a new member election:\n\nCall the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n\nA custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\nThese additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\nThe custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\nUpdate stages in detail\n1. Security Council manager update\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n\nRemove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\nAdd a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\nAddress rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members as well as explicit approval from the member carrying out the rotation.\nImplementation details\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n2. Timelocks and withdrawal\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n\nL2 timelock (3 days),\nL2 \u2192 L1 withdrawal (~7 days),\nL1 timelock (3 days).\nYou can read more about these stages in the governance docs 1. The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\nImplementation details\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n3. Individual council updates\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis safes:\n\nArbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nArbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\nEthereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nNova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will replace them.\n\nImplementation details\nTo do this the existing Upgrade Executor contracts on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom Governance Action Contract 2 will be used to call the specific OwnerManager addOwnerWithThreshold and removeOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\nAdditional affordances\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\nThe DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favour and 5/6 of cast votes are in favour. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nConstitution Updates\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution\u2019s text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\nUpdate timeline for the election\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n\nFrom T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nFrom T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n\nAt T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n\nNew timeline. A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\nLess than 6 eligible nominees. The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\nInstallation time. We need to remove the phrase \u2018immediately join the Council\u2019 to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user\u2019s right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 \u2192 L1 message.\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the Constitution with the following text:\n\nNominee selection (T until T+7 days): Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n\nCompliance process (T+7 until T+21 days): All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nMember election (T+21 until T+42 days): Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n\nAt T+42 days: The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\nFinal update to the Constitution text.\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the \u2018First Cohort\u2019 and 6 members in the \u2018Second Cohort\u2019.

The protocol has experienced tremendous growth with innovations like its Restaking from Anywhere module, which allows users to restake their LRT from Arbitrum.\n* Connext facilitated and brought more than **$285m of LRTs to Arbitrum** in the last 3 months.\n* Connext volume through Arbitrum in the last 30 days was $280m\n\n![9a6944cf3c15fffb87f1cfd385e5ed1d338c6fcd_2_1035x363.png](ipfs://bafkreig6ai5hdwafn7dmsgjvvhnadl6a7buu72xnyu36ilrq5ycbz2kngi)\n    \n**Connext wants Arbitrum to succeed, and their priority remains to attract more users to bridge into Arbitrum and Restake ETH on the L2.**\n\n## Goal of the LTIPP incentives\nIncrease ETH TVL in the pools to provide better pricing for its integrated apps and their users\n\nHow (new strategy post feedback):\nincentivizing users who bridge into Arbitrum by subsidizing part of the bridging fees. This will further boost the utilization of the pools which will attract more liquidity. Higher TVL enables the best pricing when the Restaking module is used.\n\nIncentivizing users to bridge into Arbitrum has 2 benefits:\n\n1. It helps more users to bridge away from mainnet fees, onboarding them permanently onto Arbitrum\n2. It helps to rebalance the AMM pool, as the restaking activity tends to unbalance the pool in the opposite direction. Having a balanced pool means that users restaking ETH don\u2019t incur a negative price impact.\n\n## Changes from previous requests:\n\n* **Remove any liquidity incentivization for  routers and LPs, and shift focus towards users** \n* **Refund 95% of the fees to the users bridging into Arbitrum, up to 13bps**. Fees vary depending on the origin chain (from mainnet it\u2019s 9bps, from other L2s, 13bps) so only the actual fees incurred will be refunded.\nFees will only be subsidized to users who are onboarding to Arbitrum (from any other network), and users exiting Arbitrum will not get subsidized.\nThis is fully aligned with other crosschain protocols that saw their requests approved.\n\nThe estimate (according to the average of the last 7 days at the time of writing the original proposal) is for users to bridge 137k ETH during the pilot program.\n\nBridging fee rebate: 137,000 * 0.0013 (max fee) * 0.95 = 169 ETH\n\nTot ask: 446,472 ARB (1 ETH = 2,646.75 ARB at the time of writing)\n\nNote: pricing the ask in ARB vs ETH as the pair is less volatile\n\n## Expected milestones\n\nMonth 1: 45k ETH bridged into Arbitrum (30% of ARB distributed)\n\nMonth 2: 90k ETH bridged (60% of ARB)\n\nMonth 3: 137k ETH bridged ($100% of ARB)\n\nThe Connext team agrees to return to the Arbitrum DAO any unused ARB funds once the 12-week LTIPP program is concluded.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "7d115cf8-9352-4e41-b620-0e2bc74d03e5", "proposal_id": "29e416dc-bc25-4758-bcd5-8e6efe262769", "snapshot_id": "0x5bede8277e7fe0beef5764d2915d1d1c288fcc47747c6fa576b501f5cb3d6115", "title": "Request for Continuation of the Arbitrum DDA Program Request", "author_name": "0xAbAbE91A907fAdff921720C43ABe4098e7245E99", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5bede8277e7fe0beef5764d2915d1d1c288fcc47747c6fa576b501f5cb3d6115", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-03-11 00:01:05", "voting_end": "2024-03-18 00:01:05", "options": {"scores": [144792709.55550635, 583267.179118986, 3406681.7428028416], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-03-18 00:01:05", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.804", "body": "## **Summary**\n\nAs we near the end of allocating the initial grant budget (link to proposal), where through the [Arbitrum Grants Program ](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/) run via the Delegated Domain Allocation model by Questbook, $912k has already been allocated to over 60 proposals. Based on the overwhelming response and number of quality proposals the grant program has received, we propose to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters. We have received great feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators for requesting additional budget and continue funding projects through the delegated domain allocation model.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from Arbitrum DDA program, we propose renewing the Program with a budget of $4M for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Arbitrum\u2019s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the same domains as the previous program:\n\n|Domain|Domain Allocator|Proposed Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|New Protocol Ideas|Jojo|$920,000|\n|Gaming|Adam|$920,000|\n|Dev Tooling|Juandi|$920,000|\n|Education, Growth, Community and Events|Cattin (Seed Latam)|$920,000|\n\n**RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domain**\n\n1.

Education, Growth, Community and Events - [Link](https://www.notion.so/e8e86fbd9ee349beb0d9046607dae812?pvs=21)\n\n* We propose increasing the allocated grants budget for all domains equally to a higher budget based on the number of proposals received in the previous round.\n* Additionally, in the first round we set a soft cap of $25,000, and we propose increasing the cap to $50,000, with a few more steps for approving a grant that is larger than $25,000, requiring the involvement of two DAs to approve a proposal rather than just the specific domain allocator.\n* Considering the previous softcap being half of what is currently proposed, and that for an average of $220,000 for each domain the program was able to run for around 3.5 months before being maxed out, we project that providing 4X the amount of the previous iteration to each domain should allow the program to constantly allocate, at the same rate or even higher, for the full 6 months projected duration\n* The increased cap will allow the Questbook Program to keep covering the bootstrap belt of grant between $1,000 to $25,000 while, at the same time, be able to serve larger protocols that inherently might have larger needs.\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in the initial program, the renewed grants program will be run using **[Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/)**. Each *domain allocator* will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community.\n\nWhile the program has produced, accordingly to preliminary conversation with protocols and delegates, good results, we want to address and integrate the feedbacks so far proposed and partially covered in the previous section, such as:\n\n* have better accountability for the increased soft cap\n* define a more robust and structured set of rules for applicants, in regards to providing a timeline for their project(s)\n* define a cost for the management and verification of milestones after the program is completed\n* define a plan to manage the volatility of funds being distributed by the DAO in ARB token.\n\nThe DA will evaluate all the proposals through the rubrics provided for each domain, with the following framework:\n\n* in case of request below or equal to $25,000, the evaluation process will be the same of the previous iteration, with rubrics being evaluated and scored by the specific DA\n* in case of request above $25,000, and below the new soft cap of $50,000, the evaluation will involve a second DA, chosen by the first one based on the proximity of the specific expertise and knowledge to that proposal, that will have to publish a second evaluation of the rubrics alongside the score. Assuming N rubrics, scored from 1 to 5, the grant will be approved only if both the DA will give each a scoring equal or above to N*3.\n\nThe disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject the application based on evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator. The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs.\n\nAfter the end of two quarters, the grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to eventually, renew the program and, if so, change any specification of the domains, the domain allocators or the program manager.\n\nTo ensure predictability of the funding of the program and a proper runaway, upon receiving the amount from the DAO, the DAs alongside the PM will convert it in stables. If the protocols request it, specific grants or milestones might be paid in $ARB by converting the needed amount at the moment of payout.\n\nArbitrum DDA program closed accepting new proposals from mid February. If the program will be renewed in the terms above, the DDA program will take care, alongside the evaluation of new proposal, to keep evaluating the milestones of the previous program, thus allowing for the continuity of the previous iteration in an accountable way for grantees.\n\n### Compensation\n\nWe propose the following payment structure for the PM and DAs, with a base salary of $100/h and an increased projected workload of DA by 33% compared to the previous program, in consideration of the fact that DA not only have on average worked more than what initially was expected in the previous program, but also that they will need to spend time to cross evaluate all proposals above $25,000. On the other hand, the compensation of the PM is instead unchanged.\nWe are also adding overhead for an extra 6 months, equivalent to 20% of full-time salaries, for the Domain Allocators and the PM to keep evaluating the milestones of the grantees after the natural end of the program. This will ensure the proper continuation of the program and the followup with grantees, despite the program potentially not being renewed if so decided by the DAO.

They provided thorough explanations of their KPIs and goals and set out clear milestones.\nTheir justification of grant size was sufficient and they had a well-thought-out execution strategy that clearly targets increased TVL activity and users on Arbitrum. \nTheir product is highly composable and they have a large existing user base. Their emphasis on specifically rewarding existing ETH users to Arbitrum is a great idea.\nWe support this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis protocol identifies and tries to fill a specific need. The grant plan, however, could have been considerably stronger if it had 1) identified a past driver of growth, and 2) tailored the plan to replicate or extend that growth. In particular, rebates for fees deserve some data that shows it moves user activity. Recommend the applicant revise and resubmit in future grants cycles with this in mind,\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nI am generally positive about supporting Index Coop\u2019s application. They have a novel product, which has an offchain reach demonstrated by their partnership with eToro, CoinDesk and 21.co. In anticipation of RobinHood integrating Arbitrum to their app product-offering, and in consideration of the immense reach of mobile apps, I think that should Index Coop be successful it would greatly benefit Arbitrum as an ecosystem as well. Given that they partnered with etoro in Oct23, they could be a good fit to marry onchain with tradfi. Bitcoin ETF has been established with ETH ETF next, and I believe Index Coop would be a good fit for arbitrium for tradfi integration.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Index Coop's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across the rubric. Despite being newly deployed to Arbitrum, their proposal well captures their execution plan, target milestones/KPIs, how they plan to incentivize migration to Arbitrum from Ethereum, and provides strong justification behind their requested grant. Outside of this, their adoption/partnership with TradFi products like eToro is promising to potentially attract off-chain users (would like to understand if there's a strategy here).

The proposal aimed to allocate 100% of the LTIPP grant to onboard and reward users via these competitions. The focus was on trading competitions rather than fee rebates because competitions could significantly level the playing field  \u2014 ultimately boosting participation.

The proposal aims to deploy 95 total quests across 62 unique applications. The goal is to provide a comprehensive onboarding, educational, and interaction model that results in sustained user commitment and thus solidifies Arbitrum\u2019s position as a leading Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution.\n\nMotivation\n\nWe propose an innovative solution to address an opportunity that has surfaced following the execution of the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) \u2013 the need for effectively onboarding, educating, and retaining new users on the Arbitrum platforms that received STIP. The STIP successfully provides incentive to perform onchain actions, but it does not address the user onboarding experience aspect of attracting new users. This proposal is viewed as the missing puzzle piece to STIP. In addition, the STIP had teams qualify, but not receive funding, providing a situation we aim to reconcile by running additional quests for those teams that will improve user retention and increase usage of their protocols.\n\nRationale\n\nOur proposal aligns meticulously with Arbitrum\u2019s mission to foster an inclusive, vibrant, and engaged community. By ensuring all users - existing and new ones - are carried along inclusively and effectively via well-designed quests, we will be creating an environment that promotes continued learning, interaction, and commitment. This \u201csticky factor\u201d is critical for a sustainable and thriving ecosystem.\n\nKey Terms\n\nWhat are Quests?\nQuests are guided learning activities, organized around specific crypto protocols and apps. They are designed to familiarize users with different protocols, their processes, and the potential benefits they offer within ecosystems like DeFi on Arbitrum.\n\nWhy are Quests Helpful?\n\nQuests provide a hands-on learning experience which makes the understanding of complex protocols more enjoyable and interactive. They provide delightful step-by-step guidance which motivates users to explore and use these protocols, thereby increasing user adoption and contributing to the broader understanding of apps.\n\nFor instance, consider the quest on Layer3 called \u201cExploring Radiant\u201d. It guides users through learning about onmichain money markets, swapping, and depositing on Radiant, breaking down each step into comprehensible segments.\n\nBy engaging with the quest, users not only learn how to use the Radiant platform, but also get practical experience which they can apply in real-world situations. Quests like these play a crucial role in demystifying DeFi protocols, making them more accessible, and bringing users to Arbitrum.\n\nIn the case of Exploring Radiant, it managed to attract 31,181 completions. This demonstrates the high engagement rate and efficiency of quests as interactive learning tools in the DeFi space. The large number of participants signifies that the quest was not only successful in providing valuable insights about the protocol but also in garnering interest from a wider community, thereby increasing the adoption rate of the whole Radiant platform.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just Radiant.\n\nThere is a whole library of Arbitrum quests available on Layer3. As part of the STIP Enhancement and Inclusion Quest Proposal, a whole new category will be created on Layer3 to display the quests included in the STIP Enhancement and Inclusion Quest Program\n\nWhy Layer3?\nLayer3 has played a significant role in the growth of Arbitrum.\n\nWe\u2019ve guided over 337,613 users to complete more than 5.9 million on-chain transactions on Arbitrum, all at no cost to the user or Arbitrum DAO. Our initiatives, particularly interactive quests, have already greatly increased user engagement and education on Arbitrum.\n\nBy transforming onchain operations into bite-sized, step-by-step quests, we have managed to make Arbitrum accessible to a wider audience. We have made it accessible and comprehensible to users, regardless of their technical proficiency level.\n\nSpecifications:\nTeams:\nUpon approval, we will embark on the design and execution of 95 quests structured strategically for the following protocols and teams in direct support of the STIP.\n\nThis includes one quest for each STIP-qualified protocol (29 projects, one quest each) and two quests for each recipient that received a greater than 50% majority in favor of their STIP proposal and more than 71.51 million ARB in support for their proposal (33 projects, two quests each). Each quest is meticulously designed to enhance user comprehension, interaction, and loyalty to the respective protocols.\n\nThe list of protocols and teams includes but is not limited to:\n\n1\tCamelot, Jones, Dopex, GMX, LODESTAR, Socket, Timeswap, RADIANT, Pendle Finance, MUX, Frax, Tally, Rysk, Silo Finance, Stella, Good Entry, Gamma, Umami, Abracadabra, KyberSwap, OpenOcean, Angle, Trader Joe, Dolomite, Premia, Vertex, Perennial Finance, Balancer, WINR\n\n2\tWOOFi, Gains Netowrk, DefiEdge, Synapse Protocol, PancakeSwap, Notional Finance, Rodeo, Magpie, Stargate, Savvy, Tales of Elleria, Thales, TIDE, Solv Protocol, Furucombo, dForce, Sanko GameCorp, RAMSES, Vela Exchange, Thetanuts, JOJO Exchange, Wormhole, Shell Protocol, REALM, unshETH, StakeDAO, Curve, iZUMi, Beefy Finance, Arrakis Finance, Florence Finance, CVI, Prime Protocol\n\nPayment Terms:\nThe compensation for this proposal will encompass a real-time, continuous flow of 1 million ARB tokens, streamed via the Superfluid protocol. The stream will commence immediately post-approval and will run continuously up until May 19, 2024.\n\nShould we fall short of fulfilling our obligations at any point within the specified period, a new proposal can be initiated to stop the stream of funds.\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, we commit to providing regular progress updates and upon completion of each of the 3 phases and maintaining Dune Analytics impact dashboards for the duration of the initiative, both at the application and ecosystem level. In a scenario where we fail to deliver our commitments, the community possesses the full right to propose halting the stream until the matter is adequately addressed and resolved.\n\nSteps to Implement\n\nInitiate a cooperative process with all STIP-qualified protocols to design a unique quest for each, and create two additional quests for the teams that met the criteria but weren\u2019t granted STIP.\n\nImplement the quests in month-long phases, during which we will monitor user engagement, quest completion rates, and user feedback, among other indicators.\n\nImpact Analysis with Dune Dashboards: Post-sprint, we will analyze and present our impact utilizing detailed Dune dashboards. These dashboards will visually represent key metrics to paint a clear picture of the project\u2019s success. Metrics categories include user engagement, unique user rates, and protocol specific metrics.\n\nBy confronting these steps, we can continuously refine our approach, ensuring that we provide mutually beneficial outcomes for both users and protocols involved in the STIP program.\n\nPhase 1 - STIP Proposal Quests (November 2023 - January 2024): Quests specifically designed for all STIP-qualified protocols will be released in six groups, each running for a month. The intention is to boost user engagement with these protocols that have received official STIP funding and guide users on how to use STIP protocols.\n\nPhase 2 - Non-STIP Proposal Quests 1 (February 2024 - April 2024): The second phase focuses on those teams that met the STIP criteria but did not receive funding. This stage ensures that these projects also get beneficial visibility and user engagement through their initial quests.\n\nPhase 3 - Non-STIP Proposal Quests 2 (March 2024 - May 2024): The final phase continues the support for non-STIP funded projects, further providing engagement through a second quest for each team. This step is designed to maintain and enhance user interest and interaction, consolidating the engagement prompted in Phase 2.\n\nRunning two quests for non-STIP funded projects (Phase 2 and 3) is particularly beneficial as it contributes to user retention through a deeper experience with the protocol.\n\nThe first quest provides users with initial exposure to the protocol, its functions, and utility. It attracts & onboards new users and raises their curiosity, while also providing a sense of familiarity and comfort with the protocol.\nThe second quest aims to solidify this relationship. A user returns to reinforce their understanding and re-engage with the protocol \u2013 a follow-up to further strengthen the interaction between the user and protocol.\nThe aim is to attract users and provide a solid foundation for them to be engaged, active and aligned with the protocol over a longer period. This ultimately contributes to the longevity and sustainability of each protocol.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to target attention to each group of protocols, ensuring each has optimized quests and yields the best possible results for all involved.\n\nOverall Cost Estimate:\nThe total cost to implement this AIP is 1M ARB where:\n\nRecurring costs will entail updates and maintenance, community engagement efforts, partnerships, performance tracking, and reporting.\n\nThis proposal lends to Arbitrum\u2019s goal to build an engaged and knowledgeable community committed to the platform\u2019s longevity. By incorporating all users in a guided and rewarding learning journey, we act as a funnel for new Arbitrum users, rather than current participants dominating rewards. By also acknowledging and rewarding the efforts of teams that did not qualify for STIP, we foster a fairer and more inclusive community spirit, further underlining Arbitrum\u2019s commitment to its members.\n\nThis dynamic, transparent, and comprehensive approach propels the strength and sustainability of the Arbitrum community.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "81c76077-0615-465a-87e4-eda49a30bd7c", "proposal_id": "5dcb102d-c118-42b1-987c-a2f3e5452219", "snapshot_id": "0xc040de9c6a85dee5ca15de10691165bf5595245ffac922cbef61e45199522345", "title": "Proposal to Backfund Successful STIP Proposals", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc040de9c6a85dee5ca15de10691165bf5595245ffac922cbef61e45199522345", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-11-07 14:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-11-14 14:00:00", "options": {"scores": [132414249.6843938, 48847543.35034749, 14380835.277159804], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-11-14 14:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.989", "body": "# Empowering STIP to measure the impact of incentives for new builders\n\n![394a4797e0b4068e1290ae30aaf14db7e8b7ff72_2_1000x1000.jpg](ipfs://bafybeie62x7l7qgdl5vf2d2rqs5qvt6vrosprdun3qzr7alm4k66idntie)    \n\n**Call to Action for Arbitrum ecosystem**\n\nThis proposal represents a critical opportunity for our community to:\n\n* Support diverse, emerging builders and make Arbitrum a welcoming environment for new projects\n* Double the sample size and diversity of stages and categories in the STIP data set\n* Uphold constitutional values of Inclusion vs Exclusion\n* Avoid potentially irreversible harm of crushing small, high potential builders\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* This proposal draft has been prepared by the Arbitrum STIP Inclusion Working Group following a series of community calls and workshops involving various stakeholders. As a preliminary document, it seeks input from both the Arbitrum DAO and the Liquidity Working Group.\n* This proposal frequently cites AIP-9.\n* For all of our resources see here: [svy.gg/stip-backfund (DocSend)](https:/svy.gg/stip-backfund)\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a one-time backfund to all \"approved but not funded proposals\u2019\u2019 from Arbitrum STIP. The proposed AIP increases the total budget by 21.4M to 71.4M while increasing the total participating protocols by 26, for a total of 56 funded projects. The program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while leveraging distribution systems, consensus, and delegate diligence already created from STIP 1.\n\nThis program is designed to backfund approved protocols while maintaining the timelines and systems of STIP 1:\n\n* Timeline: The program is scheduled to commence and conclude concurrently with STIP 1, or within a similar timeframe, starting from the first week of November and running through January 31, 2024.\n* KYC: The program will utilize the same KYC system as STIP 1.\n* Reporting: Participating grantees are required to self-report data, maintain dashboards, and regularly summarize grant performance\n\n# Considerations\n\nBefore this proposal was drafted, a working group was formed to gauge sentiment, gather key data points, and outline the proposal's structure. The working group collaborated with delegates and projects affected by the STIP, engaging in multiple calls\u2014including sessions with the creators of the STIP and the Incentive Working Group\u2014to solicit feedback and refine the proposal accordingly.\n\nKey concerns discussed include:\n\n### Why not just push towards a round 2 and go through voting for all proposals again?\n\nFirst and foremost, we believe that the successful execution of this Backfund proposal will, in time, serve as a crucial catalyst for future grant structures, including a successful STIP round 2. Why? This opportunity will unify the Arbitrum ecosystem by addressing key weaknesses in the original STIP 1 structure by quickly providing approved projects and other stakeholders with the resources/data needed to design and support future programs.\n\nKey issues associated with delaying an immediate backfund and moving towards a round 2 include:\n\n* Proper design and execution add considerable time delay to a highly competitive environment within Arbitrum and other L2s\n* Requires teams with limited resources approved already for STIP 1 to spend significant time lobbying delegates\n* Removes attention away from new Round 2 proposals\n* Adds additional burden to delegates that should be focused on long-term design improvements and new STIP grants not yet approved\n* Removes key data for STIP experiment analysis by skewing learnings towards larger, well-established projects\n* Delays the alignment of the STIP with the Arbitrum constitution values of inclusivity and diversity\n* Negatively impacts new builder sentiment towards Arbitrum at a critical time in the L2 Wars\n\n\n### The budget set aside was 50M, and the DAO decided that was the acceptable spend for a short-term incentive.\n\nWhile the budget was set at 50M, the original working group proposed 75M so that:\n\n> \"The budget was raised to 75M ARB to accommodate larger protocols (Pinnacle Grants) without compromising smaller applications.\" [tnorm, September 3rd 2023.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131/12)\n\nExcess demand was a significant possibility due to the high interest in STIP and the absence of a cap for Pinnacle grants. Voters lacked the data to ascertain whether the initial 50M would be adequate to achieve the objectives of STIP.\n\nNoteworthy is that, in the event of excess demand, measures including backfunding were already outlined as potential options.\n\nProper design and fulfillment of a Round 2 or similar future funding programs may take time to develop. Meanwhile, projects that received approval but no funding have immediate initiatives requiring support. Our opportunity is to fund these initiatives, level the competitive playing field, and enhance the data available for the STIP process.\n\n \n![3698b8811ac5887c127ab2bbfc94d7f6dcbd554a_2_624x285.jpg](ipfs://bafkreibtmidazgguawh6jfzjpsmn35br2qv3uba23zvdz3kffhdwc4hyj4)\n \n![8487c56a2a8f7c7f6dd102ad36e9a20b7459b041_2_624x356.png](ipfs://bafybeihuzqen65up5nh4t666unrsu6i7mtdbazw2tcicvqewmmrx2j3zdy)\n    \n    \n\n\n### Voting behaviors for a 50M proposal shouldn\u2019t carry over to a proposal that includes the additional backfunded amounts.\n\nDuring our consultation process, we engaged in numerous discussions that brought forth questions about backfunding. Despite the criticisms, backfunding remains the most straightforward method to address the current STIP\u2019s skewed sample size. We advocate that backfunding is the optimal approach to achieve the STIP\u2019s intended outcomes\u2014specifically, to examine the impact that incentives have on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\nFurthermore, if the STIP continues without rectifying the issues with its sample, the analysis will be compromised by a significant methodological flaw. Backfunding is not just the \u201cbest\u201d option; it is essential for preserving the integrity of the STIP overall.\n\nVoting behavior might have differed if the budget cap were set at 75M or 100M. The only way to determine this would be to repeat the experiment with a raised cap (an option that is unfeasible as time travel has not yet been realized).\n\nIt's helpful for us to remember the original objectives of the STIP:\n\n* To provide incentives to a diverse and inclusive group of Arbitrum projects.\n* To quickly establish an incentives program that is in harmony with Arbitrum's values and constitution.\n* To generate robust, meaningful data to shape the future design of Arbitrum grants for projects of all types and sizes.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\n> Motivation - A statement on why the Arbitrum community should implement the AIP.\n\nHow can Arbitrum create an incentives structure to grow the ecosystem? STIP started when the community began investigating creative uses for incentives. A short-term program was devised to act quickly, collect data about how incentives are used by Arbitrum protocols, and learn from the results to design new programs and grow the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nAn unexpected budget problem caused many successful STIP applications to receive no funding. The real-world consequence of this mistake caused the STIP sample to be cut in half - but not at random. To determine the final STIP cohort, the applications were sorted by approval, which inadvertently skewed the sample towards incumbent protocols. This sampling bias is most egregious for collecting data about the smallest protocols; over 70% of Beacon grants were rejected due to the sorting algorithm that was used. Consequently, STIP may not be collecting sufficient data about new builders on Arbitrum.\n\nThis AIP seeks to achieve STIP's original motivations by:\n\n1) nearly doubling the sample size;\n2) adding protocols across a broad array of industry categories; and\n3) including protocols at different stages of development.\n\nThis AIP will ensure an important builder population is included in the study, while increasing the validity of the STIP results.\n\nOne of the most important questions facing Arbitrum today is how to grow the ecosystem and win the L2 Wars. STIP is a novel study on the impact of incentives for growing the Arbitrum ecosystem. In practice, the STIP excluded most new builders from the study, severely limiting the data that will be collected about the early stages of the builder pipeline. This AIP includes a broader range of protocols in the STIP study, ensuring that Arbitrum gets the data it needs about how incentives impact new builders in the Arbitrum ecosystem. It stands to reason that extending incentives to smaller projects could serve to incubate projects that grow into the high-usage dApps of tomorrow. Extending the STIP may not only increase the inclusivity of the program but also incentivize significant growth for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem at a lower cost per project, and this possibility is worth exploring.\n\n# Rationale\n\n`Rationale - An explanation of how the AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values`\n\nArbitrum's community values highlight the importance of diversity, which increases the fitness of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem by representing the needs of many kinds of participants. The original work to design STIP was careful to consider how both large and small protocols would fare under the framework. However, the unexpected budget cutoff caused the sample to skew towards large protocols, which is at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community. The cost of falling short of this ideal is that STIP systematically overlooks the possibility that incentives might be uniquely interesting to small and new protocols. By failing to incorporate protocols at the first stages of the builders onboarding pipeline, Arbitrum will be unsure about how incentives operate among this crucial group of protocols.\n\nThe Arbitrum community also values neutrality, which received careful consideration during the STIP design stages. It was well-understood that incumbent protocols were likely to prevail with their STIP applications - but it was hoped this would not preclude smaller participants from also being funded. Unfortunately, this wish for inclusion was not fulfilled and - unintentional though it may have been - funding was nevertheless distributed according to a ranking that was likely to favor incumbents. Again, despite the best efforts of the DAO and the STIP designers, the result was at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community.\n\nAbove all, Arbitrum seeks to create and nurture a thriving ecosystem - and the DAO's values are designed to provide guiding values that will always trend towards the health of the ecosystem. When the values aren't met - even unintentionally - it is possible the best interests of the ecosystem aren't met, either. In the case of STIP, accidentally excluding Beacon grants falls short of the community values - which, in all likelihood, is a critical oversight that Arbitrum would benefit from fixing.\n\n# Key Terms:\n\n- Approved but not funded STIP proposals\n- AIP-9\n- Backfund\n- Extension\n- STIP\n- STIP Round 1\n- STIP Backfunded\n\n# Specifications:\n\n`Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.`\n\nWill approve funding of an additional 21.4M ARB through the end of January 31, 2024.\n\nPlease note the STIP Backfund will leverage the multiple sections of [AIP-9](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131) such as [Specification section](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5) and [Outstanding Questions and Concerns](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#outstanding-questions-and-concerns-13) and specifically:\n\n* [Financial Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5)\n* [Multisig Setup](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7)\n* [Eligibility Requirements](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6) and [Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7).\n* [KPIs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6)\n\nSteps to Implement - \nThe steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable.

Their team brings deep expertise in data engineering, advanced modeling, simulations, and mechanism design.\n\nThe firm employs a rigorous Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach to token design and simulation, ensuring a systematic, well-structured process for creating and parameterizing mechanisms. This comprehensive process includes multiple phases: research, objective definition, design concept generation, concept selection, simulations, parameterisation, and final delivery. Vending Machine has also successfully delivered projects for high-profile clients such as Fuel Network, Arch Network, Berachain, and Everclear, among others.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nThe scope of work we propose to complete for ArbitrumDAO is to conduct a comprehensive design process for ARB staking and governance attack vectors. This scope will cover two months of the six-month period, which is the typical duration of our design process, pre-simulations. From our time participating within the DAO\u2019s staking working groups, it is clear that there is a need for a team to be fully accountable for delivering a comprehensive end-to-end exploration of what the future of the ARB token could look like, as well as exploring and resolving any security threats via governance attacks.\n\nOur work will pick up where we left off in the working group. We will take the research conducted in this group to supplement our design process. With this, Vending Machine will guide the DAO through an end-to-end design, where we will:\n\n\n\n* **Conduct stakeholder interviews** to define system objectives and requirements\n* **Create multiple design concepts** and present these to the DAO for discussion and feedback\n* **Iterate if necessary and select the final design** with the DAO\n\nAfter the 2-month period where we draft a proposed design to the DAO for feedback, if it is deemed worthwhile to continue exploration, we will then:\n\n\n\n* **Build a model of the token system** to parameterize the design\n* **Simulate the design** and present the DAO with a simulation report\n* **Present the DAO with a fully parameterized token design**\n\nThroughout this process, we will post updates to the forum so that the DAO and key stakeholders can share feedback, allowing them to be part of the design process.\n\nBy the end of the process, the DAO will have a fully designed and simulated token system that addresses governance concerns while also potentially extending the utility of the ARB token.\n\nWith our wide skill set expanding across risk, incentive design, modelling, and simulating, we can remain flexible to other tasks the Supervisory Council puts forward.\n\nHere are some examples of what the DAO could expect in terms of deliverables. Each deliverable would be delivered in the public forum.\n\n\n\n1. **Preliminary System Architecture Documentation:** an outline of the existing stakeholders and mechanisms in the Arbitrum Ecosystem, as well as value exchange mapping.\n2. **Design Objectives, Requirements and Constraints Documentation:** an outline of the objectives of the design, the requirements of the design and the constraints of the design surface area.\n3. **Design Concept Generation Documentation:** construction of multiple mechanism designs that would achieve the objectives, requirements and constraints previously outlined.\n4. **Final Design Concept Documentation:** a document that clearly outlines the architecture of the final design, ready for simulations.\n\nAnd if the DAO deemed it important to continue exploring the design, Vending Machine would then deliver:\n\n\n\n1. **Final Design Simulation Model:** a python based model of the design to stress-test and parameterise the mechanism.\n2. **Final Design Documentation:** a document breaking down the final design and optimal parameter settings as defined by the simulation process.\n\n\n# **TAU Labs**\n\n* **Name:** [TAU Labs](https://www.628labs.xyz/)\n* **Telegram Handles:** [Pixel2904], [TauKatana], [gm_0xKepler], [OxCypherPeak], [RogerTennis1]\n* **Email Addresses:** vladt@628labs.xyz 0xkepler@628labs.xyz Katherine Long alexander.zahnd@gmail.com rogger@628labs.xyz\n* **The role being applied for:** Risk Working Member\n* **Hourly Rate (in USDC):**$125/hr for access to the entire TAU Labs team\n\n\n## **Experience**\n\nTAU Labs is a Tokenomics and Data Science Lab specialising in token and incentive engineering, financial modeling, economic simulations, and mechanism design. Over the past year, they have worked with more than 15 clients, with a focus on DeFi protocols, such as MORE Markets, [Rain.FI](http://rain.fi/), and YieldNest among others.\n\nTheir multidisciplinary team includes data scientists, chartered financial analysts, and DeFi specialists. TAU Labs is particularly skilled in data science and economic modeling, leveraging Monte Carlo simulations and rigorous stress testing to ensure resilient risk management. They enhance transparency and stakeholder engagement by delivering **public Machinations models** and custom-built **Python dashboards**, making their research and recommendations accessible and actionable for all stakeholders.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nGiven the success of the STIP and LTIPP programs, we would like to continue to explore data-driven incentive distribution to boost TVL and trading volumes for DeFi protocols, as well as the usage of Arbitrum apps more generally.\n\nStrategically allocating incentives based on pre-determined goals such as liquidity and market share has proven effective as a macro level optimization.\n\nWe believe further optimizations are possible on a micro, per-user level. By utilizing onchain (and potentially offchain data), we can further segment users by expected lifetime value and related metrics such as retention, wallet net worth, etc.\n\nOne-third of the 6-month term would be dedicated to build upon the existing analysis of LTIPP and STIP programs to push improvements at the macro level. Additionally, TAU Labs will provide the DAO a range of suggestions for incentive designs and micro level optimizations.\n\n\n\n* Summarize key findings from existing LTIPP and STIP analysis and foster it with secondary research. Fill gaps with primary research\n* Identify room for optimization on the macro level\n* Ideate micro level optimizations through user segmentation. Discuss tradeoffs and feasibility with the DAO, then plan, budget, and execute experiments for multiple promising approaches to generate insights\n* Provide a final report with key learnings\n\nThroughout the term, TAU will be at the DAO\u2019s disposal to work on other tasks the Supervisory Council puts forward. Given our expertise in protocol design, tokenomics, and economic modeling, we are flexible enough to work on any relevant task.\n\n\n# **Jupiter Block**\n\n\n\n* **Applicant:** JupiterBlock [JB Advisory Services SEZC]\n* Telegram Handle: @rtudor\n* LinkedIn Profile: [Ramona Tudorancea - JupiterBlock | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rtudorancea/)\n* The role being applied for: Risk Working Member\n* Hourly Rate (in USDC): 350 USDC for senior / executive / NED level, and 150 USDC for supervised junior / lawyer level\n\n\n## **Experience**\n\nJupiter Block is an experienced law firm specialising in Web3 projects, Cayman foundation companies, BVI tokenization structures, investment funds, capital markets, M&A, Strategy as well as Risk Management and Governance. They are building a decentralized risk management framework based on an application of ERM in a decentralized setting, with a risk dashboard and Guardian Roles.\n\nMore recently they published a research paper with the Crypto Valley Association relating to DAO legal wrappers, DAOs as automated cybernetic organisms and risk management frameworks in DAOs, also serving as members of the LexDAO operating committee and co-founding [Ixian.tech](http://ixian.tech/), a hybrid law, management and Web3 legal engineering firm building legal products for the world of tomorrow.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nLike all decentralized projects, I believe (also based on interactions and conversations) that Arbitrum is confronted with a strategic and management gap. On the risk side, it is important to be aware of the good practices developed in other industries and fields, and adopt a holistic approach, and I believe that I could support this build. With developer resources and assistance from the Arbitrum communities, a decentralized risk management framework could be developed comparable to what ERM is currently for traditional organizations. This would improve the quality of interactions and increase credibility for Arbitrum overall. I could develop the general outline and framework for the first couple of months in approx. 25-30 hours of work and then work together with devs for the build, for another 50-75 hours of work.

Notably, Arbitrum was one of the first chains reviewed using DeFiSafety\u2019s chain scores process. The team\u2019s risk management expertise originates from their prior careers in aerospace, specifically in avionics, ensuring a methodical, safety-first approach to their work.\n\nDeFiSafety's core output is its protocol review reports, with more than 300 publicly available on their website. They have collaborated with top-tier DeFi protocols on various initiatives, such as the Compound Protocol Multisig Improvement Program, which aimed to mitigate risks associated with lost keys and enhance trust in multisig wallets through increased transparency. Additionally, they have delivered independent chain reports to evaluate the security and performance of various L1 and L2 chains, as well as token risk assessment reports.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nFirst off, we will execute the tasks requested by the Supervisory Council. We work for you. A personal recommendation within the first six months would be development of a risk management plan. Arbitrum is in a very risky sector. Block chains are new. Layer 2\u2019s are new. Yet, despite how technical our industry is, formal risk management is seldom found. We face many very large risks.\n\nTherefore we recommend that through a series of meetings we develop a top level and mid-level risk management description with mitigations. Plans such as this focus DAO members on what is important and offer justification for investment in mitigation plans. We would estimate a spend of 30k over the first 2 month.\n\nWe would also suggest that Arbitrum consider a quality system. A quality system tells new users what is safe because they follow audited best practices. My opinion is that we will not have new user growth without a quality system. If a large chain like Arbitrum cannot indicate which wallet is safe to use and which protocols are safe to use, how can we expect add users.\n\n\n# **Nethermind**\n\n\n\n* **Applicant**: Nethermind Research\n* **Applicant Representative**: James Baggett\n* **Applicant Website**: [website](https://www.nethermind.io/nethermind-research)\n* **Telegram Handle**: @jamesbaggett\n* **Role being applied for**: Risk Working Member\n* **Hourly Rate (in USDC)**:\n    * **Mid Level Researcher**: $130 per hour\n    * **Senior Level Researcher**: $180 per hour\n\n\n## **Experience**\n\nNethermind is a leading infrastructure builder, researcher and core development team in the blockchain space.

Warner, and Frisson. The three council members have appointed Pedro Breuer as an OAT council member and are in final stage conversations with an identified candidate. All council members, alongside the Arbitrum Foundation, are now working towards operationalizing the OpCo entity and hiring the initial team to lead the organisation.\n\nIn the course of our work we reviewed the original OpCo proposal to fully internalize its mandate and operational capability. We discovered a number of restrictions during this process that may hinder the OpCo\u2019s ability to fulfil its mission, attract the best talent who can contribute towards the OpCo\u2019s success, and prevent the OpCo from proactively working on initiatives that can lead to future proposals in the DAO.\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to go through each identified restriction, how it may impact the OpCo\u2019s operational capability, and a proposed fix that can resolve the restrictions.\n\n## Restrictions Identified & Proposed Solutions\n\nWe\u2019ll take this opportunity to go through each restriction alongside the proposed updates for the OpCo. Keep in mind, we will pick the problem statement from the OpCo proposal that most accurately reflects the problem, as sometimes the same restriction is repeated several times in the proposal.\n\n### Inability to Interact with Service Providers\n\n* **Problem:** It\u2019s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm).\n\nThe OpCo is unable to enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors unless it is related to its own operational needs.\n\nTo illustrate the issue, let\u2019s consider an example where a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO and the OpCo thinks it may be valuable for the ecosystem. Unfortunately, the OpCo cannot engage with a consulting firm to evaluate the idea. The only option available for OpCo is to encourage the contributor to seek permission (and potential funding from exploratory work) from the DAO.\n\nWe believe this situation is counter to the OpCo\u2019s core mandate to support preliminary work on potentially promising proposals before it reaches the DAO. It should have the freedom to engage third parties, when necessary, to work on initiatives that it believes will receive a positive response from the DAO.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo has the authority to enter contracts with service providers or individual contributors for any matter it deems necessary to fulfil its mandate to support the ArbitrumDAO. The OAT will offer its recommendation to help adjudicate agreements.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to enter agreements with service providers or individual contributors alongside allowing the OAT to provide oversight on whether the agreement indeed fulfils the mandate of supporting the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Restrictive Treasury Spend\n\n* **Problem:** OpCo\u2019s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity\u2019s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo\u2019s oversight committee.\n\nThe OpCo restricts its budget to only be used for operational costs related to employees, running the organisation, and administrative costs.\n\nWe can re-use the previous example to highlight the issue. Let\u2019s assume a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO. The OpCo cannot offer a grant to the contributor to investigate the idea further, in a similar manner to M&A Pilot or the Arbitrum Venture Initiative Pilot. To obtain any exploratory funding, the OpCo will need to work with the contributor on a proposal for the DAO, as opposed to offering its own funds to support preliminary work.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo\u2019s capital should be reserved to cover the costs of administrative and operational duties as approved by the OAT, but any excess capital that is available can be used on a discretionary basis to fulfil its mandate as a proactive entity in the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to spend funds on a discretionary basis with oversight of the OAT. We believe this is mandatory to ensure the OpCo can be \u2018proactive, meaning if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developers could be made, it can propose a strategy\u2019 as written in the original proposal.\n\n### Compensation for OpCo Employees\n\n* **Problem:** 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo\u2019s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees\u2019 payouts additionally being performance-based.\n\nIn many organisations, it is common for employees to have a base salary, token agreement that vests over time as a structure of the initial compensation package, and a bonus structure for good performance. We believe the bonus pool should be available to support token agreements as well as bonuses.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** 4M ARB allocated to a compensation pool and bonus pool for internal employees and the OpCo\u2019s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). The compensation pool should be paid out in ARB with a vesting schedule, while the bonus pool shall be denominated in ARB, available for employees only and shall be performance-based. The exact split between the compensation pool and bonus pool shall be determined by the OAT Council.\n\nThis will offer the optionality to offer future employees a token vesting agreement alongside a bonus structure for performance related compensation.\n\n### Restrictions Around Council Elections.\n\n* **Problem:** Any individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-observing seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative\u2019s or DAO-adjacent entity\u2019s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\nThe initial restrictions were crafted to prevent conflicts of interests for OAT council members, but as we have witnessed in the previous election, several promising candidates who generally have the best interests in Arbitrum in mind were unable to apply and join the OAT. For example, tnorm was unable to apply as it would restrict Gauntlet\u2019s ability to enter service level agreements.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** An individual will be entitled to run as a candidate for the election. No single organisation should be overly represented in the OAT. There should be no more than 1 candidate associated with a single entity. No candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO which include, but not limited to: affiliates with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others. If a candidate is elected on behalf of an organisation, then the OAT membership is tied to them and cannot be rotated to someone else in the organisation. It will be up to the current OAT to enforce the above policy, and if a candidate is excluded from the election, then the rationale must be publicly disclosed to the ArbitrumDAO. If the DAO disagrees, they can initiate a vote with a non-constitutional quorum to overturn the OAT\u2019s decision to exclude a candidate.\n\nThe proposed fix is inspired by the eligibility policy that is applied to Arbitrum\u2019s Security Council as outlined in the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s constitution. It relies on the current OAT to enforce the policy, but if the ArbitrumDAO disagrees with the decision, they can overturn with a vote that achieves a non-constitutional quorum.\n\nOAT members are no longer required to relinquish their role as contributors within the ArbitrumDAO and are allowed to be a member of other DAO-adjacent entity oversight committees. The motivation is to ensure talented individuals can continue to support initiatives in the ArbitrumDAO while offering their expertise to help the OAT navigate its own future. Of course, a contributor may voluntarily decide to relinquish some roles depending on time commitments, to ensure they can dedicate themselves to this role.\n\nFinally, if an OAT member is affiliated with an entity, that entity is no longer prevented from engaging in service provider contracts with the OpCo. Keep in mind, there will be a conflict of interest policy that will require a conflicted OAT member to recuse themselves on all matters related to that entity or any service agreement signed with OpCo.\n\n### Declaring Conflict of Interest\n\n* **Problem:** Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe believe this requirement is overkill as a requirement for the OAT elections. It is important that direct conflicts of interests are disclosed (e.g., working at a competitor), but potential conflicts of interests can become impractical for certain user profiles (e.g., prolific investors) who have valuable networks and skillsets that can be beneficial to the council. It is easier for potential conflicts to be handled within the council as they must be disclosed when necessary and the conflicted OAT member must exclude themselves from the matter.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed fix:** All OAT members are required to publicly disclose actual conflicts of interests (e.g., employed by a competitor) at the time of proposing themselves as a candidate for the OAT election. Potential conflicts of interest should be privately declared, when required and if elected as an OAT member, with the OAT council. If the remaining OAT council believe it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be excluded from voting.\n\nOur proposed fix aims to strike a balance. Candidates for the OAT election are required to publicly disclose direct conflicts, in a similar manner as Arbitrum\u2019s Security Council elections. If the candidate is elected as an OAT member, then they can disclose potential conflicts of interests with the remaining members of the OAT council. If the OAT council believes it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be forced to recluse themselves from the matter at hand.\n\n### Ecosystem Support or Financial Management only\n\n* **Problem:** As initiated, OpCo\u2019s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates.\n\nThe original proposal fixed the mandate of OpCo to only focus on ecosystem support or financial management unless there is an additional proposal that expands its scope. We are weary about pigeon-holing the OpCo\u2019s mandate before it is operational as there are many verticals that can arise that the OpCo is best suited to tackle, but it is unable to do so without an explicit vote by the ArbitrumDAO. For example, taking the reins on governance related matters in the ArbitrumDAO seems like a natural fit for OpCo, but at present it is unable to take up that mantle due to this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, since the OpCo will offer oversight capabilities for proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO and executed by others (like AAEs, contributors, etc), it should have the full freedom to take that on without contention on whether it is focused on ecosystem support, financial management or whether the DAO needs to approve a new domain for OpCo. In fact, as written in the proposal, the OpCo should proactively work on identifying opportunities and we believe restricting the OpCo to specific categories can be problematic in this pursuit.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo\u2019s core mandate is to work on, facilitate, and provide operational and oversight support for strategies that have the potential to benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe proposed fix will allow the OpCo to proactively work on and experiment with new strategies and verticals that it believes the ArbitrumDAO may positively vote on in the future. For example, it can begin work on a proposal focused on improving governance in the DAO or a future grant program for public goods. This can enable the OpCo to operate in a flexible manner with rough consensus amongst delegates and the OAT on initiatives it believes will ultimately benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nOf course, to carry out any large initiative, the OpCo will still need to request funds from the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s treasury, so this flexibility should be viewed as enabling small-scale experiments by the OpCo and proactive work towards acquiring future funding when it is required on domains that it believes is important for the DAO\u2019s success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed fixes should enable the OpCo to voluntarily enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors using discretionary funding available to help access additional resources to fulfil its mandate to the DAO. Additionally, it helps fix the compensation structure for OpCo employees to be in line with industry standards and relaxes restrictions for OAT council elections to enable attract more candidates who have the interests of Arbitrun in mind.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "8560a5d9-9e85-496c-8ce7-ce1a369bad34", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xe213f7a4e3093ac66bc614b12c83976d5b075b58380edccdffd58349b82a0a1f", "title": "Socket STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0xF4B0556B9B6F53E00A1FDD2b0478Ce841991D8fA", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe213f7a4e3093ac66bc614b12c83976d5b075b58380edccdffd58349b82a0a1f", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [182790934.9132889, 3387731.4404908777, 12087165.121930664], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.413", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

As a reminder, the existing AGV Council\u2019s nominations are Tim Chang, with core competency in Venture Capital and Investments, and John Kennedy, with core Competency in Game Development and Go-To-Market Leader\n\n# Rationale\n\nBuilding on the governance practice established with AGV and subsequently OpCo, which combined appointed and elected positions, this election proposes a hybrid approach for filling council seats.\n\nEnsuring continuity of institutional knowledge across our oversight, advisory, and investment programs is critical for effective governance. Having experienced DAO representatives who understand our historical context and strategic direction, independent of the operational team hired to lead these initiatives, helps maintain stability during transitions and preserves organizational memory that might otherwise be lost.\n\nTo address this need, the existing AGV council has voted to nominate two candidates for continuity seats, subject to DAO reconfirmation prior to the election, with three additional seats open for a DAO-wide election.\n\n# Council Nomination: Tim Chang\n\nBelow are the extended details of the nominee for reconfirmation:\n\n**Role / Expertise**\n\nVenture Capital Leader\n\n**Bio**\n\nTim previously led consumer technology investments at Mayfield Fund, focusing on next-gen Commerce & Marketplaces, Communities, Health & Wellness, Gaming and Digital Media, and has been named twice to the Forbes Midas List of top 100 VCs in the world for his early-stage investments at the beginning of the social and mobile smartphone gaming eras.\n\nTim has also been named to the AlwaysOn Power Players of top investors, as well as receiving the Special Achievement award from the Gamification Summit for his work in leveraging game design thinking to domains beyond gaming.\n\nTim has led early-stage investments in Grove Collaborative, Tonal Fitness, Fitmob/Classpass, Iridigm Display, Playdom, ngmoco, Basis, AdChina, Moat, and Pillow, creating more than $2.6B in total exit value. His current board seats include Alignable and TRIPP VR.\n\nHe holds an MBA with honors from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a MSEE/BSEE from the University of Michigan, where he received a departmental scholar fellowship. Tim has also been an active and avid investor in Web3/blockchain since 2014, helping to establish and invest in early crypto hedge funds, as well as advising and supporting multiple web3 gaming startups.\n\nOutside of his passion for venture and startups, Tim is also a proponent of healing and flourishing of Mind, Body and Spirit, and serves on the non-profit boards of California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS), and Ecoversity, and formerly served on the nonprofit boards of Little Kids Rock, NorthStar.guide, Gray Area Arts and Reimagine Death, as well as advising Transformative Tech Lab, Consciousness Hacking, Building Bridges, Near Future Summit, Edmund Hillary Fellowship, GoldHouse, Berklee School of Music, and other efforts to uplevel Capitalism with greater consciousness, regenerative models and inclusive stakeholding. His impact efforts include supporting MAPS and co-founding Northstar.guide to ethically commercialize psychedelic medicine, and he is dedicated to supporting Men\u2019s Work, greater financial literacy for Women and Girls, ethical design principles for AI and tech products, and regenerative agriculture/Permaculture.\n\nTim is the cofounder of a cutting-edge social wellness members club called The Portal (https://theportal.house) in the San Francisco Bay Area, with additional locations opening soon.\n\n**Major AGV Accomplishments:**\n\n* Guided initial thesis creation and subsequent thesis evolutions.\n* Worked with the team to create infrastructure, including approval processes, IC review rituals, memo templating, risk management parameters, best practices, due diligence checklist, as well as how to assess behind-the-scenes deal, team and investor syndicate dynamics.\n* Acted as a source of additional context, given his large VC/founder network for deals with known founders, co-investors, and other strategic partners.\n* Provided 23 years\u2019 worth of early-stage venture investment expertise and wisdom as advisory and due diligence support for all deal leads that advanced through the IC pipeline in 2025.\n\n**Why are you interested in serving on the AGV Council again?**\n\n\u201cI genuinely enjoy working with the people on the investment team and the wider AGV stakeholders. This is a unique experiment and opportunity for a leading L2 network to pioneer what DAOs can do, and the mandate to grow one of the largest verticals within entertainment and gaming is exciting. There are challenges, but I have always believed in forging new frontiers while accepting the risks that come with innovation. I have advised multiple Fortune 500 corporations in forming and implementing corporate strategic investment programs, and to do something similar for the AGV is a chance to build an investment and ecosystem program in a wholly new format for the web3 world. I\u2019m proud to be part of this journey, and hold huge hopes for how Arbitrum and web3 overall can bolster the leading edge of gaming and gamified experiences, as well as the convergence of generative AI with blockchain.\u201d\n\n# Timeline\n\nAn Introduction and Q&A Call was held via Google Meet on November 13th at 5pm UTC.\n\nEach nominated candidate will undergo a separate confirmation Snapshot vote on Thursday, November 20th (this post).\n\n# Voting Options\n\nThis proposal will include the following voting options:\n\n* For\n* Against\n* Abstain\n\nShould FOR be the majority preference, and the combined FOR and ABSTAIN votes meet at least 3% of the total votable ARB supply, the respective candidate will be considered reconfirmed to the AGV council for the 2026 term.\n\nIf this nomination is vetoed by the DAO, that seat will then be added to the Election Process, and the nominee will be automatically entered as an applicant for the Election.

We would have preferred to see the applicant highlight something that had already worked well in the past, identified the mechanism responsible, and tailored a grant request to scaling or replicating that past success. The requested amount is simply too much for experimentation unless the plan also includes very rigorous milestones to meet in order to unlock full funding.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n Integral's grant proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to grow the liquidity on Arbitrum, focusing on enhancing the trading experience and growing platform adoption. The allocation of rewards for LPs and integration efforts with aggregators reflects a well-considered approach to incentivizing participation. The emphasis on sustainable growth, along with proactive engagement with token projects and aggregators, underscores a commitment to long-term ecosystem development. Transparent metrics tracking and milestone setting provide clarity and accountability. With Integral's track record of building highly capital-efficient products, particularly in offering the most efficient swaps, their plan to allocate funds evenly between liquidity incentives and integration support appears sound. The proposed KPIs and milestones align well with the goals of increasing liquidity and fostering ecosystem growth on Arbitrum. Integral's focus on enabling other protocols to integrate and build on top of their platform could contribute significantly to Arbitrum's growth by offering cheaper swaps, attracting more users, and reducing friction. Overall, supporting this proposal could prove to be a mutually beneficial decision for the DAO and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\n\nIntegral presented a strong application that highlighted their recent growth, strong execution strategy, and thorough KPIs. The milestones should have been much more robust and while the grant ask is relatively large we believe given the recent growth there is value in supporting this request so we support this application. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Integral's proposal.\n\nGood proposal with very detailed justification behind grant size, and execution plan. and milestones/KPIs by week (re: LP incentives). Grant size is on the larger end in contrast to performance on Arbitrum vs. Ethereum but well justified re: capital efficiency + increased Arbitrum adoption and all in all presents a worthwhile experiment for Arbitrum to invest in scaling out.

As detailed below, we expect to see at least a 250% increase in TVL heading to Arbitrum during the lifetime of this grant.\nWe target an average of 20% APR in ARB in our pool.

The remaining 70%, however, is to rebate users fees paid to the applicant. This is hard to support for several reasons. Firstly, the applicant hasn\u2019t demonstrated that fee waivers worked to increase (and then retain) volume before asking for a large amount of funding. Secondly, rebating fees paid to the applicant, as opposed to gas or third party fees, is equivalent to governance directly giving the applicant funding. Thirdly, when fees are at or approach 100% and also are fees to the applicant, this creates a perverse incentive for the applicant to encourage wash trading, sybil farming, or steering the grant funds to rebate the highest margin trades. We recommend the applicant revise and resubmit in future grants cycles with either a different distribution mechanism or significant guard rails to address the concerns above.\n\nWintermute Feedback)\nhis application was decent and scored well across various criteria. Their execution strategy was clear however, it lacked any form of justification or calculations on how they intend to reach their milestones and KPIs.

It is the natural progression of a 6 weeks [Working Group sprint](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/start-of-arbitrum-m-a-working-group/22520/6) to develop an initial structure of the M&A unit.\n\nIn addition to conducting an in-depth strategy study on the value upside of M&A, analyzing strategic target areas, aligning them with key stakeholders (both online and at the GovHack in Brussels), and providing exemplary analyses on targets, the pilot phase should serve as a facilitated platform for in-depth discussions based on data rather than opinions.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\nThe dedicated goals of the pilot phase are the following:\n\n1. **Equip the DAO with sufficient knowledge** to make an informed decision about the operationalization of the fund.\n2. **Align the DAO on strategic target areas** by providing strategic analysis and coordinating key delegates and stakeholders.\n3. **Provide an orchestrated platform for discussion** of the efforts over an extended period of time to further sharpen the edges.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nThe pilot phase (as detailed in the proposal) will entail an 8-week sprint structured into 3 work packages and underlying deliverables below. \n\nThe insights from the analyses will be condensed into an assessment report to be presented to the DAO. Further, the GovHack at EthCC will be used for status update and facilitation of a working session.\n\n**1. Analysis of M&A value upside for Arbitrum DAO**\n**2.

More granular decisions suggested by the Execution Body (e.g., reallocating capital across providers, or allocation recommendations) have to be approved by the OAT, which has DAO representation as well as key members from OCL and the AF.\n\nAll of the council members have funding sources in place, so there will be no additional overhead related to paying these contributing entities. In terms of the remaining balance to pay the previous councils/committees (TMC & GMC) that currently sits with the AF, this will be repurposed to cover service providers\u2019 costs for specialized deliverables that the new canonical council does not possess competency to fulfil, e.g., granular risk, legal, etc. The roles of each council member are further defined below.\n\n# Rationale\nThe Arbitrum DAO now has 3 separate initiatives related to its treasury management strategy between the TMC, GMC, and the STEP committee. The TMC focuses on ARB and stablecoins, while the GMC focuses on ETH allocations, and the STEP committee focuses on RWAs. The following entities/individuals sit on councils overseeing these initiatives, with their respective pay defined below:\n\nTMC\nAustin Campbell\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nMake Markets\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nThree Sigma\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nGMC\nCallen (Formerly Wintermute)\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nLlama Risk\n$20k per milestone, total of $60k earn-able, $20k already claimed\nEntropy Advisors\nWaived Payment\nSTEP I\nCommittee (mandate completed):\nKarpatkey, GFX Labs, Steakhouse, Nethermind, North Lakes Legal, Treasury WG Lead (Devansh)\n150k ARB, 25K for each member\n50k ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation for conducting due diligence/drafting legal agreements\nProgram Manager (mandate ends in September \u201825)\nSteakhouse original allocation: 100k ARB\nFaced a shortfall due to fees being denominated in USD. $174K (total fee) - ~$87K (received from ARB liquidation) to be paid from yield earned through the program\nSTEP II\nCommittee (mandate completed)\nKarpatkey, GFX Labs, Entropy Advisors, Nethermind, North Lakes Legal, Treasury WG Lead (Devansh)\n125k ARB in total (Entropy Advisors waived payment, thus 25k ARB less than STEP 1)\nTo summarize, the DAO has ~$581,000 of overhead associated with treasury management activity, assuming an ARB price of $0.285 (realised dollar-denominated spend is higher, as ARB price has fallen since previous payments to contributors). The total AUM amongst all of these programs is approximately $50M, with the total yield earned on the underlying thus far amounting to ~$590k. The DAO has just recently broken even on its treasury management initiatives. However, it is worth noting that not all of the funds have been deployed from the TMC and GMC proposals, which are expected to accelerate passive yield inflows.\n\nEntropy Advisors has been involved in all 3 committees, and we see some areas in need of improvement. Outside of cutting down on the dollar-denominated expenses associated with running these programs in a way that only scales with the size of the programs, the sheer number of people involved in the act of treasury management without clear responsibilities is counterintuitive. It is difficult to coordinate calls across so many teams\u2019/individuals\u2019 calendars, none of the committees actually speak to one another thus resulting in a fragmented strategy for the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury, each committee usually ends up in a state where a minority of members ultimately produce a majority of the work required for execution, communication between applicants and individual committees/their members often becomes fragmented (the applicant may not know who to reach out to in order to discuss certain things relevant to the application process), etc. Additionally, all of these committee members have varying degrees of insight into things in the pipeline for the Arbitrum ecosystem, which often sets these contributors up to make misinformed decisions due to missing context.\n\nWith Timeboost officially live, the DAO treasury has again reached >7,500 ETH since the last TM v1.2 proposal passed on Tally, as well as other ongoing initiatives such as the GCP that will generate additional revenue over time, we must be able to deploy some of these assets into yield bearing strategies as they accrue to the treasury. It\u2019s time to reduce fragmentation and streamline the decision-making processes.\n\nFour open discussions on this matter were hosted on April 30, 2025, May 14, 2025, May 28, 2025, and June 11, 2025, with recordings available here, here, here, and here. We recommend watching these, and joining future calls on the topic if you have strong opinions to share.\n\n# Specifications\nIn line with the new vision laid out by the Arbitrum Foundation, we propose that Entropy Advisors serves as the \u201cTreasurer\u201d with the OAT in place to approve/deny usage of budgets allocated to treasury initiatives, with the council including two of the most aligned AAEs, the AF and OCL, as observatory members to help inform and execute on strategy. This will enable the DAO to approve high-level strategies that do not go against Arbitrum\u2019s broader strategy, considering the insight the AF and OCL will have in regards to ongoing BD efforts/opportunities as well as any operational complexities related to deploying and custodying funds. It will also reduce overhead, unify strategy, and empower Entropy to outsource specific needs to service providers with concrete deliverables on an as-needed basis, thus decreasing the principal-agent problem we face under the current structure with fragmented committees.\n\nEntropy Advisors will have the autonomy to make decisions with funds pre-approved by the DAO, but all decisions must be passed by the OAT with \u2157 approval. Any decision that does not receive \u2157 approval from the OAT will be considered denied and no funds will be allocated. This includes reallocating from one asset/strategy to another, thus giving the DAO the ability to respond to changing market conditions and to hold vendors accountable. Any/All fund movements will be accompanied with an update on the forum in order to keep the wider community informed. Again, this process only pertains to funds that have already been approved for allocation by the DAO, but the standard governance process will always be required to earmark funds for deployment. Assets already approved by the DAO for deployment (STEP I&II, TMC, GMC) will be eligible for reallocation, in accordance to the process herein, per this proposal\u2019s passing.\n\n![TM Flow 1.jpg](ipfs://bafybeietgujzicouxe2jhf3p2kmgvase2wrh6sz2d27dpin7zloin5ardq)\n\n![TM Flow 2.jpg](ipfs://bafybeie7xajd73mamx7o63cmv56lgs2cjiwbwkztc3uwx7hevvibhix4qu)\n\nThe non-exhaustive, high-level responsibilities of this council and its observers will include:\n\n**Voting Body**\n\n**Allocations Review** - OAT\n\nApprove or Deny allocation decisions presented by the Treasurer\nThe OAT will also be able to initiative emergency actions E.g., Alert the custodian to perform emergency withdrawals due to an exploit, or other emergency actions that it deems necessary to pull out capital from existing allocations\nExecution Body\n\n**Treasurer** - Entropy Advisors\n\nDAO Budget Creation\nFinancial Forecasting\nHigh-level KPI development / Data transparency through analytics\nNet Working Capital Management\nQuarterly Reporting\nStrategy Formation / Allocation Recommendations\nProtocol & Active/Passive Treasury Funds Manager Procurement\nRisk Management & Miscellaneous - Likely areas for outsourcing to SPs\n\nAdditional legal/compliance assistance beyond the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s scope (we expect the custodian, so in this case the AF, to lead this SP onboarding given their insight into what is needed beyond their in-house competency)\nDevelop and maintain a comprehensive risk framework/monitoring system for treasury allocations (e.g., liquidity, counterparty, smart contract risks, etc.)\nCoordinate stress-testing and scenario modeling for treasury assets under various market conditions\nEvaluate traditional financial assets under consideration, such as tokenized MMFs, private credit instruments, etc., and determine their viability/safety as a DAO-treasury asset\nMiscellaneous needs that may arise from time to time\nCommunications Body\n\n**DAO Orchestration** - OpCo (Entropy Advisors in the interim)\n\nResponsible for every party delivering with regard to their respective responsibility areas\nPost updates related to council votes and DAO allocations\nCreate proposals and present them to the DAO as they relate to funding requests, with direct input from the rest of the council\nContract SPs, taking in feedback from the wider council, to fulfill the work related to the \u201cGranular Risk Management & Miscellaneous\u201d functions defined below. Note that the AF will assume this responsibility until the OpCo has been operationalized.\nInform proposers whether they should be requesting to-be-monetized ARB from treasury, or stables currently deployed in strategies through coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n**Observatory Body**\n\n**Operational Execution** - Arbitrum Foundation\n\nAccounts payable/Payroll (ensure service provider payments are processed)\nARB to stable/dollar conversions\nCompliance (KYC/KYB)\nCustodian of the funds on behalf of the DAO\n**Ecosystem Support** - Offchain Labs\n\nLead institutional adoption of RWAs on Arbitrum, and help inform the wider council on ideal STEP allocations in the future based on strategic goals\nConnect the \u201cexecution body\u201d of the council with relevant app developers through their deep network of Arbitrum builders\nEnsure the \u201cexecution body\u201d is informed of any ongoing BD efforts that may conflict with allocation decisions\nThe remaining funds from the TM v1.2 proposal that were allocated to pay TMC and GMC members for their work (1M ARB) will be repurposed to this canonical treasury council to contract SPs to fulfill required duties as they arise, likely related to the \u201cRisk Management & Miscellaneous\u201d deliverables defined above.\n\nGiven that all 5 of the entities involved in the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council are DAO-funded AAEs (or in the case of OCL, project founders), it does not make sense to have a mechanism in place to remove specific members. However, it is important to ensure the DAO remains in complete control over its treasury assets. As such, any DAO contributor can disband the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council entirely by getting a proposal through Snapshot that garners 3% of the votable token supply in favor of the council\u2019s disbandment. The onus of replacing this initiative with a new structure i.e., council members, budgeting/forecasting/ reporting cadence, risk management, SP procurement, etc., will fall on the contributor that is proposing the abolishment of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council. The contributor seeking abolishment will also need to define what happens to the currently deployed assets e.g., funds pulled from strategies and returned to the treasury. We expect delegates to be cognizant of this, and to hold contributors that seek abolishment of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council to high standards in regards to the defined transition from the proposed structure herein to its proposed replacement. Also note that the responsibility of fund movement and custody can be transferred to OpCo via a DAO vote on Snapshot that garners 3% of the votable token supply in favor/abstain of the shift of responsibility.\n\n# Hypothetical Workflow Example:\n\nThe council identifies additional ETH in the DAO\u2019s treasury that is not currently being utilized and wishes to allocate these funds to begin earning additional yield. The \"DAO Orchestration\u201d member works with the \u201cTreasurer\u201d member to draft a proposal to the DAO seeking to earmark these funds for deployment, taking into account various risk factors and the current treasury composition. The AF and OCL would be charged with providing input on the draft based on compliance and deployment feasibility, as well as any upcoming strategic partnerships that could align well with a DAO deployment of capital. The general goals of the deployed capital will be loosely defined in these proposals, as to provide the treasurer with flexibility, but also to impose guardrails/ensure the capital is deployed in a manner that achieves the goals the DAO desires. Prior to the DAO Orchestration member posting this proposal to the forum, a \u2157 consensus amongst the OAT will be required.\n\nAssuming this proposal passes through the standard Arbitrum DAO governance process and the funds are transferred to the AF\u2019s control, the Treasurer would begin drafting outbound materials to conduct protocol outreach/SP procurement for fund deployment. Similar to the proposal above seeking funds from the DAO, a \u2157 consensus will be required amongst the OAT prior to any funds being deployed. Likewise, if the Treasurer wishes to reallocate funds from STEP I/II to a different provider because the initial provider did not execute on what was originally promised (e.g., failing to deploy the tokenized asset on Arbitrum One), this will require \u2157 approval from the OAT. This ensures that funds can be moved without hurting relationships with existing vendors due to the negative PR that could stem from a reallocation that currently requires a high-profile DAO vote.\n\nNote that, as always, the DAO remains in ultimate control. Any allocations made by this council can be clawed back to the DAO treasury, or be forced to be reallocated by the Execution Body, via a Snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply in favor of the clawback or forced reallocation. Also note, the OAT will be able to initiate emergency actions with \u2157 approval to pull out funds from a prior allocation, with the rationale posted to the forum immediately.\n\n# DAO\u2019s Checking Account\nIt was made evident in the recent community call, as well as on the forum, that the DAO needs to have a process for spending stables/cash during periods in which it would rather not monetize treasury ARB to cover dollar-denominated expenses, or to cover service provider shortfalls that arise due to downward ARB price volatility.\n\nMoving forward, we propose the \u201cDAOs checking account\u201d is taken over by the Arbitrum Foundation with full discretion on how it can be spent. For example, it can be used to cover service provider shortfalls or to cover dollar-denominated expenses in proposals that pass through Tally. Note, if a draft DAO proposal wants to access the funds, then it is recommended they contact the Arbitrum Foundation who will decide whether the assets can be used, before putting the DAO proposal up for a vote.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will be required to adhere to any future structures that arise, including, but not limited to, a DAO budget or Net Working Capital requirements. This requirement is only related to the DAO\u2019s treasury management initiative, and does not pertain to the AF\u2019s current operations / existing budget. The AF will be required to confer with the Treasurer (Entropy) and inform the DAO Orchestration member (OpCo once operationalized) so that financial frameworks are followed, capital movements can be accounted for, and the DAO stays informed. The Treasurer will continually evaluate Net Working Capital developments, and make proposals to the DAO accordingly to ensure short-term liabilities can be met.\n\nPlease note that after speaking with the AF on May 30th, some changes to the \u201cDAO\u2019s Checking Account\u201d section were made.\n\n# Costs\nThere will be no additional overhead related to these contributing entities, as they aren\u2019t being compensated for their services in relation to the treasury management strategy and execution under this proposal. As such, the costs associated with this proposal, excluding SP expenses required to fulfill Risk/Miscellaneous-related work, will be zero. The budget already approved to pay the GMC and TMC members is expected to cover all overhead related to needed SPs over the near-to-medium term.\n\nThere are likely to be indirect costs associated with each fund deployment (treasury management fees, tokenized RWA fees, etc), and all of these costs will be disclosed in quarterly updates from the Treasurer or in the regular updates posted by the DAO Orchestration member.\n\nNote that this proposal will only require a Snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply in favor/abstain of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council\u2019s implementation, and thus mark the wind down of the GMC, TMC, and STEP committee mandates. This is in-line with terms laid out in the treasury management v1.2 proposal.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\nThrough our proposed architecture herein, the DAO will deploy assets from its treasury with lower overhead and more accountability over each member\u2019s contributions, develop a more cohesive overall strategy, provide applicants with clear points of contact with streamlined channels for receiving proposal feedback, have comprehensive financial reporting/live monitoring, will not make any decisions without maximum context through the AF\u2019s and OCL\u2019s involvement, and will have dedicated resources to ensure risk evaluation over all treasury management initiatives in order to maximize safety over the DAO\u2019s assets.\n\nWe look forward to the community\u2019s feedback.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Although Entropy Advisors and the rest of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council will do everything possible to ensure the safety of deployed assets, crypto is experimental technology from a security and economic design perspective. Entropy Advisors, or other members of the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council, cannot be held responsible/liable for any of the risks associated with fund deployment.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "8bf9e052-e2d0-4304-9e24-375c05eb235a", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x6a578c12950f9367d2530b0324f06835bf9df5b957adcfe2bce1a240dcc09ae4", "title": "Domain Allocator Election for the Dev Tooling Domain", "author_name": "0xb29A655f3D67B2B6724Fb22B2C2303cB660c946B", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x6a578c12950f9367d2530b0324f06835bf9df5b957adcfe2bce1a240dcc09ae4", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-09-06 17:43:37", "voting_end": "2023-09-13 17:43:37", "options": {"scores": [55381871.53351163, 27239748.18773291, 590706.6340536049], "choices": ["Juandi", "Hiko", "Shlok Mange"]}, "last_activity": "2023-09-13 17:43:37", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.647", "body": "**Introduction:** This is a vote to elect the Domain Allocator for the Dev Tooling domain within the Arbitrum ecosystem grants run through the Delegated Domain Allocation model.

They have justified their grant request with a detailed execution strategy and solid KPIs. We felt like their application could have provided more detailed milestones and the distribution of the incentives is a concern as they will likely end up in the hands of a few users.

The requested ARB grant is a little on the high side given the age and activity of the protocol, however, is justified well enough.\nThey have a nice distribution mechanism that targets LPs to stay for a longer period of time through an escrow mechanism which is great. Their protocol is also rather novel and introduces some interesting opportunities for traders on Arbitrum.\nSome of their KPIs lacked a bit of justification and seemed rather arbitrary. We would\u2019ve also liked to see additional reward mechanisms that target increasing users and trading volume on the platform.\nOverall, given the grant request, novelty, and distribution mechanism, we support Limitless\u2019 application.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nLimitless presented a decent application overall. While it was difficult to verify the data from the Limitless Beta program and their milestones were not trackable at all, their incentive design is very clearly thought out and specifically promotes retention and stickiness. Additionally, the protocol is pretty novel and is a nice addition to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Overall, we believe these factors justify their grant request so we will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\n\"Vote FOR Limitless' proposal.\n\nGood proposal that scored moderately well on rubric. Grant size justification and use of funds is sufficiently incentivized and escrowed approach to lock/vest maintains liquidity post-LTIPP.

A 2-month pilot sprint of the core team focused on executing the market consultation part of the scope.\n>2. Running a series of online and IRL events before, during and after the 2 month sprint dedicated to the creation of an Arbitrum Ecosystem Investment Thesis. This thesis will help integrate the various investment initiatives already being run or proposed to the DAO.\n\n\n### Shortcast\nhttps://x.com/Sinkas_/status/1796573051414302910\n\n### Full proposal text\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-pilot-phase-arbitrum-venture-initiative/24247\n\n## Context:\nThis proposal builds upon discussions during ETHDenver, and a subsequent six weeks of conducting the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI) Working Group.\n\nAs a result of the above, the AVI Working Group has identified existing pain points related to venture development and investment frameworks, and has proceeded to submit this proposal with the intent to formulate an eventual comprehensive go-to-market strategy for the AVI.\n\n\n## Abstract:\nThe AVI team\u2019s mission is to grant the ArbitrumDAO an effective and practical knowledge base so as to equip delegates and future AVI contributors with the necessary toolkit to deploy the AVI Ecosystem Fund (or nomenclature equivalent).\n\n\n\n## Why conduct a pilot phase?\nOperating AVI represents a bold and pioneering initiative for blockchain ecosystems and as such it is also a complex undertaking that involves high capital needs. It also is one of several such initiatives the Arbitrum DAO that require complex stakeholder alignment around setting up legal and governance structures. Thus, it is not appropriate to rush before the relevant structures have been put in place. \n\nAt the same time, there is a significant opportunity cost in not progressing with good velocity on at least the components that can already clearly be acted on. A lean and pragmatic pilot phase to analyze key themes thoroughly and develop the necessary clarity, will provide us with a solid foundation to build on.\n\nA pilot phase will help us derisk the AVI initiative, provide a better understanding of the landscape and options at hand, surface and validate key assumptions, and engage and align key stakeholders. Running a pilot phase will help us refine and optimize our investment strategy to cater to investors and target developers of highest strategic significance and return potential to Arbitrum, while at the same time further fleshing out the next steps and cost assumptions. Ultimately, our goal is to foster iterative learning, robust and effective investment approach, and strong engagement from key ecosystem participants. \n\n\n## Pilot approach\nThe pilot sprint outputs intend to provide the DAO delegates and stakeholders with sufficient information to decide on advancing the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI), or parts of it into the next phase of development. The sprint is designed to fund the operational team for 8 weeks and is the natural progression of our existing Working Group efforts. We will also be hosting the IRL thesis development event and online workshops before and after the core sprint. Thus, producing an overall timeline of up to 18 weeks.\n\nThe sprint will kick off in-depth research and workshops to identify opportunity areas (thesis development).\n\nThe pilot sprint will provide concrete data and analysis from various ecosystem participants and stakeholders. Armed with this information, we will have the strategic perspective (thesis development) ready for AVI\u2019s operation.\n\n### Key Output // Deliverables\n- **Thesis Development Report:**\n  - A detailed thesis report outlining the strategic vision, objectives, and target areas for investment within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This should include:\n    - Identification of key sectors (e.g. within DeFi, Social, Consumer, DeSci, DePIN, etc) and their relevance to Arbitrum.\n    - Analysis of market trends, opportunities, and competitive landscape (while collaborating on any work done by other groups with clear overlap).\n    - Potential impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem and long-term value creation.\n    - Foundational hypothesis development on strategic relevance of key sectors and investee profiles.\n- **Market Consultation Findings:**\n  - A synthesis report from market consultations (Indicators in mind: 30 founders and 15 funds). This should cover:\n    - Insights into market perceptions and expectations.\n    - Identification of potential challenges and opportunities from the perspective of market participants.\n    - Recommendations based on feedback for refining the investment strategy.\n- **Community Engagement and Feedback:**\n  - A summary of community and stakeholder engagement activities, and feedback collected, including:\n    - Details of public events and their outcomes. \n    - Assessment of the effectiveness of alternative community engagement activities.\n    - Summary of feedback from community members and how it has been incorporated into the strategy.\n    - Plans for ongoing community engagement and transparency.\n- **Set of Strategic Recommendations:**\n  - A conclusive set of strategic recommendations for the ArbitrumDAO, encompassing:\n    - A clear roadmap for the next phases of the initiative.\n    - Analyzed specific strategic investment priorities and actionable steps for fund deployment.\n    - Substantiating the above with examples for potential deal warehousing.\n    - Metrics for evaluating the success and impact of the venture capital arm (initial version).\n- **Operational Plan and Budget:**\n  - A detailed operational plan for the next phase of the Arbitrum Venture Initiative.

Questbook is leading\u00a0[Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136)\u00a0grants program through\u00a0[delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/)\u00a0, a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by\u00a0**4**\u00a0**individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a\u00a0*domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these\u00a0*domain allocators*\u00a0will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each\u00a0*domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/)\u00a0)\u00a0**will help facilitate setting up these\u00a0*domain allocators*\u00a0and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members\n### **Rationale**\u00a0**(Benefits to Arbitrum)**\n\nThe proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:\n\n1. **Aligned allocation of funds:**\u00a0By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum\u2019s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.\n2. **Increased transparency:**\u00a0The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook\u2019s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. **Increased accountability:**\u00a0With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. **Lower**\u00a0**Turnaround Time (TAT):**\u00a0The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals\u2019 turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem.\u00a0**An example of this is Compound who\u2019s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours.**\u00a0The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.\n5. **Strong Brand Recognition**\u00a0: The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas. \n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThe program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator\u2019s performance.\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\n**Arbitrum Grants Committee**\n\nThe program will consist of\n\n1. A Program Manager\n2. 4 Domain Allocators\n\n \n![1.1.png](ipfs://bafkreicew52tsgud3subrurhrv6jud3zyep743fpgfiv4yzw54nnty423m)\n    \n\nWe propose \u00a0[Tally\u2019s Zodiac Governor Module](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/using-governor-with-gnosis-safe/zodiac-governor-module-for-subdaos-and-grants-programs)\u00a0for security purposes. Furthermore, a Grants SAFE with 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and 4 domain allocators. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/3 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.\n\nWe have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.\n\n![1.2.png](ipfs://bafkreifk7yaqw2lvwj35tx2rumagctyd3of6nd2bh3fawsiij74bmdlyv4)\n\n## Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:\n\nThe following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.\n\n1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs\n        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum\n        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders\n        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements\n        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly\n        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program\n        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls\n        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the\u00a0grants program\u00a0and progress each selected project such as:\n  \n \n![13a.png](ipfs://bafybeihd4opx3atmhvarhrd5t6edpmpyfi4m6ptblpl4siihpqip5qh2wu)\n    \n    \n\n2. Grants Program: \na. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities\nb. Sign the transactions for the approved projects\nc. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision\nd. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed and take their feedback consistently\n\n3. Domain Allocator:\n    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator\n    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network\n    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.\n\n### **Compensation:**\n\nThe grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unallocated funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.\n \n![14aaa.png](ipfs://bafybeig7zsa7e7vdk7zdnmspuq4z6ciajxorckhiy3ckpro4xfcv6ycheq)\n    \nP.S\n\n1. We are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Snapshot, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted.\n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\nObjective\n1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum\u2019s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects\n3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas\n4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)\n5. Increase in the community members\u2019 participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Arbitrum\u2019s community call\n7. Increased engagement in builder community\u2019s\nDiscourse\nDiscord, Telegram\nSocial media (Twitter, Reddit)\nGitHub\n\nSubjective\n1. Improved community involvement in the grants program\n2. Strengthened builders\u2019 sentiment towards Arbitrum\n3. Enhanced Arbitrum\u2019s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook\u2019s role in Arbitrum\u2019s Grant Program\n\n- Saurabh from Questbook will be the program manager. Thereafter, the program manager will be elected from the community.

Creating a legal and infrastructural pipeline that future diversification proposals can take guidance from and\n2. Proof of concept that we can diversify our treasury in a way that supports ecosystem growth\n\nThis is NOT a grant; it is an investment that Arbitrum governance can exercise control over and recall, subject to agreed-upon conditions with a successful applicant.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) is the first proposal floated by the Treasury WG before the DAO. We are targeting stable RWAs backed by t-bills or money market instruments as the 1st step towards larger treasury diversification for several reasons;\n1. Once we figure out how to hold stable RWAs on our books, we can easily diversify based on best practices rather than procedural considerations. The stable coins we use today in De-Fi are mostly backed by t-bill RWAs; creating our own exposure can increase capital efficiency and mitigate risk.\n2. An insight from the Arbitrum Days workshop at Istanbul was the DAO needs a strategy/program for different verticals - RWAs, gaming, NFTs, De-Fi, DeSo, DeSci, etc. Another way of looking at STEP 1 is that it\u2019s a proposal boosting the stable RWA vertical on Arbitrum, with the added advantage that it\u2019s in the form of an investment rather than a grant.\n\n    More generally, stable RWAs have an attractive risk-reward ratio for Arbitrum in terms of sectors we should be nurturing. The total US treasury market is over $20 trillion, some of which is expected to come onchain to satisfy demand from wealthy investors. As the home of De-Fi, we should not cede space to [Base](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/12/coinbase-debuts-rwa-platform-built-on-base-under-abu-dhabi-regulators-oversight/) or [Mantle](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd) that have their own RWA support program.\n\n3. Although protocols on Arbitrum and governance might wish to hold stable RWAs, they are limited by having to conduct due diligence on providers they can trust. This proposal creates a qualified screening committee that evaluates applicants and prepares a Assessment Report on them, providing a roster of vetted service providers that anyone can use for investing assets into RWAs\n\nIn conclusion, we expect that lessons learned from implementation of this proposal can pave the way for a new form of an ecosystem support program, where the ArbitrumDAO supports projects not with grants but purchases of financial products built on our chain that also diversify our treasury holdings.\n\n### Timeline and Procedure\n\n1. Snapshot temperature check and [if successful] an on-chain vote via Tally to fully implement this framework in February 2024;\n2. Screening committee publishes RFP with specific information requested from applicants and minimum criteria they must satisfy to be considered;\n3. Receive applications from service providers (30-day submission window);\n4. Screening committee reviews each application, and where needed, conduct additional due diligence and research;\n5. Assessment report on eligible service providers released by screening committee (April);\n6. ARB token holders divide their voting power among approved service providers to allocate sanctioned amount using the [Snapshot Weighted Voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types) strategy. Providers receive an allocation proportionate to their support from ARB holders, provided they clear a threshold of 10% of all eligible votes.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. The Arbitrum foundation will act as the legal entity and face the service provider during the KYC process. They shall also hold any tokens/NFTs received in exchange of investments and have authority to withdraw assets from the service provider should any risks be discovered; however an explanation for the same shall be posted on the forum within 3 days of taking such an action. They will also periodically sweep interest earned from these assets to our treasury. Fire Drills will be periodically conducted to test solvency and clear out any AML delays in returning investments\n2. Interest earned from RWAs will be swept to our treasury for increasing our bridged USDC holdings (currently at 10 cents). For reference, $20 million in t-bills currently returns roughly $1 million in annual interest. Delay of more than 60 days in returning interest earned will result in liquidation of an investment from a service provider.\n3. Proposals to utilize interest earned will follow the same process as requesting funds from the treasury\n4. The screening committee will comprise of 6 members: Karpatkey, GFX Labs Steakhouse Financial, Nethermind and North Lake Legal, & the Treasury WG acting as facilitator and tie-breaking vote\n    * Karpatkey is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We\u2019ve been working with GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW Protocol, and Lido on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions.\n    * GFX Labs is the leading provider of professional governance services in DeFi. We are most known for our extensive past and present contributions at Uniswap, MakerDAO, Compound, and Optimism. GFX focuses on operational improvements and improving organizational quality and structure, with strong relevant experience in real-world asset onboarding and stablecoins.\n    * Steakhouse Financial is the leading CFO-as-a-service consulting company for DAOs. We specialize in stablecoins and RWAs. Our team has been merging TradFi and DeFi for years \u2013 our team met as contributors to the Strategic Finance Core Unit at MakerDAO.\n\n        We\u2019ve contributed extensively to asset-liability management research and structuring MakerDAOs RWA portfolio, including its exposure to treasuries. We specialize in deep due-diligence reports of tokenized issuers and publish the leading research report and Dune dashboards covering the space https://dune.com/steakhouse/tokenized-securities\n\n    * *Nethermind* is a blockchain research and software engineering company empowering enterprises and developers worldwide to work with and build upon decentralized systems.

Nethermind is a key contributor to the development of Ethereum, with our execution client representing over a quarter of all synced nodes. Additionally, we actively build the Starknet ecosystem and support our institutional and enterprise partners in advanced blockchain, digital assets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) fields.\n    * North Lakes Legal is a law firm at the leading edge of bridging decentralized finance, DAOs and Real World Assets. North Lakes Legal implemented the standards for the initial high-profile real- world asset (\u201cRWA\u201d) financings in the DeFi space. Christian Petersen is the principal of North Lakes Legal and has 26 years of cross border project and structured finance experience. In support of Maker DAO, North Lakes Legal has structured, negotiated, and implemented the following:\n        -  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale \u2013 DAI 40 million, tokenized French covered bonds\n        - Huntingdon Valley Bank \u2013 DAI 100 million vault to acquire RWA loan participations\n        - BlockTower Credit \u2013 DAI 150 million vault utilizing Tinlake for various RWAs\n        - Monetalis Clydesdale \u2013 DAI 500 million to acquire U.S. treasury ETF\n        - Most recently, North Lakes Legal advised Ondo Finance in the development, structuring and launch of Ondo USDY.\n\n5. The Assessment Report prepared by the screening committee on eligible service providers will be used to inform delegates and ARB holders in casting their weighted snapshot vote dividing sanctioned ARB among providers. Details in the Assessment Report include schedule for returning interest, relationship with Arbitrum (debtor or custodian), maturation period of asset, legal structure (bankruptcy remote assessment), solvency, Arbitrum alignment, turnaround time for returning investment, transparency level (proof of reserves/read only access to accounts), and fees charged.\n6. 200,000 ARB for implementation of this proposal; unused funds returned to treasury\n\nAnticipated expenditures include\n* 6 month third party audit on selected providers\n* Honorarium of 500 ARB per application for each of the 6 screening committee members (NB: this * may * be supplemented with a small application fee not exceeding $1000 to prevent spam proposals;\n* Engaging external experts and due diligence specialists where relevant.\n* Full account of fund utilization will be posted on the forum. \n\n7. Eligibility: Full RFP will be created by screening committee post Snapshot approval.

The reward for the incentives was not compelling in that example, however. Also, funding support for as-yet-to-be-determined integration partners is hard to sign off on, since as reviewers, we need to know where the ARB funds will end up. Finally, Gyroscope has almost no presence on Arbitrum according to DeFi Llama, which makes a large grant request difficult to support.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nGyroscope presented a very thorough application. One that scored very well across most of the rubric. Specifically, they excelled in justifying their KPIs and objectives as it relates to expanding their E-CLPs and expanding their stablecoin integrations. The main concerns were centered around where the majority of their usage has been (Polygon and Optimism) and some lack of clarity around their milestones. Overall, we will be suppporting Gyroscope on the basis of expanding stablecoin innovation and adoption on Arbitrum for what we feel as a very reasonable grant ask.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe protocol may not have high numbers on the Arbitrum network currently, but they have demonstrated decent traction on other Layer 2 solutions. GYD stablecoin stands out by implementing a basket of assets for backing, along with automated risk diversification rules. Integration with Frax and Balancer enhances its composability with other ecosystem projects. The proposed $10 million TVL target appears reasonable given their grant ask. The team boasts a solid background, with one founder having published work on Google Scholar. Their effective use of incentives in the past, particularly with Optimism, bodes well for their ability to drive adoption. Leveraging their points system to attract more users seems like a sound strategy, although safeguards against Sybil attacks should be clarified. Overall, Gryoscope aims to introduce a decentralized stablecoin backed by various assets to the Arbitrum ecosystem. With clear KPIs and milestones, they aim to utilize the $100k grant to incentivize and bootstrap their stablecoin for adoption. If they can achieve a $10 million liquidity target, they believe they can kickstart adoption. While Arbitrum lacks decentralized stable value options, Gryoscope has the potential to fill that gap if they can gain traction. The proposal is well-written and outlines their objectives very well.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nGyroscope\u2019s application was very good, they provided very thorough details and justifications of their KPIs, milestones, goals, and objectives. They provided a clear vision of how they impact the DeFi landscape and how they will benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir product is unique and they bring some interesting infrastructure to Arbitrum. Their demonstrated ability to successfully work with previous incentives is a plus. Their requested grant size is sufficiently justified and they have a solid execution strategy, however, we would\u2019ve liked to have seen some more variety in the pool selection. Lastly, their project is highly composable and the product has demonstrated its ability to capture a significant amount of 1inch flow and transactions.\nWe will be supporting this application.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "971a4e93-24c2-4853-ac3d-9d599da93cf7", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x0d9fd9f880615a320fa1294264d317228f0479d7f7f146f5c9683f1cb27f814b", "title": "Stargate Finance STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0xF4B0556B9B6F53E00A1FDD2b0478Ce841991D8fA", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x0d9fd9f880615a320fa1294264d317228f0479d7f7f146f5c9683f1cb27f814b", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [124090222.52102174, 29037783.896476727, 3436476.5768120517], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.421", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

They presented clear KPIs, milestones, and goals, and have a decent understanding of how their product benefits the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir product has only recently begun to see substantial growth but is still slightly underwhelming given their age. Nonetheless, the protocol has a decent amount of activity and brings some novel infrastructure to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir justification of the grant size is okay but rather ambitious. Given the level of activity on their protocol, the allocated amount of weekly ARB seems high.\nThey\u2019ve incorporated some nice requirements on both the user and manager side to ensure rewards are going to more genuine users. However, we would\u2019ve liked to see some of their rewards allocated towards a PnL trading league for managers to actively push activity on the platform.\n\nGiven their alignment with Arbitrum, composability, recent growth, and novel product, we will be supporting this proposal.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nSTFX scored well across most of the rubric, mainly losing points for a large grant ask for their current usage which may lead to poor distribution.

We believe this market timing is opportune and this decision should be pushed to the DAO. We will be supporting this proposal.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR STFX's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well on rubric (protocol details, KPIs, milestones, etc). Despite launching in 2022, they have seen moderate growth with it beginning to balloon in recent times. While the grant size is high in contrast to usage and they have ambitious milestones/KPIs to hit, there are a number of product unlocks around the corner (Privy, PWA) that will help seed this on top of a potential LTIPP grant, believe it is a worthwhile use of capital from the DAO.

For a candidate who plans to self-vote, the two most important things to keep in mind are: **your self-vote is not larger than the voting power directed towards any other candidate, and your self-vote is not larger than 33% of your voting power**. Outlined below is a further explanation of how the rules apply to voters (candidates and non-candidates) in this OAT election.\n\n## Application of the Responsible Voting Policies in OAT Elections\n\nFirst, any delegate not participating in the OAT election is free to vote however they wish. If a potential conflict of interest exists, it should be disclosed on the forums before voting as outlined in the [Delegate Code of Conduct](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-dao-delegate-code-of-conduct/27761). Delegates and participating candidates who seek to abstain from the vote can do so by voting in a neutral manner, i.e, splitting the voting power equally across all candidates to effectively abstain.\n\nThe OAT election has 3 available seats to fill; therefore, a candidate is permitted to put up to 33% of their vote on themself. As a participating candidate planning to self-vote, the most straightforward way to adhere to the policy is by voting for yourself and two other candidates, each with 33%.\n\nIf for some reason, a participating candidate wishes to have more flexibility by voting for less (1 or 2) or more (4+) than the seats available (3), we encourage them to consult the policy in full, but to summarize, the candidate should make sure a) their self-vote is not larger than the voting power directed toward any other candidate and b) is less than or equal to 33%. To give a straightforward example related to a), a candidate isn\u2019t allowed to use 60% of their voting power on person A, 10% on person B, and 30% on themselves.\n\nDiscovered violations or attempts at collusion by a delegate will lead to an immediate disqualification from the application process, and the delegate\u2019s votes will be removed retroactively from the results.\n\nAs always, the Entropy team is happy to answer or consult participating candidates who may have questions about the Responsible Voting Policy. Please refer to the recently posted Arbitrum DAO [Code of Conduct](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-dao-delegate-code-of-conduct/27761) & [Arbitrum DAO Procedure](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/updates-to-the-arbitrum-daos-procedures/27762) posts in the [Guides & Documentation](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/guides-documentation/54) subcategory for the most up-to-date versions of the documents.\n\n## Candidates Eligible for the Snapshot Voting Stage\n\nFollowing the Candidate Eligibility Evaluation period led by the Arbitrum Foundation, the following applicants will be included in the Snapshot vote for OAT elections:\n\n* [A.J.

Coming from FinTech and the open banking world, it's an impressive feat with their accolades re: receiving a Swiss banking license and building this atop Arbitrum. On the grant size, it is large for what will generally support a relatively closed and less composable ecosystem and the structure of the grant is not optimal with a portion going towards affiliate partnerships. Recommend they resubmit in a later grants window with a lower amount and focus only on the referral campaigns.\"\t\t\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nWhile Fiat24 presented a strong application we are concerned about the potential for a double dipping of grant funds due to the overlap in SafePal\u2019s proposal. Both proposals presented similar execution plans by rewarding users who sign up, complete KYC, and transact. Additionally, the affiliate partner program grants will likely be going to other LTIPP applicants who use of Fiat24. Fiat24 has run a previous referral program of 19k, but the requested 490k is a big step up. Given the large ask of Fiat24, we have decided to support SafePal and its smaller request to see how this type of referral & sign up program performs over the next 3 months. Regarding their application specifically, the milestone section was lacking and additional  data on usage would\u2019ve been helpful. We encourage Fiat24 to apply again for the LTIP. \n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal presents a comprehensive overview, showcasing strong collaborations with industry giants like Visa and Mastercard. From the perspective of Real World Assets (RWA), the protocol has demonstrated decent growth, and with the proposed incentives and milestones, we anticipate significant adoption within the RWA space. The protocol's roadmap is clearly defined, with plans to expand and transition into an orbit chain, aligning well with Arbitrum's protocol goals. With all users undergoing KYC procedures, the risk of sybil attacks is mitigated, as each individual possesses a unique identity. Additionally, Fiat24 has previously proven its ability to onboard users into the RWA arena through a grant from the Arbitrum foundation. This presents a unique opportunity to blend DeFi and RWAs using the Arbitrum Stack. While the overall grant size is substantial, it has the potential to catalyze a wave of RWA users, benefiting the ecosystem as a whole. The proposed KPIs and milestones appear reasonable, and the team exhibits a commendable level of experience. Considering these factors, there is strong support for this proposal.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis grant plan, while expensive, explicitly targets onboarding new users to Abitrum and with a product that provides real utility. We recommend approving this grant. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nFiat24\u2019s application was very unique and awesome to see. They bring novel infrastructure to Arbitrum that will likely result in very sticky TVL and users. Their application was solid with decent justifications for milestones, KPIs, and goals. Their requested grant size is on the larger end however, it is in line with their onchain metrics. They provided sufficient justification and calculation of their requested grant size through the cost of customer acquisition and their execution strategy follows closely to previous incentive plans that have worked well for them.\nWe are typically hesitant to reward grants to projects with KYC barriers, however, in this case, if successful, we believe Fiat24 can significantly improve the competitive landscape of Arbitrum.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "9b740845-5308-4d97-a20a-42ca62e40faf", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xb04e968c2439cd68e429f722722944c960f82ce75d9f75efe8be52333e1d6554", "title": "ARDC Risk Member Election", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb04e968c2439cd68e429f722722944c960f82ce75d9f75efe8be52333e1d6554", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-03-05 16:06:05", "voting_end": "2024-03-12 16:06:05", "options": {"scores": [176162724.37748492, 186781.8266286507], "choices": ["Elect Chaos Labs", "Don't Elect Chaos Labs"]}, "last_activity": "2024-03-12 16:06:05", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.813", "body": "The Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills.

However, only 54% of dApps have used it last year, with only 21% being able to calculate their CAC and 0% calculating their users\u2019 LTV.\n\n[Patterns](https://patterns.build/web3-crm) proposes a 1st iteration of a program for dApps & Protocols to **help them build off & on-chain user acquisition campaigns with positive ROI**. Participants can design their campaigns freely with a requirement for all of them to be measurable and Patterns will calculate ROI (based on CAC and on-chain LTV) for all campaigns to focus on the most efficient strategies in the next iteration. \n\n## The challenge\n\n-   \ud83d\udcb8 The main goal of incentive programs such as STIP & LTIPP is to increase the user inflow into the ecosystem that will lead to higher network usage, TVL and finally - the price of $ARB.\n    \n-   \u274c Even though the budgets for these programs are increasing, their results are temporary and most metrics fall back to their baselines right after the program is finished, which is underlined by many ecosystem stakeholders.\n    \n\ud83d\udcc8 Patterns team (f.k.a. Tokenguard) analyzed projects that took part in the LTIPP program and identified multiple reasons of this and similar programs not achieving long-term results that were expected:\n\n-   No off-chain marketing - most protocols didn't communicate rewarding to new users in other ways than using existing SM channels such as Twitter and Telegram.\n    \n-   Lack of knowledge of on-chain user acquisition funnels - only 37% of protocols have off-chain tracking tools installed for marketing purposes, which makes it impossible to run successful user acquisition campaigns.\n    \n-   No consideration for ROI and over-expenditure on non-performing projects - as discussed during ARB Liquidity Incentive calls, most teams don't have any active marketing & growth teams that would take care of CAC & LTV ratios for their marketing campaigns.\n    \n\nThese insights along with the supporting data were presented at ARB Liquidity Incentives calls organised by L2Beat (thanks to Kaerste & Sinkas):\n-   09.10.2024 - [summary, recording & transcript are available here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849/70)\n-   27.11.2024 - [summary, recording & transcript are available here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849/77)\n\n**The above reasons make most incentivization programs attract only a small group of existing Arbitrum users and / or users that interact with cross-chain protocols available on Arbitrum.**\n\n## Insights from dApps & Protocols\n\nWhile working on this proposal, our team conducted surveys amongst LTIPP participants to understand their perspective on user acquisition and most efficient strategies they used. Out of 40 protocols we\u2019ve contacted, 19 filled out the survey. The results bring in some significant new conclusions:\n\n-   84% of surveyed protocols indicated covering user gas fees & airdrops as the most efficient user acquisition strategies\n--   However, 53% of protocols haven\u2019t spent a single dollar on off-chain user acquisition in 2024\n--   Out of 47% of protocols that spent $ on off-chain user acquisition in 2024, 88% indicated 2 off-chain strategies (paid posts & ads; newsletters) as the second most efficient user acquisition tool.\n  \n-   Only 21% of surveyed protocols know their CAC (\u201cCustomer acquisition costs\u201d)\n    \n-   0% of protocols know their LTV (\u201cLifetime value of a user\u201d)\n   \nFurther questions uncovered more interesting insights about user-related development plans of dApps & Protocols:\n\n-   Even though 84% of surveyed protocols mentioned covering gas fees & airdrops as the most efficient user acquisition strategies, only 37% of protocols are aware of or have plans to implement ERC-4337 standard (Account Abstraction standard allowing to easily onboard users and cover their gas fees).\n    \n-   Only 37% of dApps & Protocols have some kind of off-chain tracker installed - which is a crucial prerequisite for running successful user acquisition campaigns and calculating CAC & LTV\n    \n-   As many as 68% of surveyed dApps & Protocols mentioned metrics other than TVL as the most important for them.\n    \n\n## The solution\n\nPatterns would like to propose an iterative program, complimentary to [the one proposed by IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/3), that would solve these challenges by helping protocols run and measure their off & on-chain user acquisition campaigns. The aim of the program is for protocols & ecosystem to learn how to run these campaigns successfully and build a culture of web3 user acquisition through measurable marketing that finally allows to calculate the LTV / CAC and ROI.\n\n  \n\n**Duration**: 3 months per iteration + 2 weeks application time\n\n**Budget** (first iteration):  \n-   3,000,000 $USD / 10,263,158 $ARB (at $0.38 7-day avg + 30% reserve for price change)\n-   All unused funds returned to the DAO.\n\n**Scope**: Patterns will run a program to boost user acquisition by dApps & Protocols into the $ARB ecosystem. All projects will be divided into categories, based on the ecosystem user acquisition funnel:\n![enter image description here](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6645e490e589077daad8a58e/67c0904f5027d40473b885d6_2-Ecosystem-User-Acquisition.png)\nBudget will be spent on helping these projects achieve predefined measurable goals through all the steps of the above user acquisition funnel:\n\n-   Off & on-chain performance campaigns - consisting of measurable ad campaigns in networks such as Twitter, Linkedin and on-chain networks such as Hypelab and Slise; Paid content and landing page creation; Paid newsletters and cold outreach; Setting up off-chain tracking tools.\n    \n-   On-chain incentivisation - including gas fee coverage, rewards and long-term on-chain incentives; Setting up Account Abstraction infrastructure to make Arbitrum products user-friendly and easily acquire new users.\n\n**Program KPIs:** Each category will have a different set of on-chain KPIs connected to its role in the Arbitrum Ecosystem according to the user acquisition funnel:\n\n* Bridges, On-Ramps & Wallets (up to 5 projects) - the only purpose of bridging & on-ramp projects is to bring in as much funds into the ARB ecosystem as possible and make them as hard as possible to move out. This strategy has worked really well in LTIPP projects and should be continued.\n* DeFi (up to 10 projects) - this segment is characterized by high to medium value transactions and wallets. It's main purpose is to generate as many high volume trades as possible to keep users' capital engaged in the ecosystem for as long as possible. Additionally, offering assets available only on ARB would be highly appreciated.\n* Others (up to 5 projects) - this segment includes all non-financial products within the Arbitrum Ecosystem - such as NFT Publishers & Marketplaces, Games, Social Platforms, AI Platforms and others. All of them are characterized by low value transactions and require high user stickiness to be sustainable. From ecosystem perspective, incentivizing these projects can be beneficial only if users stick with them for long, making their lifetime number of transactions high enough to generate sequencer fees.\n    \n  \n|  | Goals | KPIs (every 1 month) | Retention KPIs (after 3 months) |\n|--|--|--|--|\n|Bridges, On-Ramps & Wallets| - Maximize inflow of new funds into $ARB ecosystem; - Minimize outflow of funds out of $ARB ecosystem| - Net inflow balance; -Net inflow volume| - % change in inflow balance; - % change in inflow volume\n|DeFi| - Maximize number & value of trades; - Increase TVL & trade volume on assets available only in $ARB| - Number of trades; - Volume of trades; - TVL| - % change in number of trades; - % change in volume; - % change in TVL|\n|Others (NFT, Gaming, Social, AI)| - Maximizing stickiness; - Maximizing in-product purchase| - Monthly Active Purchasing Users; - Avg. in-product purchase volume per wallet| - % change in Monthly Active Purchasing Users; - % change in purchase volume per wallet|\n\n![enter image description here](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6645e490e589077daad8a58e/67c0904e6a3a411ae6553e15_acef07d01323d6839013df17f22a878b_3-dApp-DeFi-User-Acquisition.png)\n  \n**Application process**:\n1. Arbitrum dApps & Protocols apply to the program by filling out a predefined form, where they specify:\n  1.1. KPIs they declare to achieve every 1 month as well as Retention KPIs after the campaign.\n  1.2. Requested budget with expected items & costs\n  1.3. Tools used for running and off-chain measurement of the campaign * All activities **must be measurable** and Patterns will receive access to tools used (eg. Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Meta Ads, etc.). If activities include KOLs, paid content creation, SEO - all of these need to be fully measurable.\n2. After all applications are collected, the Committee assesses all applications and chooses projects at its own discretion based on the following factors:\n  1.1. KPI to budget ratio\n  1.2. Existing track record\n  1.3. Size of the project * The goal of the program is to both set up a successful campaign examples coming from the most experienced teams, as well as, amplify marketing efforts of smaller and promising projects.\n3. Depending on the type of campaigns, projects will either receive a prepayment for the upcoming month of campaigns or will be reimbursed afterwards. The Committee decides about the payment type.\n4. User acquisition campaigns start and are independently ran by dApp & Protocols teams.\n5. Committee monitors and optimizes campaigns, delivering on-chain reports & insights about users acquired. Patterns delivers **LTV value of wallets.**\n6. After every month campaign results are compared to initially declared KPIs levels.\n7. Prepayments or reimbursements for the next month of campaign operation are paid out based on the level of achieved KPIs.\n8. Unused funds are returned to Arbitrum Treasury.\n9. Insights & takeaways are collected and if results are satisfactory for the Arbitrum Foundation, the program runs with a second iteration.\n    \n![enter image description here](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6645e490e589077daad8a58e/67c0904da1b1daeadfd0051c_4-Program-framework.jpg)\n\n**DAO Reporting:**\nProject's results will be measured for each campaign separately and for the program as a whole.

To ensure the highest level of security, we propose implementing an RFP structure for smart contract security auditors. This proposal aims to establish a process for onboarding security service providers and then selecting them on a per-project basis in a transparent, fair, and efficient manner. The process will be open to all security engineers, researchers, and organizations.\n\n## Proposal\nThe Arbitrum DAO shall issue an RFP for security services. The RFP will outline the requirements for security professionals, including their experience, qualifications, and methodology. The RFP will also specify the scope of the security services needed, the timeline, and the compensation rates for various project categories. [RFP Details TBD]\n\n## Selection Process\nThe selection process will be based on the following criteria:\n\nExperience and Qualifications: Security researchers must have a proven track record of conducting smart contract security audits and/or tooling development. They must have experience with the Arbitrum ecosystem and be familiar with its unique features.\n\nMethodology: Security researchers must have a rigorous audit and tooling SDLC methodology. They must be able to identify vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation.\n\nPrice: Auditors must provide a competitive price for their services. [Standarized Metrics for rates TBD]\n\nThe selection process will be overseen by a committee of experts appointed by the Arbitrum DAO. The committee will review the proposals submitted by auditors and select the most qualified candidate based on the abovementioned criteria.\n\n## A Call to Action\nImplementing an RFP structure for security services will ensure the Arbitrum ecosystem remains secure and resilient. By establishing a transparent and fair service provider onboarding and project selection process, we can attract the best professionals and ensure they are compensated fairly for their services. We urge the Arbitrum DAO to consider this proposal and participate in the conversation, as the current state of the proposals is unmanageable, rushed, and exclusive.\n\n### Voting\nFor: Yes, invite security orgs to collaborate with the DAO on a RFP.\nAgainst: No, each security org should create its own proposal.\n\nPlease join the discussion on the [Arbitrum Forums](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-consolidate-security-proposals-into-a-rfp-process/19328)", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "9e1d5dce-b88f-4f97-a8fa-bbd8db0e6ef3", "proposal_id": "6c4e2f12-a2f8-4ed4-b0ed-c19cff5c3b3a", "snapshot_id": "0x8298874cdf0e0a1849cc02eefd3bc7d94c6868c560774df963318a5edd39a53f", "title": "OpCo \u2013 A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution", "author_name": "0xb4c064f466931B8d0F637654c916E3F203c46f13", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8298874cdf0e0a1849cc02eefd3bc7d94c6868c560774df963318a5edd39a53f", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-12-12 21:27:48", "voting_end": "2024-12-19 21:27:48", "options": {"scores": [129913798.55474308, 4744089.248446496, 26725580.24775615], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-12-19 21:27:48", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.512", "body": "# Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal builds on the ideas and concepts introduced by [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) in the initial [Operation Company (OpCo) proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737). The OpCo is a legal entity that delegates and key stakeholders can leverage to achieve DAO-defined goals, principally by forming an operational mesh layer and assigning internal employees or negotiating and entering into agreements with service providers and individual contributors to facilitate initiatives. OpCo\u2019s mission is to negate identified frictions affecting the DAO\u2019s strategy execution, such as allowing for the establishment of more operational roles for the DAO, facilitating efficient and competitive contributor and service provider negotiations and information flow between these parties, creating clear responsibilities for carrying out initiatives, and helping ensure the continuation of programs the DAO depends upon. OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes a potential advancement that could be made within its mandated focus areas, it can work on and propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nAs it currently stands, the Arbitrum DAO is generally unable to move swiftly when it requires specialized contributors to execute a strategy, for which there isn\u2019t a straightforward and low-friction approach, with these processes typically requiring a vast amount of effort from the supply side instead of being driven by the demand side. Moreover, many initiatives, especially more complex and wider-reaching ones, lack clear owners in charge of ensuring a holistic approach to execution and initiatives\u2019 continuation, meaning that in the unfortunate case that a service provider decides/is forced to disengage from its duties, there aren\u2019t always accountable individuals or entities that would push the initiatives forward. OpCo\u2019s goal is to function as the entity the DAO can leverage to remedy these limitations and move forward in areas that require a more structured approach.\n\nTo cover OpCo\u2019s operating expenses over the first 30 months, including full-time staff appointed internally, setup and other admin costs, as well as the DAO-adjacent entity\u2019s oversight committee, this proposal suggests earmarking 22M ARB (subject to change in either direction if market conditions change notably between the Snapshot and Tally votes) for the initiative:\n\n* 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo\u2019s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees\u2019 payouts additionally being performance-based.\n* Of the remaining 18M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB\u2019s current price of $1, this would require roughly 12M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following the proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact.\n* After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 22M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\n![ARB Liquidation.png](ipfs://bafybeifs75ocgefcebce7mgv5spdjfubengcta7ua6nz5rbrlbprbbtxvq)\n\nOpCo will be able to utilize the $12M in cash equivalents as follows:\n\n* $2.5M worth of stable assets released upfront.\n* Once OpCo has officially operationalized, the entity can draw up to $500K of cash equivalents each month.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nPresently, most DAO programs operate in silos, leading to, among other things, redundant efforts and non-existing cross-initiative resources. The DAO also generally depends on a single initiative leader for the continuation of a successful program, while some initiatives don\u2019t even have clear owners, which adds significant friction to strategy execution. DAOs are also inherently disadvantaged when evaluating and swiftly engaging individual contributors or service providers, and Arbitrum is no exception. This proposal aims to provide the DAO with the capabilities to nullify the abovementioned frictions by creating a DAO-adjacent legal entity\u2014OpCo. Among other things, the DAO may choose to leverage OpCo to manage:\n\n* Operational support & project planning,\n* Project management of DAO initiatives,\n* Negotiations with service providers,\n* Allocation of resources across contributors & DAO-approved projects\n\nOpCo will grant the Arbitrum DAO better capabilities to bootstrap initiatives and secure the continuation and execution of them, while also expanding the total addressable contributor and service provider base as certain sensitive negotiations and deal terms don\u2019t necessarily have to be disclosed publicly. Moreover, the DAO-adjacent entity will function as the operational mesh layer for individual contributors and service providers, streamlining communications and knowledge sharing across engaged entities and individuals.\n\nOverall, the DAO\u2019s past, current, and likely upcoming initiatives can be divided into 5 high-level categories: Governance Frameworks, Financial Management, Investments, Ecosystem Support, and Grants. The initiatives, their respective owners, and into which of the 5 categories they fall are visualized below.\n\n![Current Initiatives.png](ipfs://bafybeidaponefn7ospa42xhhtdhcw2v33to5yvrskyrvcxbmtagwwl24ru)\n\nIt is of utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO maintains a decentralized and bottoms-up system for bootstrapping new projects, DAO contributors, and setting strategies, including creating and steering the DAO\u2019s vision, mission, and purpose, as well as approaches to achieve the goals and decision-making. As such, OpCo will be focused on the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management initiative categories, but note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category if the DAO so chooses through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d).\n\nThe entity\u2019s main focus is to increase the efficiency of strategy execution through operational optimization and, in particular, activating and recruiting the optimal stakeholders, contributors, and service providers. For the avoidance of doubt, the DAO would always have ultimate authority over OpCo, with the entity purely being a helpful resource focused on streamlining wider-reaching and complex initiatives that require a more structured execution framework as well as helping push the DAO forward within areas where the entity identifies shortcomings. We want to stress the importance of ensuring that one of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s key differentiators\u2014enabling new participants to join the ecosystem and make an impact, growing into well-established contributors\u2014is conserved. Without Arbitrum DAO empowering its contributors and delegates, the DAO might sacrifice one of its core strengths, and we believe that entities such as SEEDGov, Entropy Advisors, Tally, etc., are present within the ecosystem exactly because of this empowerment.\n\nArbitrum has one of the most active and engaged DAOs within the industry, combined with help from the Arbitrum Foundation and robust programs for bootstrapping and fostering growth within the ecosystem. Although there is always room for improvement, these factors have enabled the DAO to allocate grants with positive results, sustaining a vibrant and welcoming ecosystem. Having said that, if the DAO wishes to, it can expand OpCo\u2019s mandate to include grants in the future through a Snapshot vote. When it comes to investments from treasury funds, the GCP has been established to facilitate capital allocation into the gaming sector, while the AVI is currently working on setting up a structure allowing the DAO to make venture bets across other verticals, which is why OpCo will be excluded from operating within the investments category. As alluded to earlier, we also feel as though it\u2019s crucial that the facilitation and implementation of governance frameworks continue being driven by decentralized actors, but the DAO could again expand OpCo\u2019s operations into this initiative category if it so wishes.\n\nWith that said, certain clear inefficiencies have been identified with respect to the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories. This is likely due to the operational frameworks enabling execution for these categories still being somewhat underexplored areas. As such, there is a lack of ownership, and the DAO has no structured way to frictionlessly operationalize contributors to push complex challenges forward within these verticals, often requiring a vast amount of Arbitrum DAO-specific knowledge and even lobbying efforts from the supply side instead of the demand side. Due to the current structure, active governance participants are generally purely incentivized to prioritize strategies that they are fit to solve. This has left certain critical domains unattended and reflects the need for an entity that could be mandated to help define the root causes of execution obstacles and provide solutions to remedy them.\n\nThe aforementioned inefficiencies are naturally amplified by the fact that the number of potential contributors is often restricted due to many initiatives requiring deep specialization. Finding the facilitators capable of managing initiatives end-to-end within these categories can be difficult. Oftentimes, the contributor and owner roles for initiatives are separated or there is not a clear owner at all, meaning that no one party is responsible for the continuation of these initiatives. For initiatives where the contributor and owner roles are the same or there is a clearly defined owner, the DAO generally relies on a single party for the continuation of the initiative. If the service provider or contributor, for any reason, decides or is forced to exit the ecosystem, there is not a well-defined framework for the initiative to be moved to a new owner.\n\nAs initiated, OpCo\u2019s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates. However, OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developments could be made, it can propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nTypically, the current protocol for the execution of strategies and new initiatives within the DAO\u2019s two aforementioned focus areas is as follows: (i) either the proposer defines the strategic approach and goals for the initiative or a working group is created that aims to outline these specifics such that a proposal can be created, with the working group also sometimes facilitating some or all of the work required for the execution of the strategy; (ii) if not done by the working group, the proposer or proposer-connected party is contracted to facilitate the strategy or the DAO runs some type of a procurement/election process to decide the service providers or contributors; (iii) once the work has been performed and the facilitators\u2019 term ends, a continuation proposal is created if the initiative has a clear owner. Otherwise, individual DAO contributors are required to take charge of the initiative and push it forward.\n\nIf OpCo were to be created, it would primarily be leveraged to assume responsibility for phases (ii) and (iii). I.e., the DAO defines strategies or simply strategic goals. If a clear executor to reach the key objectives exists within the DAO, they could be chosen as a facilitator and would be contracted by the OpCo. If not, OpCo could be mandated to execute these strategies by either assigning existing internal employees, hiring new internal resources, or contracting outside service providers/individual contributors to perform the required undertakings. However, if the DAO isn\u2019t proactively defining strategies/strategic goals, OpCo is required to be active within this area as well, given it has the bandwidth to do so, with these OpCo-created strategies then ratified by the DAO through the regular voting process.\n\nOpCo would have full discretion over hiring internal employees, while anyone interested in facilitating a DAO initiative could propose themselves (or another party) for that. Such a proposal must include a capital allocation to cover the facilitator\u2019s expenses since OpCo\u2019s budget only covers internal employees\u2019 salaries. If approved through governance, the facilitator would then be contracted by OpCo as a service provider for the DAO. Depending on what is viewed as the most efficient approach, OpCo will have the ability to negotiate and run procurement processes both privately and publicly, which will further strengthen the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s ability to attract and retain top talent, with all information that can be shared with the wider DAO being made available through oversight and financial reports. The below slide depicts OpCo\u2019s initial focus categories, but please note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category.\n\n![Future Structure.png](ipfs://bafybeiewjs6bgbqbbnrswbtdxkd2f2wr6b2ymjatwwu26ojtufsxfy3u5m)\n\nIf a DAO-ratified strategy or strategic goal that the OpCo is mandated to facilitate doesn\u2019t have a specific end date, the DAO-adjacent entity would continue executing until the entity feels as though the associated goals have been reached or the DAO instructs the entity to stop executing by passing a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d). If the work is expected to be long-term in nature, OpCo would be responsible for ensuring that it can be continued by accounting for associated costs in its budget extension request.\n\nFor example, delegates could define a high-level events strategy by deciding the number of events the Arbitrum DAO should be represented at in 2025, whether the strategy facilitator is the proposer, a proposer-related party, an OpCo internal employee, or someone who is chosen through a procurement process, and approving the strategy\u2019s costs that are not covered by OpCo\u2019s budget (i.e., salaries if the facilitators are not full-time staff appointed internally, booking event venues, catering, etc.) through the typical governance process, after which OpCo plans the exact events to participate in, contracts the required service providers or operationalizes internal employees, and manages all involved stakeholders and other related aspects throughout the process.\n\nService providers and individual contributors that are currently contracted, or will likely be in the near future, with the Arbitrum Foundation and fall within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories, such as SEEDGov in its role as the Delegate Incentive Program Manager, MSS members, firms forming the ADPC, Entropy Advisors, etc., should collaborate closely with OpCo once its operations are fully established and stabilized. Once fully operational, OpCo will have the capacity to project manage and oversee these initiatives according to its complete mandate. The long-term vision for this process is as follows:\n\n1. OpCo\u2019s core team is hired, and operations begin;\n2. OpCo demonstrates product-market fit (i.e., the DAO is satisfied with the entity\u2019s output) and that it has adequate processes, capabilities, and any other relevant functions to execute according to its complete mandate;\n3. OpCo is prepared to oversee full-time DAO operations, assuming existing contributor contracts through novation and managing new initiatives on behalf of the DAO (e.g., by ensuring that appropriate KYC measures and documentation are implemented).\n\nIn the case that an integral facilitator within the Ecosystem Support or Financial Management categories (or any other category OpCo might be mandated to operate within in the future) exits the ecosystem for any reason and an initiative is left without an owner, the DAO could likewise mandate OpCo to find a replacement solution.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm). OpCo internal full-time employees cannot be contributors to DAO initiatives as individuals (they need to do so through OpCo) and are strictly prohibited from entering into employment engagements with other DAOs, organizations, entities, or comparable affiliations, whilst contractors that facilitate a specific vertical and are signed to OpCo can have engagements in other DAO initiatives and outside of the ecosystem. Full-time OpCo staff can only be appointed internally. However, as mentioned earlier, the DAO can roll any service provider or individual contributor into OpCo by passing an onchain vote. This vote has to request capital to cover the facilitators\u2019 expenses since when it comes to salaries, OpCo\u2019s budget only covers internal full-time staff. OpCo is expected to work closely with Offchain Labs as well as the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that scopes of work do not overlap.\n\nIndividual contributors, service providers, and other analogous entities are naturally free to go directly to the DAO to propose they facilitate a workstream and get paid for it without facilitation by the OpCo. However, if the proposed scope of work falls within OpCo\u2019s mandate, it is expected that delegates vote against such a proposal if it can be better executed via OpCo\u2019s involvement. Proposers will be encouraged to engage with OpCo before posting a proposal to the forum to align with the DAO-adjacent entity\u2019s internal employees. OpCo\u2019s internal employees will also proactively communicate with proposal authors and facilitators outside of OpCo such that there is no overlap between deliverables and the future plans for all initiatives are clear.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s crucial to mention that the introduction of a DAO-adjacent legal entity carries risks and burdens that shouldn\u2019t be ignored. Among other things, it requires some trust in a select group of facilitators as they are responsible for hiring and procuring the correct contributors as well as operationalizing and managing the DAO-adjacent entity, OpCo\u2019s setup and fixed costs are quite notable, and some amount of administrative work is required that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have arisen.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## OpCo Operational Process\n\nWe expect the general workflow for OpCo to be as follows:\n\n* A forum discussion is initiated, with the owner of that discussion having communicated with OpCo and defined whether the covered subject falls within OpCo\u2019s initial mandate, i.e., the Financial Management or Ecosystem Support verticals.\n* For verticals that are included in OpCo\u2019s mandate, a discussion could broadly take one of the following forms:\n  * A new key objective is introduced, but the roadmap to achieve that objective is unclear: Delegates have the option to create a Snapshot proposal to direct OpCo to produce an onchain proposal that defines the strategy to achieve the key objective(s), whether the entity would procure a facilitator or hire/operationalize an internal employee, as well as any funds needed to cover the strategy\u2019s expenses, excluding OpCo\u2019s internal employee costs. If approved, OpCo would begin facilitating the proposal created by itself. It\u2019s important to note that OpCo, together with its oversight committee (OAT), is responsible for keeping the DAO informed about the entity\u2019s bandwidth. They\u2019ll also provide updates on when current projects are expected to end. This ensures that if there is a sudden spike in new proposals, especially complex and more time-intensive ones, delegates can prioritize and vote on the ones OpCo can take on.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, but the incentive program\u2019s structure and size are unclear. A proposal is passed for OpCo to operationalize internal employees and create the exact strategy. OpCo then defines, e.g., the amount of incentives to be distributed, what the application process to receive incentives looks like, how success will be measured, etc. A proposal to ratify the strategy, the incentives to be distributed, and the required workforce is then created. If passed, OpCo will activate the needed facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) and strategy execution begins.\n  * A new key objective is introduced and the roadmap to achieve that objective is clear: Delegates approve an onchain proposal that defines the strategy, whether the facilitator is the proposer, proposer-related party, an internal OpCo employee, or someone the OpCo procures, and the related expenses excluding facilitator fees for internal OpCo employees, after which strategy execution begins. If a proposal introduces a new key objective with a clear roadmap but that roadmap is ambitious, the OAT together with OpCo should signal how feasible it is for the entity to execute the proposal. If it\u2019s determined that such a roadmap is feasible, the OAT together with OpCo would also communicate whether or not the entity needs more internal resources to be able to execute.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, and the structure and size are clear. An onchain proposal to ratify the strategy, the facilitators, and the capital needed is then created. If passed, the required facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) are contracted by OpCo, or OpCo operationalizes/hires internal employees, depending on the DAO\u2019s decision, and the strategy is activated.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n* Proposals and their execution can still be DAO-led end-to-end and outside of OpCo if delegates vote in this regard. OpCo is a tool for the DAO to leverage if needed.\n* The DAO-adjacent entity is required to be proactive, meaning that internal employees need to actively give feedback in the forums and participate in opinionated discussions.\n* Furthermore, if OpCo has available bandwidth, it should identify areas within its mandated verticals where improvements could be made. If there is no clear owner for such areas and addressing them would benefit the DAO, OpCo should take action. OpCo can create a proposal to define the strategy for addressing the targeted area, requesting funds to cover expenses, excluding costs for OpCo\u2019s internal employees and other related operating expenses, and authorizing the DAO-adjacent entity to operationalize facilitators to execute the strategy.\n\nOpCo\u2019s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity\u2019s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo\u2019s oversight committee. After OpCo\u2019s core team has been hired, the entity has demonstrated product-market fit and readiness to execute according to its complete mandate, OpCo could be leveraged to help develop a DAO-wide budget, in which case the DAO-adjacent entity could hold the budgeted capital for at least the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management categories. In this case, when proposals related to these verticals are passed, no capital would have to be moved from the treasury as OpCo would be able to cover all expenses from its holdings.\n\n## Establishing OpCo\n\nExploratory work on OpCo\u2019s legal structure has already been initiated, but further effort and consultation with key stakeholders, delegates, legal parties, and the Arbitrum Foundation are needed to hammer down the exact structure. Any costs incurred by the Foundation for setting up the legal structure would be reimbursed from capital allocated to this initiative if this proposal were to pass.\n\nOpCo\u2019s initial term will tentatively be 30 months (around 6 months for setup and 24 months for operations from the entity\u2019s official initiation date). The initial term\u2019s length has been chosen to allow ample time for any unforeseen delays in establishing the legal entity, ramping up and stabilizing its operations, and will enable OpCo to focus on more complex and long-term strategies and internalize top talent as a longer initial term provides predictability/job security for employees. Once the first term is coming to an end, the executive-equivalent internal personnel together with OpCo\u2019s oversight committee\u2014the Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT), introduced below\u2014are required to collaborate to create the continuation proposal for the DAO-adjacent entity. This is expected to cover, among other things, the second OpCo term\u2019s length, the required budget, and any changes or improvements that should be made. It should be noted that if OpCo is required to internalize a vast amount of facilitator roles before a DAO-wide budget is put in place, OpCo might have to create a proposal that would allocate additional funds as its initial exemplary budget has been constructed to cover up to 12 internal full-time employees at different salaries.\n\nTo enable OpCo to successfully fulfill its mandate, the entity should, among other things, have the following initial operational capabilities, internal employees, and resources:\n\n* Internal Finances, Financial Rails, and Controls\n  * Appoint an external accounting and audit firm to maintain financial records and create yearly audits of financial statements and internal controls.\n  * Banking capabilities to be able to convert stablecoins into fiat currency and pay service providers not accepting tokens.\n* Legal\n  * Hire a full-time, in-house legal counsel.\n  * Obtain the required insurances that cover the DAO-adjacent entity as well as internal employees and the OAT.\n* Business-Critical Software\n  * Acquire any needed collaboration and communication tools, accounting and financial management software, human resources management systems, etc.\n* Internal Executive-Equivalent Employees\n  * Chief Chaos Coordinator\n    * Ensures that OpCo has the required internal resources, employees, and contracted service providers such that the DAO-adjacent entity can operate properly and execute strategies mandated by the DAO.\n    * Responsible for building and advancing the entity\u2019s operational structure and managing workflows as initiatives are rolled into the organization and new focus areas are introduced.\n    * Similarly to other executive-equivalent personnel, accountable for adequate record keeping and internal controls.\n    * Collaborates with any other executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT to produce bi-annual oversight and financial reports.\n    * Together with executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT, in charge of creating the continuation proposal for OpCo\u2019s next term.\n  * Chief of Coins\n    * Works with the relevant parties to produce a detailed, actual budget for OpCo, ratified by the OAT and the DAO. In the future, we expect the Chief of Coins to help facilitate a DAO-wide budget together with the relevant parties.\n    * Before a DAO-wide budget is created, responsible for requesting additional funds to ensure the entity\u2019s operations if capital allocated for OpCo\u2019s OpEx is close to being depleted.\n    * Verifies that allocated funds are custodied in a secure manner and utilized as intended.\n    * Makes sure that the OAT and the DAO have required visibility into ongoing expenses, how financials are expected to develop, and any other relevant considerations.\n    * Monitors Arbitrum\u2019s financial performance and makes new recommendations based on this information.\n    * Closely collaborates with entities and individuals responsible for treasury management-related tasks, enabling the creation of a unified asset allocation and risk diversification strategy in line with the DAO\u2019s vision, mission, and purpose.\n    * Manages accounting, payroll, and payment infrastructure.\n\n## OpCo KPIs\n\nWe are looking for community feedback on this front, but some potential, apparent KPIs for OpCo (h/t [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) for most of these) include:\n\n* Talent Acquisition, Service Provider Selection, and Program Management\n  * Decrease in time-to-hire, compared to the DAO\u2019s previous structure\n  * Employee engagement and satisfaction\n  * Retention rate\n  * Share of service providers meeting or exceeding performance metrics\n  * Cost savings or added value generated\n  * Diversity of service providers engaged\n* Ecosystem Coordination\n  * Time to solve open questions and other ambiguities\n  * Number of initiatives facilitated and their success\n  * Level of community engagement and stakeholder satisfaction\n  * Agility in adapting objectives\n  * Share of OpCo-initiated strategies accepted by the DAO\n* Performance Tracking and Transparency\n  * Timeliness of oversight and financial reports\n  * Share of data and metrics made publicly available\n  * Community engagement with reports\n\nUltimately, the OAT will be responsible for designing, finalizing, and implementing the relevant KPIs once OpCo is at a point where this can be sufficiently done. We envision that this will be a collaborative effort between the OAT and the DAO, with KPIs reviewed and adjusted periodically based on how OpCo evolves and the community\u2019s feedback.\n\n## OpCo Accountability \u2013 The Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT)\n\nThe OAT is a group of five individuals with the primary mandate to oversee OpCo\u2019s operations, ensure the DAO maintains transparency into the DAO-adjacent entity, function as the coordinator between the DAO and OpCo, and establish clear communication channels with the other committees overseeing the separate DAO-adjacent entities such as the GCP and possibly the CapCo in the future should the DAO vote accordingly. More specifically, the OAT\u2019s responsibilities include but are not limited to:\n\n* Accountability: Ensures that OpCo is not overstepping its mandate, over-hiring doesn\u2019t take place, and execution is constrained solely to strategies approved by the DAO. Holds the executive-equivalent personnel accountable, helps produce and approves bi-annual oversight and financial reports, designs relevant KPIs for OpCo once the entity is at a point where this can be sufficiently done, and gives other quarterly updates to the community (such as how OpCo is progressing towards the KPIs designed by the OAT, any operational developments, etc.), reviews all relevant internal materials, and monitors that funds held in OpCo-related wallets are used correctly.\n* Operational Support: Provides assistance in the entity\u2019s legal setup process, gives guidance on OpCo\u2019s operational development, assists the executive-equivalent personnel in producing a continuation proposal for OpCo, and continuously guides OpCo-related contributors to align with the DAO\u2019s will.\n* Hiring, Termination, & Authorization: The OAT, in collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, would hire the executive-equivalent personnel to the OpCo (the Chief Chaos Coordinator, the Chief of Coins, and any other positions of equivalent responsibility that may be introduced in the future) once the legal entity is established. The OAT will help onboard the executive-equivalent personnel and assist in the creation of a standardized onboarding process for future internal employees such that new hires\u2019 expectations are managed properly. Once the first internal employees are hired, the OAT would act as the approving authority when OpCo enters into contracts with service providers or individual contributors, as well as greenlight salaries, larger spends, expenses, and budgets, having the authority to challenge decisions made within OpCo that may have a material, negative impact. Moreover, the OAT would be empowered to terminate service provider/individual contributor/etc. contracts as well as fire OpCo\u2019s internal staff. If the OAT decides to take such an action, the concerned party will be suspended from their duties, and payments will be halted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Removal of OAT Members: OAT Members may be removed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a violation of a conflict of interest or other OpCo policies. In the event of a violation: (A) an OAT Member may call up an internal vote for removal with a memo detailing the alleged violation; (B) for a vote to remove an OAT Member to pass, it must have at least 4 out of the 5 OAT Members voting in favor; and (C) the ArbitrumDAO may also call for a vote to remove OAT Members at any time pursuant to a Temperature Check vote in accordance with the quorum and voting threshold requirements of a Temperature Check. The OpCo Team has the ability to call for a Temperature Check vote to remove an OAT Member as voted upon by the ArbitrumDAO. (i) The OpCo Team member may flag to another OpCo Team member that an election to remove an OAT Member via a Temperature Check vote is warranted; (ii) If such other OpCo Team member considers the request for removal to be warranted, then the OpCo Team member who originally made the flag may call for a removal election (subject to a 3 day feedback period, followed by a 7 day voting period) as a Temperature Check vote; (iii) In the event that a call to remove fails, the OpCo Team member who called for such Temperature Check vote cannot call another vote for removal for a period of 3 months. The process for electing a replacement for a removed OAT member will be equivalent to how the removed member was elected. I.e., if the removed member was elected through a DAO vote, the replacement member will be elected through a DAO vote. If the removed member was elected by the OAT, the OAT will elect the replacement member. A removed OAT member cannot be reappointed to the OAT. Further details on the OAT election process are given below.\n* Coordination: Actively engage with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to align on deliverables and serve as the liaison between delegates, key stakeholders, the wider DAO, and other DAO-adjacent entities\u2019 oversight committees. The OAT will also initiate a monthly OpCo oversight call for community members to get updates on the most recent developments and for them to have the opportunity to make inquiries. A separate forum section will be created for OpCo.\n\n## OAT Election Process\n\nIf this proposal were to pass Snapshot, the formation of the Oversight and Transparency Committee would commence. The DAO would elect 3 individuals to the OAT, with these individuals then promptly appointing 2 additional members with specialized skill sets to ensure all Arbitrum stakeholders\u2019 interests are represented and the OAT\u2019s proficiencies are varied and complete. Additionally, the Arbitrum Foundation will be given an observing and non-voting sixth seat on the OAT similar to the GCP. OAT members are expected to be able to contribute at least 10 hours per week to OAT-related tasks.\n\nOAT applicants are required to apply as individuals to increase accountability. Applicants are required to disclose any current or possible future conflicts of interest in their applications, including but not limited to financial, personal, and professional. Applicants are also required to disclose all active contributor roles and payment streams related to the Arbitrum DAO that they, and entities that they have a professional or financial relationship with, have and are receiving. The application process for the 3 DAO-elected members would be initiated soon after the OpCo proposal passes an offchain vote and would run for ~3 weeks. Note that the application period can be extended if the size of the applicant pool is limited. A shutterized, weighted voting system will be utilized on Snapshot, and the 3 applicants with the most votes will be chosen as members of the OAT. The DAO-elected members should then prioritize appointing 2 additional members (required to be individuals as well). The 2 additional members don\u2019t have to be appointed at the same time. The additional members will be added to the OAT optimistically, with the DAO having the ability to reject either/both of the additional members through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d). All members will serve until the end of the first OAT term unless removed or they resign.\n\nWhile the same internal OpCo employees as well as contracted service providers and individual contributors will continue in their roles across OpCo\u2019s terms if the DAO-adjacent entity is extended in the future, the OAT\u2019s term is 12 months, with a re-election process initiated when the OAT\u2019s term has around 3 months left. The DAO would again choose 3 members who then appoint 2 additional members. If the new cohort is different from the previous one, the previous OAT members are expected to help onboard the new members when the term is coming to an end. There are no consecutive term limits for OAT members. As the OAT is mandated to assist in OpCo\u2019s setup process, the first OAT term will be slightly longer than subsequent ones since it will include the period from when the initial OAT members are selected to the establishment of the entity, plus 12 months from the entity\u2019s official start date.\n\nAny individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-obseving seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative\u2019s or DAO-adjacent entity\u2019s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\n# NOTE: Due to Snapshot's character limit and the length of this proposal, the following sections have been omitted from this text compared to the forum post: OAT Applicant Requirements, OAT Compensation Structure, Governance and Compliance Requirements for OpCo, its Internal Employees, and the OAT, OpCo Financials and Costs, Snapshot Voting Structure, and Timeline.

In collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, input from MSS members, and based on conversations with key stakeholders and delegates, we are proposing to move forward by sunsetting the MSS. The multisig administration and payment processing responsibilities would be transferred to the Arbitrum Foundation, which is already deeply involved in the compliance and execution of nearly all MSS activity. MSS Signers will immediately begin the transition if this proposal passes Snapshot, and following the completion of this transition, receive final payments for their work. \n\nIf rejected, then Entropy will consider that delegates prefer to keep utilizing the MSS and will work to bring forward a proposal that restructures the MSS and a solution for the shortfall of funds.\n\n\n## Motivation & Rationale\n\nWhen the MSS was proposed in April 2024, the DAO was managing six active multisig wallets. Entropy accurately predicted that the number and complexity of DAO-affiliated multisigs would grow significantly, and today the MSS is involved with eight active multisigs, including:\n\n* MSS Payroll + R3gen\n* Delegate Incentive Program\n* Event Horizon\n* ADPC Subsidies\n* Hackathon Continuation Program\n* Stylus Sprint\n* ARDC V2\n* 2025 Events Budget\n\nThe original MSS proposal approved 600k ARB to cover the costs for R3gen\u2019s monthly token reports and payments for the 3 chairs and 9 signers connected to the MSS. Despite an ample buffer at the time, market conditions over the last year have placed the MSS in a position where funds will run out before the end of its term, unless ARB suddenly starts performing extremely well.\n\nAs a reminder, the MSS was originally structured with 9 signers paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB and 3 Chairs paid $2500 per month in ARB, both using the spot price at the time of payment. R3gen charges $6650 per month, paid upfront in ARB on the 1st of the month, also using USD/ARB spot price.\n\nThe MSS payroll multisig currently has 131,209.2 ARB (~$52,000, with ARB priced at ~$0.4) remaining, but with currently 2 active chairs and 8 signers, there is a total of $81,300 in commitments remaining. R3gen is owed two more payments for their June and July token reports, while the MSS members have 4 months of payment remaining (May-August) on their current term. At current prices, this would put the MSS on track to be short of funds following the July 1st payment to R3gen.\n\nIn April, Entropy, the Arbitrum Foundation, and MSS discussed potential solutions for the shortfall. Transferring the payment processing function to the Foundation was an option discussed and [shared](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/mss-for-arbitrum-communication-thread-arbitrum-multisig-support-service/26508/25?u=entropy) with the DAO by MSS chair @cattin. Following confirmation from the Foundation that they have operational bandwidth to take on such responsibilities, a partial transfer was considered by all parties, but it was deemed unfair to reduce MSS member pays due to the sustained level of risk MSS members take on by being signers. Even at $0.4, reducing the overall number of MSS members to 1 chair and 4 signers would still result in a shortfall. Another option is providing a top up of funds and beginning conversations on a restructured MSS; however, Entropy believes the best path forward is to formally wind down the MSS and recognize that the Arbitrum Foundation is better suited to take on payment responsibilities in the interim until OpCo is stood up, at which point the conversation shifts to moving the payment function to this entity.\n\nOver the MSS\u2019 tenure, operational improvements have happened and some of the recognized frictions could likely be further negated by restructuring the MSS to less signers, as the somewhat high threshold of 7/12 or 8/12 has proven to be inherently slow and inefficient. Regardless, given that the Foundation must be involved in every multisig anyway, the contributors of this proposal feel as though it\u2019s sensible for the DAO to formally recognize this reality and consolidate multisig operations under the Foundation\u2019s purview for the time being.\n\nThe primary rationale for consolidating the DAO\u2019s multisigs and payment processing under the Arbitrum Foundation instead of approving additional funds or restructuring pertains to the required compliance process and coordination between signers and the Arbitrum Foundation. The compliance requirements create a system that requires the Foundation to approve and review the recipient of nearly every payment. Whether under OpCo or the AF, consolidating the payment function under one accountable entity with the capabilities to conduct KYC/KYB is the most effective long-term solution.\n\nAdditional benefits include not only a reduction in total OpEx spending by the DAO, but also with full-time employees trained in OpSec and internal legal capacities, we believe that the funds will be safest in the hands of the Arbitrum Foundation until OpCo possesses similar capabilities. Finally, by marking the clear owner of the payroll function as the AF, responsibility for successes and failures will fall on a single party, giving the DAO greater accountability beyond the committee structure.\n\n## Specifications\n\nAfter inquiry, delegates expressed a preference to honor the agreement with R3gen and have them finish out the planned monthly token reports. To ensure that the MSS Payroll multisig has sufficient ARB to pay out R3gen for the remaining 2 reports, Entropy is proposing that the MSS wind down begins by transitioning the following multisigs to the Arbitrum Foundation with a target completion date of June 15th:\n\n* Delegate Incentive Program\n* Stylus Sprint\n* Hackathon Continuation Program\n* The DAO\u2019s 2025 Event Budget\n* Event Horizon\n* ADPC Subsidies\n* ARDC V2\n\nFollowing the completion of this transfer, the Arbitrum Foundation will share the updated addresses for the seven initiatives being transferred in the MSS communication thread. The Arbitrum Foundation has confirmed that funds for these ongoing programs will be separated into unique wallets so that they can continue to be easily tracked. Going forward, the Arbitrum Foundation has also agreed to continue this practice for any new initiatives in order to ensure delegates and the DAO have transparency on the state and flow of funds. Additionally, the Foundation has committed to providing updates when necessary; however, delegates should expect these to be at an informal cadence.\n\nThe following multisigs will remain under the control of the MSS:\n\n* MSS Payroll and R3gen\n\nAt the passing of this proposal (June 6th), the MSS will have discretion to pay R3gen upfront for their July token report if the price of ARB is high enough to secure the avoidance of a shortfall.\n\nOnce the above-mentioned multisigs have been transferred to the Arbitrum Foundation, the MSS will complete its tenure by sending a final payment to the MSS members for their work in June. With a target completion date of June 15th, MSS members will be paid one-half of their normal monthly compensation for June. If work for the MSS extends beyond June 15th, the members will be paid a pro-rata monthly rate up until June 30th. Following these final payments, the MSS will formally dissolve, returning any remaining ARB to the DAO\u2019s treasury and being absolved of any future payment responsibilities and risk.\n\nSimilar to the upfront payment of R3gen\u2019s work and if necessary due to extreme changes in market conditions, MSS members will have the discretion to send payments related to June work at an earlier date to avoid a shortfall.\n\nGoing forward, the payment vertical and its structure will be left up to the Arbitrum Foundation. In the event of resource constraints, Entropy recommends to the AF that they onboard a limited number of community members to assist with multisigs for smaller programs; however, this is something that will be up to the discretion of the Foundation. If the AF chooses to do so, they will have the mandate to structure the involvement of community contributions in the payroll function as they wish.\n\nOnce the OpCo has been operationalized and possesses similar payroll capabilities as the Arbitrum Foundation, we believe that responsibilities for the DAO\u2019s multisigs should be transferred to that entity. When that time comes, Entropy recommends for the Arbitrum Foundation and future head of OpCo to update the DAO with a joint statement.\n\nIf this proposal is rejected, then delegates would be signalling a preference to keep utilizing the MSS until OpCo\u2019s formation, at which point the conversation can be restarted on moving the payment function to that entity. If this is the prevailing decision, a top up would almost certainly be necessary to allow time for the full onchain proposal process & any possible follow-up procedures. In this scenario, Entropy will work to create a proposal that restructures the MSS, taking into account learnings and the opinions of relevant parties.\n\n## Timeline\n\nMay 22nd: Forum Post\nMay 29th - June 5th: Snapshot vote\nJune 6th: If approved, transfer of the previous MSS multisigs to the Foundation will begin.\nJune 15th: MSS' term comes to an end\n\n## Voting Options\n\n1. **For (Wind Down the MSS):** In support of winding down the MSS and transferring ownership of the payment vertical to the Arbitrum Foundation in the interim.\n2. **Against (Continue with the MSS):** Entropy begins working on a solution to the shortfall and creating a revised proposal that addresses the future structure of the payment vertical.\n3. **Abstain**", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "9effc89f-702b-465d-9c30-7ac954467564", "proposal_id": "4c1d960e-1539-471e-907f-464558486d14", "snapshot_id": "0xaa831b9306c3ec4f4a9b9731e7c445e540e5a24461a79f1166cb8dcdfa692d09", "title": "[Non-Constitutional] Whitelist Infura Nova Validator", "author_name": "0xA5dF0cf3F95C6cd97d998b9D990a86864095d9b0", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xaa831b9306c3ec4f4a9b9731e7c445e540e5a24461a79f1166cb8dcdfa692d09", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-09-26 03:08:17", "voting_end": "2024-10-03 03:08:17", "options": {"scores": [134936034.5074948, 29521.804208427893, 978234.4247466078], "choices": ["Whitelist Infura Validator", "Don't whitelist Infura Validator", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-10-03 03:08:17", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.969", "body": "Abstract\nThis proposal aims to whitelist a Nova validator operated by Infura, enhancing network security and reliability by leveraging their robust infrastructure and expertise.

This initiative is essential to preserve network growth, user engagement, and overall ecosystem stability in a highly dynamic market environment.\n\n## Rationale\n\nAligning with Arbitrum's mission to support and nurture its development community, the STIP Bridge embodies our commitment to our builders and their contributions. It strategically addresses the imminent risk of losing key ecosystem participants to competitors by offering a seamless transition in incentive support. This approach not only retains critical projects and liquidity within Arbitrum but also sets a solid foundation for the impending comprehensive Perpetual Incentives Program, reinforcing our long-term vision of innovation and community empowerment.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Eligibility\n\n* Any protocol funded under STIP is eligible to apply for a bridge grant coinciding with the LTIPP distribution window.\n* This will allow Arbitrum to ensure protocols that had success during the STIP campaign can retain their users and continue to focus on building on Arbitrum.\n\n## Maximum Funding Size:\n\nMaximum funding requests under this bridge grant are capped based on a percentage of the prior funding received under STIP:\n\n* Greater than 500k ARB: may make a funding request of up to 50% of their prior funding.\n* Less than or equal to 500k ARB: may make funding requests up to 100% of their prior funding, capped at 250k ARB.\n\n## Addendum on STIP Forum post:\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project\u2019s original STIP forum post, projects will be included in a list of all extension applicants. Specifically, a project should add the tag \u201cSTIP Bridge\u201d to the end of their forum post. The addendum is intended to be relatively lightweight, not requiring a full STIP type proposal but should still include:\n\n* Requested amount (protocols have the option to size down their asks if they deem it more appropriate, including to help secure the support of delegates).\n* Data on the performance of their activities during STIP.\n* If the intended use of incentives is different than STIP, then details of the updated usage.\n* Links to bi-weekly STIP performance reports and Openblocks Dashboard.\n\n## Voting and Approval Mechanism:\n\n### Optimistic Approach\n\nAn optimistic voting mechanism will be used to mitigate the potential for delegate fatigue from voting on 50+ proposals while still holding projects accountable for their overall performance within STIP and in general.\n\nThis optimistic model hopes to reduce the load on all delegates but ensure that the DAO's full attention is placed on the more contentious proposals.\n\n### Voting Mechanism\n\nThe current snapshot and the immediately subsequent Tally vote will earmark funds to allow the DAO to distribute up to the maximum permissible grants.\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project's original STIP forum post, all properly submitted projects will be included in a list of extension applicants for consideration to be funded.\n\nDuring the challenge review period, any delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated can put up a forum post and an associated snapshot proposal that will result in a full DAO vote for the individual grant streams for it to be approved.  \n\nDelegates may seek a full DAO vote at their own discretion if they believe that a project did (a) not fulfill their STIP requirements, (b) failed to deliver tangible results during the STIP period or (c) the amount sought in the bridge application would not result in an effective utilization of the DAO\u2019s funds.\n\nThis will allow the DAO delegates to focus their available attention to more closely examine contested applications. To be accepted into the bridge program alongside the unchallenged proposals, the proposal to fund must receive a supermajority (66%) of votes in favor.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* Send funds to STIP multisig\n* Create an addendum template for applicants\n* Have applicants post addendums\n* Conduct DAO challenge vote on Snapshot\n* Conduct individual Snapshot votes for any challenged application\n* Have successful applicants complete compliance\n* Start streams at the same time as LTIPP protocols\n* Monitored incentives throughout the program as done in STIP\n\n# Timeline\n\nThis is a rough timeline. We aim to start the STIP Bridge at the same time as LTIPP.\n\n* Week 1 (March 11 - 17)\n  * Posted to Governance Forum\n  * If requested, Community Call including discussion of Voting Mechanism\n* Week 2 (March 22 - 29)\n  * Snapshot Vote for the creation of Bridge Program\n* Week 3\n  * Tally Vote for establishing funding to LTIPP or community multisig (17 days)\n  * Start of 2-week window for protocols to submit addendums, protocols are encouraged but not obligated to submit early to allow delegates time to review\n* Week 4\n  * Continue addendum submissions\n* Week 5\n  * One week Optimistic Approval / Challenge Vote Period\n* Week 6\n  * Tally vote ends (17 days)\n  * Review and discussion period of remaining protocols not cleared in Optimistic / Challenge voting\n  * Vote on remaining contested applicants\n* Week 6\n  * STIP.b & LTIPP incentives start at the same time\n\n# Overall Cost\n\n\n## Incentives Budget: \n37,025,522 ARB\nSee estimated amounts [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ic15cTQNoa6xyIJcp-X8OC175MaCLMPrXtMW5eT87sI/edit#gid=1867228162)\n\nThe incentives budget above is the maximum allocation earmarked, any extra funds not used due to ineligible asks, projects not applying, or other reasons returned to the multisig. \n\n### Overhead: 0M ARB\n\n\n* Assumed to be the same data provider and multisig as STIP without added cost.\n* Analytics: This proposal should result in no material increase in work for the analytics vendor, given that the same team already covers STIP protocols, was mandated for making dashboards for the same, and is mandated for the entire time of LTIPP. Additionally, the multisig signing can be done at the same time as other disbursements or will use oSnap reducing the need for multi-sig signing.\n* If there is an objection, a volunteer multisig from the DAO will be assembled and community grants can be allocated by the LTIPP special grants for taking over the existing dashboards from STIP, as they are open source and IP rights if any already resides with the DAO.\n\n## Proposers:\nIncludes some proposers and developers of both STIP round 1, Backfund, LTIP and an LTIP Council member. \nAlex Lumley of SavvyDao, Dan Peng of Vela Exchange, CoinflipCanada of GMX", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "a137723b-78e3-4695-acc6-4f8d1a00b7e6", "proposal_id": "93e8d79a-b5ef-4665-befb-b2f2f70808d1", "snapshot_id": "0x38663c36b26252acff6c6ca43663167858f51f960235dc0441bd2ad4a8f66fb1", "title": "Let\u2019s improve our governance forum with three proposals.app feature integrations", "author_name": "0xA7860E99e3ce0752D1ac53b974E309fFf80277C6", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x38663c36b26252acff6c6ca43663167858f51f960235dc0441bd2ad4a8f66fb1", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-06-12 20:51:39", "voting_end": "2025-06-19 20:51:39", "options": {"scores": [42075203.14029506, 96607005.15538342, 53380666.09916272], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-06-19 20:51:39", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.09", "body": "# Let\u2019s improve our governance forum with three proposals.app feature integrations\n\n## Abstract\n\n[proposals.app](https://proposals.app) proposes a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO to enhance the usability of this governance forum, so that delegates, tokenholders, and forum readers can have more context and information about our DAO proposals. We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of one year, for a total of **$60,000 USD**.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently, DAO governance remains a disjointed, messy, and confusing experience for delegates and tokenholders.** We believe that one of the main reasons for this is the clear lack of foundational DAO tooling that prioritizes true composability and aggregates data from multiple (even competing) offchain and onchain sources, thereby providing a more comprehensive and enjoyable user experience for DAO delegates and tokenholders. We believe that to achieve this, DAO tools should be free and open-source, operate under a non-profit entity that ideally has public financial records of its operations. At proposals.app, we strive to uphold these beliefs.\n\n[Andrei](https://andreiv.com) and I have been building DAO tools since mid-2023, starting with [Senate](https://x.com/SenateLabs), where we previously piloted two forum integrations (one with [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044), and another with [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680)), and more recently, we\u2019ve been working on [proposals.app](https://x.com/proposalsapp), where we\u2019ve developed dedicated tooling for Arbitrum DAO\u2019s governance needs that was funded through [a questbook grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) last October. More specifically, we\u2019ve designed and developed a [unified governance aggregator](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-proposals-app-govhack-brussels-winner/25370) that brings together, under the same platform, the discourse forum comments and both offchain and onchain votes, so that delegates can access the complete history of every proposal in Arbitrum DAO. We launched it publicly on April 5\u1d57\u02b0 at ETH Bucharest 2025, and you can check it out at [arbitrum.proposals.app](https://arbitrum.proposals.app)\u00a0and share your thoughts about it with us in [our telegram chat](https://t.me/+U9QrY4L8wfNiMzA8).\n\nWe\u2019re now proposing **a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO** to bring some of the exclusive proposals.app features we have in our app, to this governance forum. **We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum**, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of\u00a012 months.\n\n![Demo of the three proposals.app feature integrations](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7e148a110ffeb8388f8bccdee73242f41437c45d.gif)\n\nWe believe that **these three features will enhance usability and accessibility**\u00a0in this governance forum for all users, regardless of their level of maturity.\n\nThese three features, as demonstrated above, are:\n\n1. **Live Votes** \u2013 Show the live or latest vote at the top of the page for each forum topic in the proposals category\n2. **Voting Power Tags** \u2013 Show the voting power of each delegate, under their username, for every comment on the forum\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** \u2013 Provide a way for forum visitors to subscribe to email notifications, receiving an email every time a new discussion is started, when an offchain or onchain vote begins, and when its voting period is nearing completion.\n\nWith these three proposals.app feature integrations in this forum, we believe will see **bigger governance participation and better engagement in discussions**, from a more diverse set of delegates and tokenholders, who will have more context about who is commenting on what, about when proposals are up to a vote and where and when to vote in each moment of the proposal lifecycle.\n\nWe shared a short demo of proposals.app and these three proposed feature integrations on the [Open Governance Call on June 3rd](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/june-3-2025-open-discussion-of-proposals-governance-call/29377?u=paulofonseca), and you can see the recording of that demo and presentation, as well as some Q&A, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MToHsWqQxs).\n\n## Rationale\n\nConstantly improving and caring for the governance processes in Arbitrum DAO is essential to maintain a healthy, engaged, resilient, and decentralized DAO. In Arbitrum DAO\u2019s case, where tokenholders and delegates actually have on-chain control over protocol upgrades and treasury spending, it becomes even more critical that\u00a0**they vote with as much context and information as possible in each and every vote.**\n\nAdditionally,\u00a0**in token-weighted voting DAOs, not all voices carry the same weight.** Powerful delegates commenting and giving feedback on proposals are crucial signals of support. On the other hand, newly created forum accounts with no voting power, which are becoming more prevalent in the age of AI, make way more noise than signal and disrupt the discussion flow. Proposers and readers should be able to distinguish between the two and everything in between, much more easily.\n\nAs stated in [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), we should strive to follow our stated Community Values, and specifically:\n\n> **Neutral and open:** Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.\n\nWe believe it\u2019s essential for Arbitrum DAO to have multiple governance platforms available to its tokenholders, delegates, and voters, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them with tools that suit their particular needs and help them engage in governance in an easier and clearer way.\n\nWe also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. Regarding the obvious matter of the resilience of Arbitrum\u2019s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum\u2019s DAO governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue participating in governance permissionlessly. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) [is fully open source](https://github.com/proposals-app/proposalsapp) and will continue to be. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we\u2019re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time, by anybody in the world.\n\n## Specifications\n\nTo implement these three forum feature integrations described above, we will create **three distinct Discourse theme components**, rather than Discourse plugins.\n\nThis way, admins of Discourse hosted instances (like the one for the Arbitrum DAO forum) can easily install each one of these feature integrations from a GitHub repo link (where the code will be fully open-source and auditable, of course) and manage the updates for each feature integration independently, as we evolve and maintain them after the initial deployment.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is how we previously integrated with the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044) and [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680) governance forums, in the past.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nWe will design, develop, test, and deploy these 3 Discourse forum proposals.app feature integrations, **in the following order**:\n\n1. **Voting Power Tags** \u2013 Showing discourse users\u2019 voting power alongside their usernames in every topic and post in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. To achieve this, we must **retrieve all previous delegation data for the $ARB token**\u00a0and\u00a0**maintain a mapping between the top discourse users and voting wallets**\u00a0on Arbitrum DAO. This voting power tag will always display the current voting power of each delegate by default. Upon clicking on it, the delegate's voting power at the time the comment was posted will be displayed instead.\n![Voting Power Tag showing Entropy's 25.7M ARB delegated voting power, at the time of posting this comment.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02def7ab1879f9cda62eb6e95cc3a5b5efbfb34b.png)\n\n2. **Live Votes** \u2013 In every proposal posted in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum, which goes up for an offchain or onchain vote, we will display a component at the top of the forum proposal page, which shows that there is an active offchain or onchain vote, the current live results of that offchain or onchain vote, and a link to vote on it. To achieve this, we must **map all forum proposals and their respective Snapshot votes and onchain votes**, as well as index all voting data from either Snapshot\u2019s API or the onchain Arbitrum DAO Governors (both the non-constitutional Arbitrum Treasury governor and the constitutional Arbitrum Core governor).\n![Live Vote results on the Quorum Threshold Reduction proposal in the forum, showing that there is an active offchain vote which ends in 4 hours, and directing delegates to the voting platform.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71103527189f961b216823e9244ce2bada38daa1_2_1380x608.png)\n\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** \u2013 In the Arbitrum DAO governance forum homepage, we will display a \u201cSetup Proposal Notifications\u201d button, which will open a modal for forum users to subscribe to email notifications, so that they can receive timely emails whenever a new proposal discussion is posted on the forum, when an offchain or onchain vote starts, and when an offchain or onchain vote is about to end. To achieve this, **we need to maintain a GDPR-compliant list of emails and newsletters**, as well as **a dedicated subdomain and address** to send email notifications from, ensuring optimal email deliverability for those email notifications.\n![Modal to subscribe to proposal email notifications](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2bf33def77a835475b48e616c3167df940d980c6_2_1380x542.jpeg)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the successful approval of this proposal and the initial onchain transfer, we will hold a project kickoff call and begin building the first integration, the\u00a0**Voting Power Tags**, which we can deploy and deliver within one month. Then we will work on the **Live Votes** integration, which we can also deploy and deliver within one month. Finally, we will work on the\u00a0**Proposal Notification Emails**\u00a0integration, which we will also deploy and deliver within one month.\n\nIn total, it will take us **1 month to deliver these three feature integrations** to the Arbitrum DAO after the project kickoff call, which should happen after a successful onchain vote. During this time, we will work with all Arbitrum DAO delegates to gather feedback on this functionality and improve it to meet your needs. After deploying all these integrations, we will **maintain and host them for a period of 12 months**.\n\n![Timeline](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18798e403cebe644a8d714f49321de47ce8af6a4_2_1380x400.png)\n\nWe plan to put this proposal up for a temperature check **offchain vote on Thursday, June 12th**.

PLEASE REVIEW THOROUGHLY AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2024.\n\n## Abstract\n\nOn September 12th, Entropy hosted a preliminary treasury working group call (recordings available [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/6?u=entropy)) in an effort to align all of the different parties within the DAO on the optimal path forward when it comes to managing the different sections of the DAO\u2019s balance sheet. I.e., chain profits (ETH) and tokens that have been authorized for spend but have not entered circulation yet (ARB). The primary points of contention were around ARB diversification, the need for a DAO budget before the conversation on treasury management continues forward, whether the DAO needs active treasury managers at all, infrastructure selection, and details around a treasury committee\u2019s implementation, e.g., how many individuals/entities, are they DAO-elected or appointed, when should we target to have this committee stood up, etc. From our perspective, we did gain consensus that the DAO\u2019s profits (ETH) in the treasury should be turned productive and that a treasury management committee of some sort should be established. However, even on these two points that most people seem to be in favor of, specific details need to be ironed out for actionable strategies to be implemented.\n\nWe believe that we have come up with a fair compromise between all of the various perspectives on these identified issues, all of which stem from the information gathered during the working group calls and conversations with delegates. The compromise suggested herein will, in our opinion, enable the DAO to move forward and initiate the required operational standards for optimizing the use of idle tokens in the treasury. Based on the feedback received on the call on September 25th (link to recording [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/7?u=swmartin)) where we presented the overarching ideas herein, we feel confident that this proposal aligns well with the treasury managers, infrastructure providers, and overall DAO sentiment towards treasury management. We are eager to gather more feedback from the community and continue iterating so this initiative can move forward.\n\n## Key Issues Treasury Management can Solve Today\n\n1. Service Provider Shortfalls: DAO-funded programs as well as service providers that have proved valuable to the DAO (the ARDC, Steakhouse\u2019s services as a part of STEP, etc.) have run into the problem of having dollar-denominated contracts and not enough ARB to meet the agreed upon rate for services rendered.\n2. Flexible & Metrics-Driven Capital Deployment: The DAO is reliant on RWAs/Treasuries for passive yield on dollars, but has no mechanism for reallocating to onchain strategies as we enter a global rate cutting regime that could make onchain yields more attractive. The DAO also currently lacks the ability to frictionlessly assess the returns and underlying risks of comparative liquid market investments, how much of/when ARB in the treasury should be diversified, and how to optimize operating cash-like reserves.\n3. Reinvesting Sequencer Revenue: The DAO has neglected to do anything productive with its ETH holdings, which could provide the DAO leverage to fuel growth and partnerships alongside yield\u2014consistent with the DAO\u2019s growth-first mindset.\n\n## The Proposed Solution\n\n### TL;DR\n\n* Establish two token management tracks (Treasury and Growth) with their own 3-seat committees. Treasury Management will focus on passive yield via ARB-only onchain strategies on Arbitrum One and create a cash-like reserve alongside a management strategy to cover service provider shortfalls. Growth Management will focus on strategic partnerships by exclusively reinvesting the DAO\u2019s ETH holdings into \u201cETH-backed strategies\u201d. ETH-backed strategies are defined as opportunities that earn yield on ETH or ETH-pegged assets, with high guarantees of returning the underlying deployed to the DAO treasury at a certain point in the future.\n  * Treasury Management (TM): 10M ARB for ARB-only onchain strategies + 15M ARB converted to stables or other cash-like holdings to serve as a pilot for the DAO\u2019s \u201cchecking account\u201d.\n  * Growth Management (GM): 7,500 ETH allotted (about 75% of the DAOs ETH after BoLD bootstrapping), but all spend must be DAO-approved on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSuggested Treasury Management Committee (TMC) Members:\n\n* **Austin Campbell**:\n  * With a multi-decade background in trading, financial risk management, and structuring, [Austin Campbell](https://x.com/CampbellJAustin) is regarded as a leading expert in the field of tokenized assets, stablecoins, and crypto risk management. Austin has run trading desks at JP Morgan and Citigroup, been the head of portfolio management and chief risk officer at Paxos, and is currently the CEO of WSPN USA, a stablecoin issuer. Austin also teaches blockchain courses at NYU Stern school of business, speaks frequently on podcasts, to the media, and at regulatory events, and testified in front of Congress on stablecoins in 2023.\n  * Austin believes that treasury management in the crypto space should focus on principal protection, liquidity to ensure smooth operations, and risk-adjusted return, in that order. Austin has helped with previous efforts in this space when at Paxos, including the inclusion of USDP into the PSM for MakerDAO, as well as partnering with protocols to ensure strong economic design and stability when integrating stablecoins and real assets. A robust RFP process, a rigorous set of standards for anyone managing treasury assets, and programs for monitoring performance, activities, and conflicts are things that Austin believes are mandatory for effective treasury programs.\n \nAustin will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\n* **Three Sigma**:\n  * As seasoned experts in the DeFi ecosystem, [Three Sigma](https://threesigma.xyz/) is uniquely positioned to add significant value to Arbitrum's Treasury Management Council (TMC). With vast experience in risk assessment and advisory services, Three Sigma is equipped to collaboratively design and execute a transparent Request for Proposal (RFP) process for treasury managers. These RFPs will strategically identify managers aligned with the DAO's objectives\u2014such as converting ARB to stablecoins, optimizing fund deployment, and managing whitelisted ARB strategies.\n  * Three Sigma's commitment extends beyond process design, as they will serve as vigilant overseers of treasury management strategies, proactively flagging any questionable activities to the DAO. Drawing from extensive experience in helping teams design protocols with risk in mind, they uphold the principle: \"Don't trust, verify.\" Three Sigma will develop a robust methodology focused on risk-adjusted returns, evaluate service provider performance, and deliver quarterly reports to the DAO forum. These reports will offer transparent insights into performance metrics, stablecoin balances, and strategic recommendations for asset liquidation or replenishment. Leveraging their deep understanding of DeFi markets, risk management, and governance, Three Sigma aims to drive optimal outcomes for the Arbitrum DAO, safeguarding the community's assets with unwavering accountability.\n\nThree Sigma will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\n* **Make Markets**:\n  * A bespoke consulting agency focused on liquidity strategy design and optimization for asset issuers, Make Markets brings deep crypto-native technical expertise to Arbitrum's Treasury Management Council through its principals [fiddyresearch](https://x.com/fiddyresearch), a core contributor to Curve DAO, and benny, a seasoned DeFi builder, analytics specialist and contributor to Curve DAO. We combine practical DeFi protocol engineering experience with extensive knowledge of smart contract security, on-chain data analysis and decentralized market mechanics. Their technical background enables them to assess smart contract risk and economic security considerations when reviewing strategy proposals for managers. They will also leverage our analytics capabilities and familiarity with on-chain data to provide data-driven reporting to the DAO.\n  * Make Markets believes that the TMC's success depends on establishing robust, standardized processes for evaluating and monitoring treasury managers. Their goal is to implement systematic approaches that ensure fair selection, efficient oversight, and clear performance assessment across all treasury activities. They aim to establish consistent and transparent processes that will serve the DAO over the long term and ensure accountability to the community.\n\nMake Markets will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n\n**Suggested Growth Management Committee (GMC) Members**:\n\n* [Entropy Advisors](https://x.com/EntropyAdvisors)\n  * Entropy Advisors will be waiving payment.\n* [Callen](https://x.com/cvant_) from Wintermute\n  * Callen will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.\n* [Llama Risk](https://www.llamarisk.com/)\n  * Llama Risk will be paid based on 20K USDC per milestone reached.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "a23e6f95-3b31-4897-b5a0-2d7e1280dd9e", "proposal_id": "4b6eb958-04a4-4d84-a0d1-b25fd9993479", "snapshot_id": "0x0b62de171fbff7a81833f9ebb44b9747189264d7a2cf95e3446223b1c413d2b0", "title": "DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)", "author_name": "0xb4c064f466931B8d0F637654c916E3F203c46f13", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x0b62de171fbff7a81833f9ebb44b9747189264d7a2cf95e3446223b1c413d2b0", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-05-16 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2025-05-23 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [170220277.59459034, 3836791.217868113, 32066307.202646784], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-05-23 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.134", "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n- Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n- Added a clear responsibility for the program's successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n- Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy. \n- Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start. \n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15. \n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The \u201c3-month\u201d timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season\u2019s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849?u=entropy) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO\u2019s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos\u2019](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks\u2019](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum\u2019s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum\u2019s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. \u201cLooping,\u201d creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum\u2019s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category\u2019s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto\u2019s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum's penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum\u2019s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n\n* **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n\n* **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:7, topic:23438\"]\n\nTo summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program\u2019s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this\u2014protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher \u201csteady states\u201d compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\nTVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nestablished protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nThe proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP\u2019s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, \u201cIncrease trading activity\u201d, is not a specific goal, but \u201ccreate the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One\u201d would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting \u201ccritical mass,\u201d where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive \u201cseason\u201d is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season\u2019s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season\u2019s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs\u2019 operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program\u2019s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum\u2019s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n\u2154 votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program. \n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. \n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\nSnapshot: May 15\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates. \n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026.

The Arbitrum Foundation has expressed that they\u2019ll be converting 15M ARB to Stablecoins per their internal policies.\n**Stablecoin Allocation (15M ARB Equivalent)**\n- Scope: This group covers the process of managing stablecoins.\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n- Gauntlet\n\n\nAllocation Strategy: The stablecoin management responsibilities will be evenly split among the three partners with a 33/33/33 distribution, ensuring diversification and balanced risk exposure while meeting the conversion and liquidity objectives.\n---\n\n# TMC Recommendation\nWe recommend a vote of YES to deploy the Stablecoin Strategy.\nOur analysis shows that the stablecoin strategies presented by the selected partners meet our criteria for DAO alignment, returns, risk management, etc.\n# Voting Outcomes\nPlease cast your vote on each allocation separately. Your options are as follows:\nStablecoin Strategy Allocation Vote:\n- Yes: Proceed with converting 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage them via a 33/33/33 split among Karpatkey, Avantgarde & Myso, and Gauntlet.\n- No: Do not execute the stablecoin strategy; retain current ARB holdings without conversion.\n\n---\n\n# Other Proposals\nDuring our review process, we evaluated several proposals that ultimately did not meet the criteria, required further clarity, or didn\u2019t align with DAO objectives. \n\n- **AnthiasLabs x XBTO:** Their proposal did not provide adequate detail on stablecoin conversion, DAO alignment, or custody arrangements, which are critical to our objectives.\n\n- **August Digital:** While proposing a single-sided AMM strategy for both ARB yield and ARB-to-USD conversion, the proposal provided minimal details. There was no evidence of existing ARB strategies or a dedicated vault, and the timeline for necessary audits\u2014if smart contracts are involved\u2014was not addressed. Moreover, the risk management section appeared generic, with much of the content seemingly repurposed from other contexts.\n\n- **Bracket Labs:** The submission lacked clarity on key operational components, such as the choice of OTC counterparties or DEXes. Additionally, the rationale behind the 2% trading volume figure and the associated price impact considerations were not explained. Although a Stablecoin Vault is reportedly live, the lack of public transparency and reliance on historical yield figures from related funds (rather than the target vault) were significant concerns, compounded by high fee structures.\n\n- **WINR:** The implementation details were insufficient, leading to concerns over the alignment of risk and reward.\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit -- Further Clarification on Shortlisted Rationale\nStablecoin Strategies:\nProviders like Karpatkey, Avantgarde/MYSO, and Gauntlet stood out due to their provided backtests, clear execution plans, compensation structure, and risk management frameworks.\nWe have high confidence in their ability to manage and deploy 15M ARB worth of stablecoins in well-established, low-risk protocols\u2014aligned with the intended use of funds. \nThe shortlisted proposals target an average yield of 8% to 12% under varying market conditions while primarily holding USDC and USDT.\nThis is why we\u2019re recommending a YES vote on the stablecoin allocation.\n---\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy**\n\n|Stablecoin Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp. Returns | Fees|\n|--- | --- | --- | ---|\n|Gauntlet | AAVE V3 | 8% | Free|\n|Karpatkey | Uniswap v3, Camelot v3, Balancer v2/v3, GMX, Aave v3, Compound v3, Fluid, Vertex (Perps), Pendle (Yield) | 12-20% | 0.5% management|\n|AvantGarde/MYSO | AAVE V3, Compound (core),  Pendle, Fluid, and Uni v3 (satellite) | 5-15% | 0.5% / 10% management/performance|\n\n---\n\n\n## Key Risks\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\n* **Stablecoin Risk:** The possibility of a stablecoin depegging.\n* **Smart Contract Risk:** Exposure to potential hacks of the protocols used by each provider.\n* **Liquidity Risk:** Funds may become locked if the lending rate reaches 100%.\n* **Optimization Risk:** The provider\u2019s optimization might not perform as intended or may fail to beat the benchmark.\n* **Custody Risk:** Since the Foundation remains the custodian, custody risk is effectively transferred to the Foundation.\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Alignment Consideration:**\nA key criterion for evaluating submissions was alignment with Arbitrum. While most strategies will be executed on the Arbitrum network, not all will involve Arbitrum native protocols.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this but the main ones are the absence of proposals by Arbitrum native protocols and the fact that most liquidity on Arbitrum is on non-native protocols, making it difficult to allocate a large amount of stablecoin while retaining a competitive yield.\n\nGiven the dearth of sufficient proposals, our recommendation is to do nothing rather than something not justifiable from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n---\n\n\n# Edit 06.03.2025 V3\nFurther Clarification on the Shortlisted Rationale\n\n\n# Feedback on Karpatkey\u2019s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nWe appreciate Karpatkey\u2019s detailed Risk Management Plan, which includes non-custodial architecture (Safe + Zodiac Roles Modifier), protocol whitelisting (Aave, Compound, Dolomite, Fluid, etc.), and clear maximum exposure thresholds (e.g., no more than 20\u201325% per protocol).\n\nThe yield estimates of ~8\u201312% for stablecoins appear realistic, and Karpatkey\u2019s track record in managing other DAO treasuries (Gnosis, ENS, etc.) is well-documented.\n\n# Feedback on Avantgarde\u2019s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nThe Risk Management section shared by Avantgarde (and MYSO) highlights position-sizing constraints, lockup safeguards, and a diversified stablecoin approach. We especially appreciate the plan\u2019s clarity on monitoring liquidity needs and the ability for the DAO to recall funds if necessary.\n\nExpected returns of 5\u201315% are in line with typical DeFi yields, and the approach includes established protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap.\n\n---\n\n# Reminder of Grading Criteria\nOur evaluation of proposals was based on the following key factors:\n- **25% \u2013 Experience & Track Record:** Demonstrated ability to manage treasury assets securely and effectively.\n- **25% \u2013 Risk Management:** Strength and clarity of risk mitigation measures under diverse market conditions.\n- **15% \u2013 Alignment with DAO Goals:** Consistency with the DAO\u2019s growth objectives and ecosystem utility enhancement.\n- **15% \u2013 Expected Returns:** Realistic yield projections and sound risk-adjusted performance metrics.\n- **20% \u2013 Transparency & Reporting:** Commitment to regular, clear reporting and continuous performance monitoring.\n\n----\n\n# Timelines & Next Steps\n\nWe will move forward with a vote on Snapshot next Thursday, March 27, 2025.\n\n\n**ARB Conversion & Stablecoin Management (15M ARB)**\n\n**IF YES, the Stablecoin strategy is deployed:**\n- Initiate a three\u2011month phase to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins via the Foundation.\n- Proceed with the deployment of low\u2011risk, yield\u2011bearing strategies for the converted stablecoins, with regular performance and risk reporting.\n\n**IF NO, the Stablecoin strategy is not deployed:**\n- Retain the current ARB holdings without conversion.\n- No further actions will be taken regarding stablecoin management until a new decision is reached.\n\n\n**Additional Next Steps for Both Allocations**\nThree months after the managers have been elected, publish a comprehensive report detailing the performance and management outcomes and re-evaluate the allocation strategy for potential adjustments.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "a6118e3f-7aa6-4660-9fb5-d861ab9b3350", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x76ebc8056e283411cfed5cefad171e245b56fe3bc3d36d702244aab3faae689c", "title": "Restitution For Extensively Delayed ArbitrumDAO Minigrant Winners", "author_name": "0xb29A655f3D67B2B6724Fb22B2C2303cB660c946B", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x76ebc8056e283411cfed5cefad171e245b56fe3bc3d36d702244aab3faae689c", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-11-21 12:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-11-28 12:00:00", "options": {"scores": [24012266.693243258, 107092740.52971432, 1038908.7275192436], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-11-28 12:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.914", "body": "## Abstract:\n\nThis is a proposal for financial compensation for a number of winners that participated in \u201cArbitrumDAO\u2019s Biggest Minigrants Round Ever.\u201d This was a grant round with 32 winners over a period of 8 weeks, starting in January 2024. 19 projects received their payouts 3-7 months later, which caused significant confusion, stress, and blockages in their ability to execute their projects.

Arbiter receives the arbiter community role in the arbitrum discord after having made significant contributions to Arbitrum, as recognized by members of the Arbitrum team.\n\nOver the three-year period 2021-2023, these contributors played a key role in the development of Arbitrum, from translating, advising, publicizing, and docking projects to community support, fraud prevention, and docking activities etc. At the time of the Arbitrum DAO's inception, Arbiters did not receive any airdrops or rewards.\n\nBy establishing a transparent and fair reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, our goal is to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication to the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Considering that arbiters did not keep proof of their contributions before and after the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO, and that a great deal of their work could not be counted or quantified, the dedication of each arbiter is also exceptionally valuable.\n\nAll members of arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal as a whole and agreed on an equal share of the reward amount.\n\n**Foreword:** 25 Arbiters come from different countries with different time zones, speak different languages. Arbiters have been deprecated by the Arbitrum team, and it has become extremely difficult to bring arbiters together. Arbiters who have made outstanding contributions to the Arbitrum community from 2021 to 2023. Compared to on-chain activists and ecosystem projects which have conducted a large number of airdrops, arbiters haven\u2019t received any airdrop retroactive rewards\n\nConsidering the large number of contributions made by arbiters prior to the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO that have not been effectively preserved, and the fact that there are many members whose work cannot be counted and quantified, and that the dedication of each arbiter has been exceptionally valuable, all members of the arbiters have agreed that arbiters as a whole should initiate the proposal. All members of Arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal and apply for retroactive awards for Arbiters as a whole.\n\nArbiter as a whole (or project) is asking for retroactive rewards. If each member's contribution is listed one by one to make a forced comparison, this will bring arbiter infinite tug-of-war, mutual disputes, suspicion etc.. At the same time, Arbiter is not professional to establish a very systematic and perfect evaluation system.\n\nSpecial statement: As the earliest arbitrum contributor, arbiter is retroactively obtaining voting rights and voice in the governance of Arbitrum DAO. The Arbitrum DAO airdrop to early adopters and ecosystem projects also does not take price into account, but rather the weight of governance. The choice of 125,000 $ARB is fully considered (explained in detail below). If the current arb price is $0.1, the arbiter also only apply for 125,000 $ARB, which has little to do with price.\n\n**Motivation:** The Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\n1.Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum\u2019s development.\n\n2.Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\n\n3.Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\n\n4.Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n**Rationale:** The Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in shaping Arbitrum over the past two years.

It helps that Cian also has a history of growth. We recommend approving this grant.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\nCian\u2019s application was very strong and scored well across multiple areas. They provided clear milestones, KPIs, and goals. Furthermore, they provided sufficient calculations and justifications for their grant size and milestones given the level of activity of the protocol.\nThe protocol has demonstrated clear demand from users with very strong TVL and userbase across multiple networks. The execution strategy is simple and will have second-order effects due to its composability, however, we would\u2019ve liked to see some more innovation on encouraging users to migrate to Arbitrum.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR Cian's proposal.\n\nGood proposal and decent growth since launching. Driving further LST adoption on Arbitrum is necessary and will help solidify Arbitrum's competitive position in the market. Straightforward request and good grant size to support well-justified KPI/metric targets. Cian's Grand Adventure initiative is novel and supports longer-term stickiness that may potentially outlive LTIPP.

Gearbox has a unique and novel product that complements DeFi well and is very composable. They have proven their ability to achieve PMF and work with incentives\nThey provided clear objectives, KPIs, and goals, and a sufficient justification for their requested grant size.\nTheir execution strategy has a nice focus on migrating their existing users to Arbitrum while focusing on hot sectors in DeFi. We would\u2019ve liked have seen a bit more details in their execution strategy regarding rewarding trading volume and anti-sybil measures.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nWe\u2019re hesitant at this level of grant funding, but the applicant has demonstrated exceptional adoption on mainnet in recent months. The strong performance and track record of the applicant generally overcomes the large size of the request to what is effectively to deploy to Arbitrum.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nGearbox\u2019s proposal introduces a unique feature called Credit Accounts, an account abstraction primitive that has the potential to attract significant capital to Arbitrum. The objectives outlined in the proposal are clear, well-defined, and aligned with driving growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their execution strategy, incorporating mechanisms such as farming and incentivizing margin trading, demonstrates a thoughtful approach to achieving the program's goals. The allocation of resources and incentives across different pools and strategies reflects a strategic focus on driving user engagement and liquidity provision.\n\n\nThe proposed timeline and milestones are realistic, offering a clear pathway for assessing progress throughout the grant period. Emphasizing target utilization ratios and total transaction volume underscores a commitment to driving user adoption and engagement, vital for the success of any protocol. Furthermore, their strategy to incentivize stickiness through continued integration with other protocols highlights a long-term commitment to enhancing composability within the ecosystem, benefiting not only Gearbox but also other projects and the overall Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n\nAdditionally, Gearbox has a proven track record of innovation, attracting users with both simplistic interfaces and high yields, such as their leveraged ETH EigenPoint system. The grant size appears modest considering the value Gearbox brings to the ecosystem, enabling users to explore new DeFi strategies with ease.

Stylus is an upgrade that introduces a new virtual machine that runs alongside the EVM. This enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.\n\n## Motivation\n\nStylus is a first-of-its-kind technology resulting from breakthrough engineering efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Unlike other alternative VMs, Stylus is purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable.\n\nSome defining features of Stylus include:\n\n- Preferred Languages: There are [estimated](https://research.slashdata.co/reports/65b90140343d024fbe70f369) to be roughly 20k Solidity developers, compared to 3.5 million Rust developers and 10 million C++ developers. Developers can use their preferred programming language, all interoperable with each other, on any Arbitrum chain with Stylus. Scaling to the next billion users requires onboarding the next million developers.\n- EVM+: Stylus brings the best of both worlds. Developers still get all of the benefits of the EVM, including the ecosystem and liquidity, while getting efficiency improvements and access to existing libraries in Rust, C, and C++ \u2014 without changing anything about how the EVM works. EVM equivalence is no longer the ceiling; it\u2019s the floor.\n- Cheaper Execution: Stylus is a more efficient execution environment than the EVM, leading directly to gas savings for complex smart contracts. Computation can be over 10x cheaper, and memory can be over 100x cheaper. Cryptography libraries can be deployed as custom application layer precompiles, permissionlessly. Use cases that are impractical in the EVM are now possible in Stylus.\n- Safer By Design: Stylus doesn\u2019t just improve on cost and speed. WASM programs are also safer. Reentrancy is a common vulnerability that developers can only attempt to mitigate in Solidity. Stylus provides cheap reentrancy detection, and using the Rust SDK, reentrancy is disabled by default, unless intentionally overridden.\n- Fully Interoperable: Solidity programs and WASM programs are completely composable. If working in Solidity, a developer can call a Rust program or rely on another dependency in a different language. If working in Rust, all Solidity functionalities are accessible out of the box. This means your Rust smart contracts can rely on primitives and infrastructure (such as oracles) that were built using Solidity.\n\nSeveral exciting teams have been building their apps on the Stylus testnet for the past few months. These apps would simply not be possible on Arbitrum without the added efficiency or new language support. Stylus can onboard (1) the next generation of developers from alternate VM ecosystems and (2) new use cases that users cannot experience on EVM chains.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community\u2019s mission and values:\n- Ethereum-Aligned: Stylus does not change anything about how the EVM works. Rather than replacing, Stylus is completely additive and extends what is possible in the EVM.\n- Sustainable: More efficiency at the execution layer can give Arbitrum chains long-term competitive advantages by allowing higher throughput, cheaper costs, and new use cases that are not possible on other EVM chains.\n- Accessibility: Arbitrum can become the home for new types of developers who don\u2019t know Solidity. This includes Rust, C, C++, and any other programming language that compiles to WebAssembly.\n- Inclusivity: The Stylus SDK is 100% open-source, meaning developers are free to fork, modify, and contribute to the core patterns that the SDK represents.\n- Empowerment: The parameters defined in Stylus are fully configurable by the Arbitrum DAO (for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) and individual Orbit chains. These customizations can supercharge Stylus by, for example, dropping activation prices, increasing contract size limits, and lowering opcode pricing.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nStylus: A new programming environment, including a WebAssembly-based virtual machine, a CLI, and a canonical SDK that defines the patterns and frameworks for writing smart contracts.\n\nWebAssembly (WASM): WebAssembly is a modern binary format used in significant web standards, browsers, and companies to speed up computation. Built to be fast, portable, and secure.\n\nVirtual Machine (VM): The software that executes smart contracts and processes transactions.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:\n\n- stylus: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro)\n  - Includes node software, VM, and Fraud Prover\n- stylus-geth: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/go-ethereum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum)\n  - Includes the execution client and databases\n- stylus-contracts: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts)\n  - Includes rollup and fraud proof smart contracts\n\nThe Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM. Instead, the two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. EVM contracts written in Solidity still use Geth\u2019s EVM exactly as before, ensuring EVM equivalence. In other words, Stylus is entirely additive \u2014 a paradigm called EVM+.\n\nStylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability. For example, existing Solidity DEXs can list Rust tokens without modification. New SDKs for additional programming languages can be added over time. Current SDK repositories:\n\n- Rust SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs: Rust Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs)\n- C/C++ SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c: C/C++ Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c)\n- Stylus CLI: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus: Cargo subcommand for developing Arbitrum Stylus projects in Rust](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus)\n\nIf you would like to better understand the lifecycle of a Stylus contract, head over to [A Gentle Introduction: Stylus](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction).\n\nThere are some relevant components of Stylus that are listed below:\n\n- Host I/Os\n- The Memory Model\n- Dynamic Learning\n- Activation Pricing\n- Opcode Pricing\n\nMore details on these components can be found in the corresponding [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts-arbos-30/22970), which is also linked below.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:\n\n1. Discussion of the proposal on the forum\n2. Completing the audit and remaining code changes\n3. Merging the Stylus branch into the canonical Nitro codebase\n4. A vote on Snapshot to enable Stylus on Arbitrum Sepolia\n5. Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet that emulates production environments\n6. An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova\n\n## Timeline\n\nStylus is rapidly progressing toward being production-ready. Once it is, ideally the upgrade can take place on Arbitrum Sepolia, and Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova afterwards. An onchain vote for this AIP will only occur once there is a public audit report.\n\nNOTE:\nIf this vote passes on Snapshot, the tentative plan is to upgrade Arbitrum Sepolia to ArbOS 30 the week of June 10th.\n\nIf Arbitrum Sepolia upgrades to ArbOS 30, there will be an ecosystem-wide plan to ensure non-breaking compatibility of infrastructure and applications with Stylus, which will take several weeks or months. The ultimate goal is that the experience for EVM developers remains as unchanged as possible if ArbOS reaches mainnet. Once enough confidence is reached, there will be an onchain vote to upgrade Arbitrum One and Nova to ArbOS 30. The Arbitrum community will be informed of any significant updates as they arise.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "a9c07d6f-b455-4bb3-a343-7a2c68448a93", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x6a1997509ef099f1b87984b6afdbbccf56c90e4377475b2ea43d027d5a1b10e9", "title": "Charm Finance LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0xAD16ebE6FfC7d96624A380F394cD64395B0C6144", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x6a1997509ef099f1b87984b6afdbbccf56c90e4377475b2ea43d027d5a1b10e9", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [97941970.35301869, 20560859.825883467, 2859776.411508195], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.635", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/charm-finance-ltipp-application-draft/21625\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nCharm Finance presented a solid application that scored well across alignment, security and general merits as their strategy targets growing the WBTC/WETH pie on Arbitrum. This application benefitted from being very straightforward in their plan and purpose. While we felt their milestone orientation were weak and grant ask was relatively high to their TVL, we are supportive of this endeavor to drive this liquidity/capital to Arbitrum. The grant ask is pretty small and feel the risk is worth pushing this to the DAO. \n\n*Karel Feedback*\n\"Vote AGAINST Charm Finance's proposal.\n\nWell-written proposal but the justification for grant size focused on a single vault that exceeds total amount of TVL on Arbitrum is insufficient. There's indeed a large market to be tapped into but it seems unrealistic that this will be possible for the duration of the grant.\"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe Charm Finance proposal aims to bring some of the 600 million in Mainnet Liquidity they have for their WETH/WBTC vault over to arbitrum using 55k of ARB. Given the relatively small ask of the grant and the need for more wBTC liquidity on Arbitrum I would be in support of this proposal. This incentive program's KPIs will depend on how much they can attract new users to the lower cost L2 environment. \n\nFor a fairly small grant this has the potential to deepen wBTC liquidity on Arbitrum and make it so users no longer need to leave the ecosystem to swap larger amounts. \n\n*GFX Feedback*\n\nThe request is small, the execution plan simple. This is at the upper bounds of what we consider appropriate for more experimental and speculative grants. We recommend approving this grant, as it scored well overall.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "aa28c03a-4991-4c97-97ca-10f8eb1876e4", "proposal_id": "5d7ceb2e-6ee9-4091-9604-48714389e3e8", "snapshot_id": "0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65", "title": "AIP: Nova Fee Router Proposal (ArbOS 30)", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-05-31 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-06-07 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [146841463.5937412, 109406.2271428643, 64553.515103075915], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-06-07 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.191", "body": "## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract / Motivation\n\nCurrently, the DAO receives transaction fees on Nova at an address accessible via the core governance system. This means that any time the DAO wishes to transfer these funds, it must pass a [constitutional proposal](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal). We propose instead a system in which these funds are \u201cautomatically\u201d (permissionlessly) sent from Nova to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One. This gives the DAO faster, easier accessibility to these funds, and should make bookkeeping simpler.\n\n## Details\n\nCurrently, the [portion of the Nova transaction fees](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/fee-distribution) that the DAO collects are sent via the [fund distributor contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts) to [0xf7951D92B0C345144506576eC13Ecf5103aC905a](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951D92B0C345144506576eC13Ecf5103aC905a), the [address alias](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) of the core governance l1 timelock. This allows the DAO to spend the funds via a [round-trip core proposal](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal) initiated from the core governor on Arbitrum One.\n\nA system in which these funds were sent to the DAO Treasury without the DAO needing to take action is preferable for several reasons:\n\n- Spending from the DAO treasury requires a lower quorum (3% vs. 5%)\n- Spending from the DAO treasury is faster (doesn\u2019t impose the additional ~ 2 weeks of delay\n- Keeping all fees in a single location makes bookkeeping simpler and easier to reason about.\n\nWe propose an update in which all Nova fund distributors that distribute to the timelock alias are updated to instead distribute to a system of \u201cfee routers\u201d, via which permissionless transactions will allow the funds to be routed to the Arbitrum Treasury.\n\nThe lifecycle works as follows:\n\n1. A distributeRewards is called on a RewardDistributor contract, sending funds to a ChildToParentRouter contract.\n2. Either upon receiving funds or via a call to routeFunds, the ChildToParentRouter creates an L2-to-L1 message which sends the contract\u2019s full Ether balance.\n3. The L2-to-L1 message is executed, transferring the Ether to a ParentToChildRouter contract on L1.\n4. routeFunds is called on ParentToChildRouter, creating a retryable ticket which transfers its full Ether balance to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- Fee Router contracts:\n  - Github link: [fund-distribution-contracts/src/FeeRouter at 61f4f60384e2ecba8250287dfb2778ce30bd82b0 \u00b7 OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts \u00b7 GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/tree/61f4f60384e2ecba8250287dfb2778ce30bd82b0/src/FeeRouter)\n  - Deployments:\n    - [ParentToChildRewardRouter | Address 0x3EB1F638C115F7dE148FAE18b8217e6c200c8657 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3EB1F638C115F7dE148FAE18b8217e6c200c8657)\n    - [ChildToParentRewardRouter | Address 0x47a85c0a118127f3968a6a1a61e2a326517540d4 | Arbiscan](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x47a85c0a118127f3968a6a1a61e2a326517540d4) \n  - Audit Link: [fund-distribution-contracts/audits at cb9ef7b5a5730fb9eb4bfdd2f9bc1f716a6e9253 \u00b7 OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts \u00b7 GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/tree/cb9ef7b5a5730fb9eb4bfdd2f9bc1f716a6e9253/audits)\n - Upgrade Action contract:\n   - [ArbOS30 AIP: add AIPNovaFeeRoutingAction by DZGoldman \u00b7 Pull Request #230 \u00b7 ArbitrumFoundation/governance \u00b7 GitHub](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/230)\n\n## Additional Action\n\nSometime after this proposal action, an additional proposal can be submitted to transfer the funds remaining in the timelock\u2019s address alias to the fee router.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf this vote passes on Snapshot, the tentative plan is to upgrade Arbitrum Sepolia to ArbOS 30 the week of June 10th.\n\nIf Arbitrum Sepolia upgrades to ArbOS 30, there will be an ecosystem-wide plan to ensure non-breaking compatibility of infrastructure and applications with Stylus, which will take several weeks or months.

Additionally, all other terms in bold in the diagram above, will be explained below.\n\n## Motivation\n\nA healthy Delegate Incentive Program is a requirement in any mature DAO that has actual onchain governance, and Arbitrum DAO is probably at a point where it cannot sustain itself without a program of this sort. The recent issues in [achieving quorum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dvp-quorum-for-arbitrumdao/29996) on proposals, and the lack of organic, community driven initiatives and proposals since the introduction of the [new vision in April](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-vision-for-the-future-of-arbitrum/28962/40), show that Arbitrum DAO clearly needs a program that incentivizes delegates adequately. This program should be designed to incentivize our community to show up, vote, and contribute to the DAO to the best of their abilities, and to attract new and talented members to our community.\n\nGiven how the [past versions of the program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dip-v1-6-from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-delegate-incentives-program/29475) evolved, and the [feedback](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dip-1-5-6-feedback-survey-results/29951) it generated, it is clear that the new delegate incentive program needs to be way more [predictable](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-revert-the-delegate-incentive-program-dip-to-version-1-5/29867), [objective](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-revert-the-delegate-incentive-program-dip-to-version-1-5/29867/40), [efficient](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-revert-the-delegate-incentive-program-dip-to-version-1-5/29867/2), and [attractive](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-revert-the-delegate-incentive-program-dip-to-version-1-5/29867/12).\n\nI\u2019m now sharing here on the forum this proposal for a new delegate incentive program with the intent to kick-start a public and open discussion and deliberation process about it. The goal is to have a new, more adequate version of the program in effect from November 2025 onwards. More importantly, to have a version of the program that is designed and shaped in the open, by the biggest and most diverse body of stakeholders possible.\n\nEDIT: [Curia](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/curia/summary) joined in on the program design, to contribute with the reward mechanism for the Second Dip and eventualy operationalize a live dashboard with the program results, given their relevant experience in other ecosystems.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis version of the Delegate Incentive Program, the ***Arbitrum Triple Dip***, is focused on **incentivizing 3 main outcomes**:\n\n1. that all offchain and onchain votes have a legitimate level of participation by consistently hitting quorum levels and rewarding voters that have good governance participation records;\n2. that all valuable and helpful feedback that delegates write on the forum gets rewarded for their helpfulness and engagement over time;\n3. that all manner of valuable organic contributions are rewarded in a fair and legitimate way so that we can attract and keep talented contributors in Arbitrum DAO.\n\nThese 3 main outcomes shaped the format, rules, and characteristics of this proposed Delegate Incentive Program and improve on the previous versions of this program, namely DIP 1.5, DIP 1.6, and the currently active DIP 1.7.\n\nIt also keeps certain characteristics of the previous versions of the Delegate Incentive Program, like the [public Delegate Application Process](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-1-7-application-thread-and-code-of-conduct-adherence/27969?u=paulofonseca) and adherence to the [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) in the Arbitrum DAO constitution, the [Community Guidelines](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807), and the DAO [Code of Conduct](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-dao-code-of-conduct/29713).\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Arbitrum Triple Dip Rules\n\nThis version of the Delegate Incentive Program, the Arbitrum Triple Dip, has the following rules, that we welcome all delegate feedback on, as presented in the illustrated process above:\n\n1. If in a given month, any offchain or onchain vote does have meaningful participation, aka, does not have more total casted voting power than the respective non-constitutional or constitutional quorum in effect at the time, nobody gets rewards, that month. (Except for \u201csocially cancelled\u201d onchain proposals)\n\n2. If in a given month, delegates don\u2019t vote on at least **[100%]** of offchain votes and on at least **[100%]** onchain votes, they don\u2019t get rewards, that month.\n\n3. If in a given month, delegates don\u2019t have more than **[500,000]** ARB in average voting power, they don\u2019t qualify for First Dip rewards, that month.\n\n4. First Dip rewards are fixed at **[30,000]** ARB per month, and fully distributed, proportionally, to the delegates that comply to the criteria 3 and 4 above.\n   a. For each delegate, the average of the casted voting power in all offchain and onchain votes in a given month, is used to compute the share of the First Dip rewards they receive. For example, if there are only 2 qualifying delegates, one with the higher voting power average of 9,000,000 ARB, and another one with the lower voting power average of 1,000,000 ARB, the first one receives 90% of the available First Dip amount, and the second one receives 10% of the available First Dip amount.\n\n5. If in a given month, delegates don\u2019t have more than **[50,000]** ARB in average voting power, they don\u2019t qualify for Second Dip rewards, that month.\n\n6. Each month, delegates should participate on the forum by commenting and \u2018Liking\u2019 others\u2019 valuable posts. Contributions are measured by the **Peer Recognition Score (PRS)**, which is designed to reward quality over quantity.\n   a. Instead of scoring the comments themselves, the **PRS** is based entirely on the \u2018Likes\u2019 your comments receive from your peers which weights based on your reputation or voting power. At the end of each month, the system will calculate the score by looking at all the \u2018Likes\u2019 received, which are then normalized across the different threads in the forum. This means that accumulating a high volume of comments won\u2019t improve your score; the goal is to make contributions that others find valuable enough to \u2018Like\u2019. For a full breakdown of the methodology, which is still being refined, please see the draft document [here](https://www.notion.so/curialab/Forum-Peer-Recognition-Score-Draft-v1-27d2dc1c1f798039ae44e70bfe7902d7?source=copy_link).\n\n7. Second Dip rewards are fixed at **[30,000]** ARB per month, and fully distributed, proportionally to their Peer Review Score, to the delegates that fulfil criteria 2, 5, and 6 above.\n\n8. If in a given **[quarter]**, delegates don\u2019t have more than **[5,000]** ARB in average voting power, they don\u2019t qualify for Third Dip rewards, that **[quarter]**.\n\n9. Every **[quarter]**, delegates enrolled in the program should post publicly, in a specific forum thread to be defined, up to **[5]** of their most impactful contributions each **[quarter]**, so that all enrolled delegates can evaluate the value of each other\u2019s contributions, by casting a **valid** weighted vote in a shielded offchain vote, like this example [contributor evaluation vote](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumdoubledip.eth/proposal/0x5744ce013531ba5856d91c927e9a4814dfc774f0f09c09396cbd4e8586a66e1b), on this [snapshot.box sub-space](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumtripledip.eth) with an allow-list based membership that reflects the enrolled delegates in the program, each **[quarter]**.\n   a. A **valid** casted vote, in this contributor evaluation vote, is one where the allow-listed delegates enrolled in the program don\u2019t vote for themselves. Any delegate that votes for themselves is excluded from Third Dip rewards.\n\n10. Third Dip rewards are fixed at **[120,000]** ARB per **[quarter]**, and fully distributed, proportionally, to the delegates that fulfill criteria 2, 8, and 9 above.\n   a. For each delegate, they will receive a share of the Third Dip rewards, proportional to the voting power that voted for them in the results of the *contributor evaluation vote*, given that they received more than **[10%]** of the voting power that the top delegate received. For example, if the highest voted delegate got 10,000,000 ARB voting for them, only delegates that got more than 1,000,000 ARB voting for them will get rewarded a share of the Second Dip rewards.\n\n11. There will need to be a maximum number of delegates rewarded by the program each **[quarter]**, for example **[50]** delegates, so that the total amount of reward per delegate is still enough to incentivize continuous contribution.\n\n12. All rewards are denominated and paid out in ARB. 1 ARB = 1 ARB.\n\n\n## Arbitrum Triple Dip Parameters\n\nRegarding the specific parameters values, the ones in **[square brackets]** both in the illustrated process and in the rules above, they are all up for further deliberation. These specific initially suggested values, mostly mimic the [August results](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dip-v1-7-delegate-incentive-program-results-august-2025/29977) of the 1.7 version of the currently active Delegate Incentives Program, assuming a $0.50 USD ARB price.\n\n* Minimum Monthly Offchain Vote Participation = **[100%]**\n   * this is a more demanding participation value than in the current DIP 1.7 because if we are going to pay delegates for voting, we should aim for delegates to have a perfect voting record.\n   * includes all votes on the arbitrumfoundation.eth Snapshot Space\n* Minimum Monthly Onchain Vote Participation = **[100%]**\n   * this is a more demanding participation value than in the current DIP 1.7 because if we are going to pay delegates for voting, we should aim for delegates to have a perfect voting record.\n   * includes all onchain votes in the Arbitrum Treasury Governor, all votes on the Arbitrum Core Governor, and all votes on the Security Council Governors\n   * excludes all \u201csocially cancelled\u201d onchain votes\n* Minimum Voting Power for First Dip Rewards = **[500,000]** ARB\n   * this mimics the current Tier X requirement of DIP 1.7\n* Fixed First Dip Monthly Rewards = **[30,000]** ARB\n   * this closely mimics the amount that was paid for Tier X delegates in the August DIP 1.7 results, assuming a $0.50 USD ARB price\n* Minimum Voting Power for Second Dip Rewards = **[50,000]** ARB\n   * this mimics the requirement to be eligible for rewards in DIP 1.5/6\n* Minimum Peer Recognition Score threshold = **[70]** points\n   * this is to ensure that only the highest quality comments are rewarded\n* Fixed Second Dip Monthly Rewards = **[30,000]** ARB\n   * this closely mimics the amount that was paid for Tier X delegates in the August DIP 1.7 results, assuming a $0.50 USD ARB price\n* Minimum Voting Power for Third Dip Rewards = **[5,000]** ARB\n   * this is to ensure that we have a bigger pool of contributors competing for these rewards\n* Time interval for Third Dip Contributor Evaluation rewards = **[quarter]**\n   * this is to ensure that delegates don\u2019t have to report, review and vote on the contributor evaluation vote too often\n* Maximum Reported Contributions per month = **[5]**\n   * so that delegates keep their monthly report of contributions concise, to be respectful of delegates\u2019 attention span, by prioritizing their most impactful contributions\n* Minimum Relative Contribution Cutoff = **[10%]**  of the voting power that the top delegate received on the monthly contributor evaluation vote results\n   * this is to establish a baseline of minimally valuable contributions, relative to the most valuable contribution each month.\n* Fixed Third Dip Monthly Rewards = **[120,000]** ARB\n   * this closely mimics the amount that was paid for Tier 1, 2, and 3 delegates in the August DIP 1.7 results, assuming a $0.50 USD ARB price\n* Maximum Number of Delegates Rewarded per month for First and Second Dip rewards = **[50]**\n   * this mimics the maximum amount of delegates to be rewarded on DIP 1.5/6/7\n\n## Retrospective comparison with DIP 1.7 results\n\n*(coming soon)*\n\n## Timeline of the Arbitrum Triple Dip Process\n\n![Cycle timeline.png](ipfs://bafkreih376qfygm3wg6lmac2hitxtkcuif3t2o45m2awpk7hdke3r56mzy)\nEvery **month**, delegates that have applied to the Arbitrum Triple Dip in that same month, and comply with the rules and parameters above, will be eligible for First Dip and Second Dip rewards.\n\nEvery **[quarter]**, delegates that have applied to the Arbitrum Triple Dip in that period, and comply with the rules and parameters above, will be eligible for Third Dip rewards.\n\nDuring this cycle, delegates can vote, comment, and contribute as they normally would, and then after that cycle ends, they should:\n\n* update their report with their top [5] most impactful contributions, between the 1\u02e2\u1d57 and the 5\u1d57\u02b0 of the following month, after the [quarter] ends.\n* vote, with a valid vote, in the contributor evalution vote in the specified snapshot space, between the 7\u1d57\u02b0 and the 14\u1d57\u02b0 of every month.\n\nThen, the Arbitrum Foundation and/or OpCo should process the payments in accordance to the rules and execute the First Dip and Second Dip payouts within 5 days, between the 1\u02e2\u1d57 and the 5\u1d57\u02b0 of every month, and execute the Third Dip payouts within 6 days, between the 14\u1d57\u02b0 and the 20\u1d57\u02b0 of the month after the **[quarter]** ending.\n\n### Process for delegates to apply to the Arbitrum Triple Dip\nAny delegate that wishes to be rewarded would need to apply to the Arbitrum Double Dip by posting their application to the forum, in a dedicated thread, similar to how it was done for version 1.5 on onwards of the DIP. All applications from DIP 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 will be grandfathered in the Arbitrum Double Dip.\n\n### Process for suspending or banning delegates from the Arbitrum Triple Dip\nOnly the Arbitrum Foundation or the OpCo can decide to suspend for 1 or more months, or ban a delegate from the Arbitrum Triple Dip. Affected delegates can appeal and revert the decision with an offchain vote that achieves a favorable vote of more than 3% of votable ARB tokens.\n\n### Process for changing the above Rules and Parameters\nAny delegate can initiate a proposal here in the forum, and the respective offchain vote to change any of the rules and parameters in the Arbitrum Triple Dip. Any change could never be done retroactively, and would only be considered a valid change if it achieves a favorable vote of more than 3% of votable ARB tokens.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIt depends on how the community receives this proposal. If this design for a Delegate Incentive Program is well received, we need to collaboratively define how to best implement this program in coordination with the relevant AAEs, namely the Arbitrum Foundation and OpCo.\n\nThe only operational thing that would be needed is to include the future Snapshot space for the contributor evaluation vote, as a sub-space of the [arbitrumfoundation.eth](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth) Snapshot space, so that it could inherit the Snapshot PRO benefits of our current subscription that are needed to correctly realize the contributor evaluaton vote, every [quarter].\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal aims for this version of the Delegate Incentive Program, the Arbitrum Triple Dip, to be in effect, from the month of November 2025 onwards.\n\nTo achieve that we should, in this order:\n\n1. agree on the **rules** of the next version of the Delegate Incentive Program\n   a. forum discussion, deliberation, and incorporation of delegate feedback until October 16\u1d57\u02b0\n   b. temperature check offchain vote to determine if the DAO wishes to invest in a Delegate Incentive Program with this design, from October 16th to October 23rd\n\n2. agree on the specific **parameters** of the next version of the Delegate Incentive Program\n   a. temperature check offchain vote to ratify the program and to determine the specific total budget available for the first experimental 2 quarters of the program, with an offchain vote that needs to achieve the non-constitutional quorum from October 23rd to October 30th\n\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nDepends on the reward amounts that are chosen in the final offchain temperature check vote. Will update this section of the proposal accordingly, as soon as there is consensus in the first temperature check vote and before the second, binding, offchain vote that needs to achieve the non-constitutional quorum to pass.\n\nAssuming the preliminary parameters defined above, that were picked to mimic the spending of the last month of August under the DIP 1.7 version, this version of the Delegate Incentive Program would distribute 1,200,000 ARB per year at $0.50 USD per ARB, with virtually 0 admin costs, assuming the OpCo and/or the Arbitrum Foundation would take care of the minimal admin required, which they are already doing for the DIP 1.7 version.\n\nAssuming this proposal passes, we will use the still available DIP 1.5/6/7 budget and multisig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "af1aeea6-57a4-4cad-bf58-357ec7c61df9", "proposal_id": "715a6847-ec6f-4a82-800d-fa69dd17086f", "snapshot_id": "0x07a26cd6b78a41745aab04190f22e97fdf9432f564651d0c4da0f8d0827888a6", "title": "Proposal: [Non-Constitutional] Funding for Into the Dungeons: Machinata - a PvP Digital Miniature Game V2", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x07a26cd6b78a41745aab04190f22e97fdf9432f564651d0c4da0f8d0827888a6", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-02-08 23:53:06", "voting_end": "2024-02-15 23:53:06", "options": {"scores": [32725534.89057588, 112352169.1097861, 4505575.437721903], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-02-15 23:53:06", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.836", "body": "# Abstract\n\nThis is a revised version of the initial proposal put forth to the DAO that can be found [here.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-funding-for-into-the-dungeons-machinata-a-pvp-digital-miniature-game/20806)\n\n## Summary\n\nWe have a lot to say about Into the Dungeons, a world we\u2019ve been building for over 2 years, however, in the interest of preserving the DAO\u2019s and delegates\u2019 time this summary will aim to provide a concise overview of:\n\n1.

This would be the first competitive e-sport like title in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe want to launch a playable version of Machinata during the 2nd half of 2024.\n\n## Our Ask\n\n**We are asking the DAO for 60,000 $ARB up front as a first tranche, and 180,000 $ARB in total. The rest of the 120,000 $ARB would be paid out in two tranches, 60,000 $ARB each.**\n\n**1. First tranche of 60,000 $ARB to enable us to deliver the following:**\n\n|Deliverable| Description|\n|--- | ---|\n|Into the Dungeons Branding, Website, and Marketplace Pt.1 \u2013 BRANDING AND DESIGN  | The ITD universe is expansive and will be much more than just one game. It will all live on Arbitrum.  We are aiming for a site at the level of KPR and have already had calls with the design agency that made the site.  The Marketplace is our first product \u2013 one where people will come to buy and sell their miniatures and so it needs to make an amazing impact.                                  |\n|Progress on Base Miniature Deck Pt.1 \u2013 7 ADDITIONAL CARDS | We currently have 5 cards completed and will be able to complete the rest of the cards with the funding. Each milestone will include delivery of 7 cards.                                |\n|UPDATED UNREAL ENGINE PROTOTYPE WITH 12 CARDS | The existing prototype has 4 cards integrated. We will integrate an additional 8 cards and release 2 small teaser scenarios for marketing purposes on our website that will be playable for free.  The DAO is welcome to try the full build at the time. |\n\n**2. After the milestones above have been met and confirmed by the DAO, we would ask for the next tranche of 60,000 $ARB which will enable us to meet the following milestones:**\n\n|Deliverable | Description|\n|--- | ---|\n|Into the Dungeons Branding, Website, and Marketplace Pt.2 \u2013 RELEASE OF MARKETPLACE | This second tranche will enable us to work with the design agency and release the completed website that will not only serve as an entry point to the ITD universe but will also include our first completed product \u2013 the Marketplace.  The Marketplace is where players will be able to purchase the Base Pack, Expansion, or Single Miniatures.  The Marketplace is also a key part of the sustainability of the game. By allowing community members to submit their designs/variants of Miniatures or completely new units, we will be enabling a creator economy that will generate revenue for artists, creators, and Machinata.                            |\n|Progress on Base Miniature Deck Pt.2 \u2013 7 additional cards completed | By the end of this milestone, we will have 19 cards completed.                              |\n|Smart Contracts | We will complete smart contracts for: 1.\tMinting miniatures (on behalf of the community creator, if a design is accepted) with their wallet receiving 70% of the proceeds and Machinata receiving 30% of the proceeds for each unit bought/sold. 2.\tSince miniatures are collectables, we want to enable collectors to trade them freely without paying us a percentage fee. However, if a miniature is traded to a player OTC, then to use it in the game, the player must register it with us by paying a small activation fee. 3.\tMatch History to be written on chain.                        |\n\n**3.\tThe final tranche of 60,000 $ARB will enable us to:**\n\n|Deliverable | Description|\n|--- | ---|\n|Begin Crowd sale of Base Game set (27 cards) + 1 PFP | With the previous two milestones completed, the last tranche will predominantly be used for launching our collection which will have an actual game tied to it!  We are currently contemplating 7777 packs with a percentage reserved for the Arbitrum community \u2013 See next section                      |\n|Initial Marketing and Partnerships | A lot of marketing and partnership money will be coming from the actual crowd sale as that will be key to making an impact in the Web3 space and bringing more users into the Arbitrum community to play Machinata and all the other cool games the community has been and will continue to build!|\n\nThis funding released over three tranches will allow us to speed up development and raise the rest of the capital required for longer term growth of the game that will include some features such as:\n1.\tStreamed competitions (similar to what Parallel did with their invitational)\n2.\tNew miniature packs being released\n3.\tNew game modes\n4.\tFurther development of the ITD ecosystem\n\n## Why Should the DAO Fund It?\nWe know asking for 60,000 $ARB upfront is a risk for the DAO, but here is why we think it is worth it.\n1.\tWe have a playable prototype \u2013 footage from in-engine (Unreal Engine) gameplay can be seen in the forum post.\n\n2.\tWe are making a high-quality digital miniature game that has been self-funded so far. Each miniature has an illustration, which is turned into a card and 5 animated pixel art sprites \u2013 some of these sprites can be seen in the forum post.\n\n3.\tWe have been active participants of the ecosystem for the last several years. Our first project https://www.ruffionreborn.xyz was self-funded and is completely opensource with all client side (Godot), server side and assets (CC0) being freely available for the Arbitrum community to make their own games. We are currently working on adding smart contracts to Ruffion Reborn.\n\n4.    We are doxxed builders and Arbitrum is home!\n[Ali Husain | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-husain1/)\n[Zehra Akbar | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zehra-akbar/)\n\n## How does the DAO Benefit?\n\nThe digital miniature model is not something that has been done yet in Web3. Games Workshop, the company behind Warhammer40K is currently valued at 4.15B USD. The concept of collectable digital miniatures with different editions, enabling artists to create variants and create a community powered economy is something that fits in very with NFT technology.\n\nWe are also creating some Arbitrum specific variants of miniatures. One example you can see in the forum post that the Soul Thief MUX variant placed alongside the Soul Thief Original Character.\n\nWe recognize that Arbitrum has a large and thriving De-Fi community and we want to involve and reward (even if it is a subset of) them for being a part of the ecosystem.\n\nA portion of the total supply (total supply will be 7777 1st edition packs, but the portion is TBD, likely 777 packs for the community) will be distributed to the Arbitrum community for free as a thank you for helping us build the game. We would like to work with the Arbitrum community via the DAO to figure out a fair distribution mechanism when we reach that point.\n\nMachinata\u2019s success is Arbitrum\u2019s success as the network will see more users come onboard and more transactions. Most importantly, a very high quality IP, native to Web3, native to Arbitrum.\n\nThank you,\n\nZehra & Ali\nForgotten Machine", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "afc7dc3d-44ba-465c-823d-9f5ff97c90d8", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x540cbc97de29a2d5888ba227be5d97b1c4992bb1b2547ccbfedfacc3a3c6bce0", "title": "Wombat Exchange STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x79C4213a328E3B4F1D87b4953C14759399dB25E2", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x540cbc97de29a2d5888ba227be5d97b1c4992bb1b2547ccbfedfacc3a3c6bce0", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [6932894.301944519, 55328531.23848561, 55261585.24686528], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.232", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

Running bi-weekly, each two-hour session creates a focused environment where protocols, developers, and ecosystem participants can gain insights, share experiences, and build lasting connections. The sessions surface hidden expertise within the community and provide a structured space for peer-led support.\n\nThis series is a direct response to findings from the AVI Pilot\u2019s [ecosystem investment thesis,](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/avis-ecosystem-investment-thesis-and-its-ethos/28131) which emphasizes the importance of empowering skilled builders to become leaders within the ecosystem. By creating a scalable peer support network, we can create an environment that\u2019s less dependent on direct engagement with any one expert group.\n\nSessions include breakout discussions, expert clinics, and guided workshops, ensuring participants receive actionable guidance while expanding Arbitrum\u2019s network of skilled builders. By surfacing and rewarding community expertise, the Growth Circle creates a self-sustaining support system that drives long-term ecosystem growth.\n\nSome examples of session topics include:\n\n* Orbit Chains: Is it the right fit and when to deploy\n* Go To Market Clinic\n* Strategic Relationship Development with Institutional Stakeholders\n\n# Event Organizer\n\n[Farstar](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/avi-meet-the-farstar-team/28159), the group behind the [Arbitrum Ventures Initiative](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-ventures-initiative-hub/26008), has successfully executed similar programs at large-scales across 10+ countries, managing parallel teams and an annual events budget in excess of $1.5M+. We\u2019ve been recognised for our work in startup communities like the Royal Academy of Engineering in the UK and alongside the likes of Oxford University and Imperial College.\n\nAs the direct event organizer, our team will handle all aspects of:\n\n* Participant curation and engagement\n* Event design and execution\n* Session facilitation\n* Insight tracking and documentation\n* Post-event analysis and reporting\n\n# Benefits of the Event to Arbitrum\n\nThe Arbitrum Growth Circle creates a scalable solution for the growing demand for direct support within the ecosystem. This aligns closely with AVI\u2019s goals of empowering entrepreneurs to act as leaders within the ecosystem and serves as a natural continuation of the flywheel effect started by the AVI Pilot.\n\n* **Scalable Support:** Streamlines expertise sharing, lowers bottleneck effects, while empowering community-driven problem-solving and knowledge sharing within the ecosystem.\n\n* **Ecosystem Growth:** Accelerates onboarding, expands access to market makers and liquidity providers by helping protocols to understand how to engage them and drives adoption of Arbitrum.\n\n* **Market Connections:** Bridges gaps between loosely connected community members and establishes direct support-related feedback loops.\n\n* **Empowering Community:** Elevates emerging experts, fosters peer-led problem-solving, and builds a sustainable mentor network.\n\n# Proposed Budget\n\nTotal Budget: $67.2k USD\n\n### Budget Breakdown\n\n* Growth Circle Clinics: $15k\n  * 7 clinics with 3 facilitators\n* Marketing and Participant Recruitment: 12k\n  * Onboarding prep and execution\n  * Graphic design\n  * Execution of the Marketing Plan described below\n* 1:1 Support: 7k\n  * Over 60 one-on-one support sessions\n* Program Design and Development: 10k\n  * Conceptual development of the program\n  * Participant journey design\n  * Creation of templates and session formats\n* Reporting and DAO Engagement: 9.6k\n  * Bi-weekly updates\n  * Post-event impact report\n  * Delegate engagement from pre-conceptual state to final report\n* Unconference: 13.6k\n  * Event preparation\n  * Pre-curation of sessions\n  * Engaging session hosts\n  * Facilitation\n### Budget Tracking\nWe have extensive experience running similar events and have established budget tracking processes to ensure funds are used effectively to maximize impact while maintaining financial integrity.\n\n# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n| KPI | Target | Tracking Method |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| Net Promoter Score      | Target +50     | Post-session surveys of all participants     |\n| Qualitative  | At least 5 specific impact stories published in the report. **Usually time needs to allow for these to materialize. Meaning might be expanded within 3 months after the final event.* | Qualifying anecdotes from surveys and conversations clearly demonstrating both impact and attribution to our intervention in alignment to the logic model \n| Consistent Attendance and Participation | Maintain a core cohort of at least 20 \u2018activated\u2019 participants, who attend at least 1/3 of the events | Have the program manager track registered people, attendees during the sessions and engagement with surveys. \n| Network development | 50%+ | % of \u2018activated\u2019 participants report that they have met their original relationship development target, because of the event series as measured by entry and exit surveys (Eg with investors, market makers, partners, employees. Activated means they have participated in over \u2153 of the available sessions). | \n\nAll of these metrics are meant to align with a [Theory of Change and Logic Model](https://link.farstar.co/883dee) ultimately demonstrating how we are driving Primary Outcomes such as Orbit and Stylus adoption, more protocols launching on Arbitrum, more token launches, more high quality sticky liquidity on Arbitrum One and Orbits. \n\n# Event Logistics\nThis will be a virtual-first event with in-person participation at major conferences our team is attending (eg. ETH Denver, EthCC). The Farstar team will handle all online logistics, including Zoom webinars, Miro boards, worksheets, and Gathertown coordination.  \n### Format & Timeline\n#### Hybrid Model:\n\n**1. ETH Denver:** On-ground curation to identify & onboard protocols\n\n**2. Seven Virtual Clinics** across 2\u20133 months. Each session ~2 hours, featuring expert presentation + interactive \"live coaching.\u201d An example of a virtual clinic is \u201cBuilding Effective Market Maker Relationships\" which includes:\n\n* **30min Expert Panel:** Leading market makers share their best practices and common pitfalls\n* **60min Interactive Workshop:** Participants break into small groups (2-3 teams) with experienced mentors to workshop their specific liquidity challenges\n* **30min Community Solutions:** Teams present their refined strategies, getting real-time feedback from peers and experts\n* **Post-Session:** Teams implement learnings \u2192 Track measurable outcomes \u2192 Share success stories in follow-up sessions \u2192 Successful teams become future mentors  \n\n**3. Unconference:** Invite only for select protocols becoming part of the Arbitrum Growth Circle\n\n* **Breakout in pre-curated streams:** Full day event with 3 to 5 tracks, 4 to 7 35-min sessions each, with 2 planning sessions, optimised so a participant can join for the full or half of the event.\n* **Participation of key experts**\n* **Focus on pre-seeded \u2018community heroes\u2019:** with them lead the knowledge sharing and Arbitrum expert guests being positioned as equal knowledge peers playing a supporting role\n* **Focus on relationship building:** Specifically introducing builders with industry peers, rather than promising them direct collaboration with any one expert group.\n\n# Service Providers Required\nNo external service providers needed. \n# Support Required\n\nThe Arbitrum Growth Circles naturally align with the community engagement efforts from AVI Phase 1, allowing us to seed participation through referrals even without formal support from the DAO or ADPC. However, reaching a broader audience\u2014including DAO contributors who can share their expertise\u2014will further strengthen the initiative. To achieve this, we will request marketing support from ADPC, amplification from AF through retweets and promotion in relevant Arbitrum Telegram groups.    \n# Timeline\n\nProvide a detailed execution timeline and key milestones assuming the proposal is approved.\n<details>\n<summary>Pre-launch Phase (Weeks 1-2)</summary>\n\n* **IRL Engagement & Onboarding**\nThe Farstar team will use ETH Denver as a key touchpoint to connect, onboard, and mobilize relevant participants. Many meetings with relevant participants have already been scheduled through AVI. And the Farstar team is running office hours on the 1st of March on the Arbitrum booth in the main venues.\n\n   Furthermore we will rally participants for an Arbitrum builder gathering around any event where there might be an overlap of attendance and our team is present (e.g. ETH Bucharest). \n\n   Most importantly, we will conclude in EthCC in Cannes where we expect a large presence. This is an opportunity to aid Arbitrum Growth Circle participants in mobilizing each other toward achieving shared goals.\n* **Session Development & Participant Curation**\nWhile AVI has provided a strong foundation through prior discussions with dozens of participants, additional outreach and effort will be required to engage new stakeholders and refine session topics to align with emerging interests.\n* **Speaker & Mentor Coordination**\nWe will collaborate closely with speakers/mentors to align on session formats, securing speakers, and optimizing knowledge-sharing opportunities.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Launch Phase (Week 3)</summary> \n\n* **Twitter Space Kickoff:** We\u2019ll hold a Twitter space announcing the series and showcasing the purpose of the initiative, demonstrating empathy with the community and commitment on the side of Arbitrum to offer support and respond to emerging needs. \n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Clinic Series (Weeks 4-12)</summary> \n\n* **Conduct Series:** The series will run bi-weekly, culminating in a final evaluation session to assess impact, gather feedback, and discuss next steps.\n</details>\n\n<details> \n<summary>Post-Event Phase (Weeks 13-14)</summary>\n\n* **Post-Event Documentation & Impact Report:** All remaining materials will be compiled and shared publicly on the Arbitrum Forum, alongside a detailed Impact Report summarizing key outcomes and insights.\n</details>\n\n# Communication Plan\n\n<details>\n<summary>Pre-Event Communication</summary>\n\n* **Announcements:** Posts on the Arbitrum Forum, Discord, and Telegram to build awareness.\n* **Participant Outreach:** Direct engagement with protocol teams, developers, and key ecosystem members.\n* **Speaker Coordination:** Private channels for logistics, pre-event briefings, and shared event materials.\n</details>\n\n<details> \n<summary>During the Series</summary>\n\n* **Forum Updates (1-2 per mo):** Session highlights, key takeaways, and upcoming topics.\n* **Session Summaries:** Recaps posted on the forum and shared in Discord/Telegram.\n* **Engagement Tracking:** Monitor participation, adjust formats, and encourage re-engagement as needed.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Post-Event Communication</summary>\n\n* **Impact Report:** Participation data, key insights, and recommendations for future iterations.\n* **Community Feedback:** Open to discuss and evaluate the response to the event.\n* **Resource Compilation:** Public archive of session recordings, key takeaways, and additional learning materials.\n</details>\n\n# Marketing Plan\n### Target Audience Outreach\nOur primary focus is high-potential protocols that are relatively new to building in the Arbitrum ecosystem or are currently underserved. To reach them, we will:\n* **Targeted Outreach \u2013** Leverage a subset of the 60+ protocols and 25+ fund managers from the AVI market consultations, prioritizing those most relevant.\n* **Direct Engagement \u2013** Engage directly with protocols we have strong rapport with, ensuring they understand the event\u2019s benefits and alignment with their goals.\n* **Referral Network \u2013** Ask each participant to refer 2-3 others who could benefit, expanding reach organically and identifying existing communities to empower ambassadors.\n* **Participant Database \u2013** Utilize our 500+ participant longlist from AVI, including metadata on DAO and AF grant recipients, to identify relevant participants and seek introductions.\n* **Channel Activation \u2013** Tap into available channels from ADPC, AF, and DAO, along with possible engagement from X (Twitter), Arbitrum Discord, and community forums, without relying on them as primary outreach.\n### Content Strategy\nRegular promotional content and participant success stories to maintain visibility and drive engagement. Updates will be shared via the **Arbitrum Forum** (structured updates), **Twitter/X** (broader reach), **Discord** (direct interaction), and additional relevant channels.\n</details>\n\n# Alignment with Arbitrum\u2019s Mission, Vision, and Purpose\nThe Arbitrum Growth Circle directly advances Arbitrum's mission by:\n1.

This approach can be distilled into three separate phases:\n\n1. Achieving wide-reaching agreement on why the Arbitrum DAO exists and what it is trying to accomplish. In other words, what is the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s mission, vision, and purpose. The MVP is purposefully simple and unambiguous such that it is absolutely clear what the DAO is ultimately working towards, with additional complexity only introduced when strategic goals to reach the end state are created. Without an agreed upon north star, it is impossible to evaluate how one-off strategies and initiatives assist the DAO to reach its goals, simply because there is currently a wide set of different opinions on what the DAO is striving to achieve. Additionally, most\u2014if not all\u2014initiatives and strategies are evaluated in isolation without considering how they play into wider frameworks. While the MVP might feel too abstract, its purpose is to enable more complexity to be stacked on top of it through iterative efforts.\n\n2. Once the DAO\u2019s end state goals have been solidified, anyone will have the opportunity to propose a strategy matrix made up of 12- and 24-month focus areas for the DAO through an open process named Strategic Objective Setting (SOS). These areas should have well-established guidelines for tangible implementation and what they aim to accomplish, as well as only have one purpose\u2014optimally moving the DAO towards its end state. This is the step that will allow the DAO to refocus its attention on the most critical deliverables and judge how one-off initiatives fit into its short- to medium-term priorities. Entropy Advisors is working on the SOS proposal in tandem with the MVP, and it will be posted as a subsequent separate proposal with the DAO choosing one matrix of strategies as the winner.\n\n3. Combined with financial forecasting, the SOS will enable the DAO to budget itself for the next 12/24 months by earmarking capital to each strategic focus area ratified in step 2. Arguably, the most important aspect of this step is for the DAO to align on how profitable/loss-making it wants to be during the coming year(s). Lastly, with clearly defined strategic focus areas, it should also become simpler for the DAO to begin marketing its efforts since, e.g., a clear identity, as well as narratives, can be built around each of the DAO\u2019s focus areas.\n\n![MVP image 1.png](ipfs://bafkreihzcndqv6am5ba2uqx3nnecirushrkktinzlbrqkn46spaxu3767i)\n\nWhen it comes to this proposal, we\u2019ve strived to distill numerous key stakeholders\u2019 and delegates\u2019 thoughts and ideas into a cohesive mission, vision, and purpose for the Arbitrum DAO, presented below. It\u2019ll naturally be impossible to align all DAO participants on the DAO\u2019s end state goals because of the ecosystem\u2019s diversity. However, for this exercise to be successful, the passed Mission, Vision, and Purpose must have buy-in from a clear majority of the DAO and cannot be unilaterally pushed forward.\n\nAfter looking into other ecosystems, we concluded that [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355) currently has the best-suited mechanism to strategically define objectives in a decentralized and efficient manner, which is why we are striving to implement a program for Arbitrum that takes influence from Lido. We thank Lido DAO contributors who set a great example of how decentralized governance should go about this exercise.\n\n## Call to Action\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO\u2019s Guiding Principles are as Follows:\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\n![MVP Image 2.png](ipfs://bafybeieolo4gzttjfxjoa3rv5werhlpfdo36cagyniy7jqzhbcbmcizkci)\n\n\n## Motivation + Rationale\n\nThe current lack of defined mission, vision, purpose, and strategic objectives today has created a notable, twofold inefficiency in the DAO:\n\n1. Each organization operating in the DAO must extrapolate for itself what it should work towards that contributes the most value to Arbitrum. Questions arise such as:\n* Should my organization work toward enabling operational sustainability and painting a picture of ARB as a productive asset?\n* Growth of the technology stack:\n    i. Orbit?\n    ii. Stylus?\n    iii. Arbitrum One?\n* What role should public goods have within Arbitrum?\n\nWith a lack of clear strategic focus areas, being an effective DAO operator becomes difficult. Redundant and conflicting work turn into a reality due to a lack of alignment and organizational structure.\n\n2. The absence of concrete goals has made it challenging for the DAO to judge the effectiveness of initiatives. A system has been created where all the DAO can effectively do is judge \u201cDid this organization work hard\u201d but lacks the ability to judge \u201cDid this organization do a good job moving Arbitrum forward towards its end state goals.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, a clear vision is required for the DAO to pursue its own brand and marketing strategies. It is time to align on this vision. If Arbitrum DAO executes its mission successfully, what does Arbitrum\u2019s place in the world look like? What are the ecosystem and its numerous contributors (the DAO and its programs, the Foundation, and development teams) working towards? What sets Arbitrum apart from competitors?\n\nThe goal of the MVP proposal is to align the DAO on the highest level of purpose, enabling the subsequent SOS to build on top of it and function as a framework through which delegates and key stakeholders can propose and choose a set of concrete short- and mid-term goals for Arbitrum DAO. This approach helps ease Entropy's concerns with our [initial approach](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-dao-s-vision-mission-and-goals/26537), where the proposal promised everything under the sun as it continually expanded with more (and sometimes conflicting) opinions into the mix. Additionally, we believe our original desire to set out on a 5-year plan left too much room for ambiguity without tangible steps to be taken.\n\nThus, the scope has been reduced. Even within the objectively high-level MVP proposal herein, there are still likely to be areas of contention, such as whether Arbitrum should align with Ethereum more closely, whether the DAO should put a greater emphasis on its flagship Arbitrum One product, and whether the delegates will actually feel empowered to use the MVP as a driving force for their actions.\n\nThe MVP will be the foundation for most actions taken by the Arbitrum DAO going forward, especially when it comes to short- to medium-term strategy setting and budgeting. It is a document that will help drive the DAO, protocol, token, and ecosystem into the foreseeable future and directly inform decisions surrounding new proposals and initiatives.\n\n## Diving In\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem. \n\nDriving Question: Why does Arbitrum DAO exist?\n\n* Why is Arbitrum DAO developing all of the products and initiatives with the design decisions it is?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO\u2019s purpose is to **Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem.**\n\nArbitrum is not just scaling tech, it scales L1s without concessions to censorship resistance, accessibility, decentralization, or security. A crucial component of the DAO\u2019s existence is to defend these ideals. For its governed chains, Arbitrum DAO ensures that there is no single point of control, can eliminate rent-seeking intermediaries, and most importantly, users maintain control of their assets without trusting an entity. In order to defend Arbitrum into perpetuity, the DAO requires sustainable operations and funding mechanisms, which will be further expanded on in the Vision section below. \n\nAccording to the [blockchain trilemma](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/vision/), to scale and accommodate more throughput and users, L1s require trade-offs in terms of either security or decentralization. Making concessions to decentralization or security is not an option for Ethereum mainnet, leading to a chain that even with today\u2019s limited number of onchain participants becomes prohibitively expensive for most users. Arbitrum DAO\u2019s purpose, true to Vitalik\u2019s [rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), is to scale L1s while defending security and decentralization. \n\nThe second portion of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s purpose is to guide the ecosystem. Guiding the Arbitrum ecosystem refers to every aspect of what Arbitrum offers, whether it be Arbitrum One, Orbit\u2019s ecosystem of chains, or DAO-funded programs. At a high level, guiding encompasses two areas: growing and stewarding. Growing Arbitrum One is achieved by creating the best environment for builders, supporting their apps, bringing in more users and awareness to the value One provides, and ensuring alignment between builders and Arbitrum DAO. The same applies to Arbitrum\u2019s Orbit chains. Sustainable growth is at the core of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s purpose, and the DAO should view its role with respect to growth from a lens of continuing for 100s if not 1000s of years.\n\nStewarding the ecosystem relies on guiding the path forward for Arbitrum upgrades, new products, and funding decisions. In the world of Arbitrum, the DAO is in control, and that means making informed decisions that optimally move the ecosystem forward in an unceasing and durable way. The DAO is in charge of calling the shots for the future of Arbitrum. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\nDriving Question: What is Arbitrum DAO doing to achieve its purpose?\n\n* What activities is it executing in practice that lead to its reason for existence being achieved?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO\u2019s mission is to **Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.**\n\nArbitrum DAO\u2019s mission is to empower people with the sovereignty to build what they want, code in their preferred language, execute without barriers, and create without needing permission\u2014embracing true onchain freedom. However, building one's best onchain world does not just apply to developers, but equally to users, creators, and DAO contributors.\n\nArbitrum gives builders the freedom to develop on their own terms. \u201cYour chain, Your rules.\u201d This includes, among other things, allowing for self-governed rollups (not forcing ARB into the design) and supporting multiple languages. Arbitrum stands out in being the best and most robust scaling tech, but also in forward-thinking design decisions that enable it to be the primary home for builders by giving freedom and flexibility to its development community.\n\nThe most important aspect of enabling the best onchain world is achieved through Arbitrum continuing to build a full-featured tech stack that includes battle-tested permissionless proving, forced inclusion, custom gas tokens, multi-language support, interoperability, MEV solutions, and much more. True to its purpose, the best onchain world with Arbitrum has security at its core.\n\nEmpowering rollup and application developers to leverage the best-in-class technology stack without restrictions will establish network effects and, importantly, a unified narrative that ties together the rest of the ecosystem, creating an environment that attracts new builders across a wide set of verticals to Arbitrum. This in turn enables Arbitrum to be the primary destination for compelling blockspace, defined as a blockchain\u2019s ability to attract users through the utility it provides. For a rollup to be compelling, it must have sought-after blockspace, which can only be achieved in one way: Attracting great apps. We don't just aim to create blockspace that maintains Ethereum's core values, we aim to create blockspace that people want to use. Attracting builders is one of the most crucial pieces to Arbitrum\u2019s mission. While crypto has many amazing apps, compelling blockspace is the key that will enable crypto to break into magnitudes more users in the future. Today, Arbitrum One is the most compelling rollup in crypto and the DAO\u2019s flagship product, and that is an achievement we must continue to support at all costs. That said we must not lose sight that on a long time horizon, the ecosystem will also expand through complimentary Orbit chains.\n\nWhen it comes to end-users, creators, and DAO contributors, Arbitrum DAO\u2019s mission to empower people with freedom can be quantified in two notable ways:\n1. Being part of a wider, resonating collective movement generates a certain degree of loyalty, excitement, and alignment that is difficult to quantify, yet crucial in driving long-term, sustained engagement and new contributions.\n2. Freedom is attributed to the ability to pick and choose from a wide selection of applications and infrastructure-level solutions, creating a package of services tailored to specific requirements. Arbitrum offers flexibility to meet diverse priorities and utility functions\u2014whether users value security, privacy, low costs, etc., the ecosystem adapts to support them all. Arbitrum is building to be the one-stop shop where end users, creators, and DAO contributors are equipped to effortlessly perform anything that\u2019s achievable on a blockchain without constraints.\n\nIn order to reach the aforementioned goals, it is of the utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO runs sustainable operations with revenue. Without sustainability, it will be impossible for the DAO to continue supporting the building out of the best scaling tech, pushing forward an ecosystem attracting the best builders, and providing end users, creators, and DAO contributors with an empowering, collaborative, and personalized environment. A pivotal part of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s mission is ensuring that all highly adopted Arbitrum-based rollups and apps create revenue for the DAO, maintaining alignment between the ecosystem and token.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\nDriving Question: What is the end state goal for Arbitrum that the DAO is striving to achieve?\n\n* Where is Arbitrum\u2019s place in the world after the DAO achieves all it has set out to do?\n\nAnswer: **Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.**\n\nWith the most full-featured tech stack and compelling (sought-after) blockspace in crypto on Arbitrum stack rollups, users and builders from all walks of life and verticals will have flocked into the Arbitrum ecosystem. New users\u2019 first onboarding experience in crypto will be through an Arbitrum rollup, while the default choice for developers will be to deploy on an Arbitrum technology stack-enabled chain. In a world where financial transactions happen onchain, the majority will take place on Arbitrum blockspace.\n\nArbitrum DAO will function as a resilient flywheel. The best tech stack together with robust ecosystem support will increasingly attract builders and notable enterprises who create and enable applications that onboard more users into the ecosystem. Profits accruing to the DAO from users leveraging Arbitrum\u2019s blockspace will bolster network security and also be reinvested in a sustainable and diversified manner. Sequencing and licensing fees will be reinforced by acquiring ownership interests that help expand the ecosystem (intangible) and enable value accrual (tangible). The DAO will function with some similarities to a conglomerate, leveraging investments to create an even more robust application and infrastructure layer, directly strengthening its core product, which again will produce increasing returns that can be used to strengthen network security through ARB and to support new growth.\n\n![MVP Image 3.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeie47gxhymgnzlpwh5p7v24s6fhwlbc3ai3dff7jcbykkadfn2jema)\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\nIt took multiple months of conversations with stakeholders to really get a sense of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s future but Entropy Advisors is very happy with the potential for this new process. While much of this proposal is not directly actionable, we believe that it is the necessary first step in moving forward with Arbitrum DAO\u2019s future strategic plans. We look forward to making final modifications to the MVP based on the DAO\u2019s feedback. It is worth noting that it is not possible for the MVP to serve everyone's desires because it would end up with contradictions, but it\u2019s important that it is a document that the DAO can get behind and feel empowered to use.\n\nThe subsequent SOS (Strategic Objective Setting) proposal will be the next step in this exercise, in which anyone will be able to create 12- and 24-month actionable strategic goals for the DAO. The SOS will be posted shortly after the MVP. If approved, it will include a 14-day notice period and 30-day submission window, in which any contributor can submit a strategy matrix of concrete strategic objectives aligned with the MVP. These workstreams could then be budgeted, creating a new paradigm for operational structure in the DAO.\n\n## Expected Timeline\n\n1. Dec 9th: final version of MVP forum period requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions. Will be extended if necessary.\n3. Dec 12th: Snapshot to signal approval/disapproval/abstention of MVP (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d).\n4. Late Dec / Early Jan: SOS posted\n5. Entropy Advisors plans to take the MVP to a constitutional vote, adding it as language to the constitution, after a 6-month trial period. During the initial 6 months, changes can be made to the MVP via a proposal+Snapshot vote, but after being included in the constitution, would require a constitutional onchain amendment. It is our belief that the current MVP is broad enough to handle substantial changes in the crypto market.\n\nA huge thank you to @castlecapital, @maxlomu, and all the other contributors who dedicated considerable time and effort to provide us with valuable feedback on this exercise.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "b2b7b5cd-b6c0-4caf-aba5-490696f80663", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xb8798bb81535a45813f55d07fcc030ac003a450b7b8177c16972cd37f60211bc", "title": "Jones DAO STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x79C4213a328E3B4F1D87b4953C14759399dB25E2", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb8798bb81535a45813f55d07fcc030ac003a450b7b8177c16972cd37f60211bc", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [199095833.21221083, 3962638.653959124, 1047851.4743291034], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.194", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

Timeboost enables auctions for the rights to an express lane, giving the winner a time advantage for transaction inclusion and allowing them to potentially capture arbitrage and backrunning opportunities. Proceeds from the auction are at the discretion of the Arbitrum DAO, with two main options outlined in this proposal: collecting bids in ETH or collecting bids in ARB.\n\n## Motivation\n\nArbitrum Chains currently order transactions on a First-Come First-Served basis (FCFS). The motivation to implement FCFS was threefold:\n\n1. Easy to understand and implement,\n2. Replicate Web2 user experience for instant transaction confirmation,\n3. Protect users against front-running,\n\nUnfortunately, relying solely on first-come first-served transaction ordering is not an ideal long-term solution.\n\nWhen opportunities to profitably arbitrage across exchanges arise on Arbitrum, \u201cMEV Searchers\u201d race to get their transaction included before anyone else so that they can capture this profit. This latency race involves a lot of spam, placing stress on chain infrastructure and causing searchers to wastefully invest in faster hardware. Furthermore, none of the MEV generated is captured by the chain and instead all profits are collected by searchers.\n\nTimeboost is a new transaction ordering policy that retains many of the great benefits currently in place for Arbitrum chains, including frontrunning protection and fast block times, while allowing the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n## Rationale\n\n**Sustainable**: Timeboost offers the ArbitrumDAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users, since the value being captured already exists.\n\n**Technically-Inclusive**: Rather than capturing arbitrage opportunities by having the fastest hardware, participants can win these opportunities by bidding in an auction.\n\n**Neutral and Open**: The auction for the express lane is permissionless and participation is open to everyone, where the highest bid wins.\n\n**Empowerment**: The Arbitrum DAO can configure all aspects of Timeboost, including enabling or disabling it, the auction\u2019s design, and how to handle proceeds.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n**Express Lane**: A separate path for submitting transactions to the sequencer that has priority access compared to normally submitted transactions.\n\n**MEV**: Maximal extractible value. In the context of Timeboost, MEV refers to the maximum amount of profit someone could make by including their transactions slightly faster than anyone else.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe full specification for the Timeboost auction can be found here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design.\n\nThe implementation consists of an auction contract and autonomous auctioneer:\n\n* **Auction contract** - Prospective bidders must deposit funds into the auction contract before bidding in the auction. The contract is also responsible for verifying bidders\u2019 signatures, checking auction contract account balances, deducting the second-highest bid amount from the account of the highest bidder, and handling the proceeds.\n* **Autonomous auctioneer** - An offchain program that receives bids from participants and resolves the top two bids to the auction contract. This AIP proposes that the current sequencer operator provision and set up the autonomous auctioneer, if Timeboost is adopted.\n\nTimeboost changes the guarantees around transaction submission and introduces two different paths:\n\n* **Normal path** - Transactions in the normal path will experience a short delay (defaulted to 200ms), but will otherwise remain unchanged.\n* **Express lane** - Transactions in the express lane do not experience any delay.\n\nNearly all users will continue to submit transactions using the normal path. Timeboost introduces an express lane that can be purchased by sophisticated actors (like searchers) via an auction every minute, with each auction closing 15 seconds before the next round begins.\n\nAll bids in the auction are kept private until after the bid submission deadline and the auction winner will pay the same price as the second-highest bid of that round. A bid will only be accepted if it is at or above a minimum bid (the `reservePrice`). The autonomous auctioneer has the right to change the `reservePrice`, but it cannot be lower than the `minReservePrice`, which can only be changed by the ArbitrumDAO. Note, the `reservePrice` does not represent the expected value of a bid for the express lane, it is just a minimum bid that will be accepted.\n\nWe propose setting the `minReservePrice` to either 0.001 ETH or 3 ARB depending on which currency the DAO votes to collect bids in.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO can configure the currency in which bids are collected and how the remaining 97% of auction proceeds are handled. This AIP proposes two main options that the community can vote on if it decides to adopt Timeboost. Governance can change these options at any time.\n\n* **Collect ETH** - Collect bids in ETH and send the proceeds to the DAO treasury.\n* **Burn ARB** - Collect bids in ARB and burn the proceeds.\n\nDepending on which option the Arbitrum DAO chooses, the auction contract can either transfer the proceeds to a designated account or burn them.\n\nThe following data sources will eventually be saved and made available after Timeboost goes live on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, if this proposal passes:\n\n* Historical bid data for auction participants, outside of the two highest bids (that are otherwise posted on-chain)\n* A way to label/identify which transactions were sequenced in the express lane (i.e. Timeboosted transactions).\n\nFinally, the proposed version of Timeboost is compatible with a centralized sequencer. However, the Timeboost policy will also be compatible with proposals for a decentralized sequencer. 3% of auction proceeds would be set aside for the Arbitrum Developer Guild, which helps fund core Arbitrum development.\n\n## Timeboost Implementation Adjustments\n\n[Timeboost\u2019s design](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design) is the culmination of over a year of research and development by the team at Offchain Labs. While the on-chain implementation will be independently audited by Trail of Bits before the Tally vote, the long term performance of Timeboost can only truly be evaluated with real-world data - data that can help hone and fine-tune Timeboost\u2019s design for the benefit of the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nTo that end, although the auctioneer will function autonomously, **this AIP proposes granting the current sequencer operator the below rights to make the following adjustments from time to time for a period of two (2) years.** The rights described below are expected to only be exercised in circumstances **where doing so would enhance Timeboost\u2019s long-term stability, preserve or improve the user experience for those using Timeboost-enabled Arbitrum chains, increase the security posture, resiliency, or stability of the chain, and/or otherwise help increase revenue for the ArbitrumDAO**:\n\n* The right to adjust the `NonExpressDelayMsec` parameter, which is the default delay that non-express lane transactions would be subject to. The default is 200ms, but adjustments could be to any value between 100ms & 500ms, inclusive.\n* The right to change the `maxBidsPerSenderInRound` parameter, a limit on the number of bids per participant per auction round, to mitigate against active or perceived Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the auctioneer. The starting default will be 5.\n* The right to change the `reservePrice` to respond quickly to opportunities to increase the DAO revenue from Timeboost bid proceeds and/or to mitigate the risks of bidders colluding. To start, the `reservePrice` will simply be the minReservePrice.\n* The ability to rotate the auctioneer\u2019s key for submitting bids and the reserve price setter key for changing reservePrice.\n* The right to impose a minimum balance/deposit requirement on Timeboost bidders in order to mitigate against active or perceived Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs commits to sharing publicly post-mortems and analyses should this scenario arise.\n* The right to disable Timeboost entirely in the event of a security risk or otherwise malicious attempt to harm Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova node operators, existing deployed applications, and/or end users. The Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs commits to sharing publicly post-mortems and analyses should this scenario arise.\n\nModifications to other Timeboost parameters, including to values outside the specified ranges and to those not already listed above, but which are otherwise listed in the design specification, will require a constitutional governance vote, in accordance with the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution).\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf the ArbitrumDAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:\n\n1. Discussion of the proposal on the forum (this post) and governance call(s). \n\n2. A vote on Snapshot to decide between*\n  * Option 1 (collect ETH), \n  * Option 2 (burn ARB), or \n  * Option 3 (decline to adopt Timeboost)\n3. Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet, such as Arbitrum Sepolia\n\n4.

The proposal outlines various options, ranging from maintaining the status quo to enforcing strict self-voting policies. A Snapshot vote to gauge the DAO's sentiment will be posted on Thursday, August 15th. Please note, this is an **actual temperature check**, just to gauge the DAO\u2019s opinion on the subject. Based on the results, certain policies may be included in a future delegate of code of conduct as part of an effort to professionalize the DAO\u2019s operations.\n\n## Background\n\nStrict policies regarding conflicts of interest (COI) and self-dealing are standard practices in traditional corporate industries. However, with crypto just now emerging from an early stage, entirely avoiding conflict of interests is challenging. Many individuals are either investors, employees, or contributors across multiple companies/protocols on not only Arbitrum, but other L1/L2 chains.\n\nSeveral other DAOs have established a code of conduct in an attempt to address these issues. Examples range from being opt-in recommendations ([Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-delegate-code-of-conduct/20913)), simple pledges ([Maker](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384), [Gitcoin](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/code-of-conduct), [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-delegate-code-of-conduct/12981)), and strict no self-dealing policies & expectations enforced by a council and violations resulting in suspension from the DAO\u2019s platforms (Optimism: [Code of Conduct Committee](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101), [Optimist Expectations](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241)).\n\nWhile Arbitrum has standard [rules of engagement](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807?u=pruitt) for the forums, it currently lacks a delegate code of conduct in addition to an official policy on conflicts of interest. The only mention of the term in the Arbitrum [Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) is in relation to candidate eligibility for the Security Council.\n\nCreating a self-voting policy was first [raised](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886/8) by @Immutablelawyer at the beginning of 2024 following the LTIPP council elections. While the post resulted in a good discussion, many delegates at the time indicated a strong preference to not move forward with any policy that restricted a delegate\u2019s ability to vote. Thus a temperature check to gather the larger DAO\u2019s sentiment on this issue never occurred.\n\nIn recent weeks, the topic has reemerged in conversations, and as part of a series of proposals focusing on professionalizing the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s operations, Entropy Advisors is looking to restart the conversation on a proposed self-voting and COI policy in order to reach a definite consensus. Policies that are voted are favored by the DAO will be included in a future delegate code of conduct proposal.\n\n## Rationale\n\nWe would argue that within a DAO\u2019s operations, the majority of instances involving COI are the result of an individual/company using their delegated voting power to engage in self-voting or \u201cself-enrichment\u201d. This can exist when a delegate votes for themselves to get elected to a committee, thereby receiving financial gain, or a delegate votes in favor of a proposal that directly benefits themselves or their company. There are certainly other situations where COI can arise such as oversight, but for the purposes of this proposal, the focus is centered on the practice of self-voting.\n\nFor clarity and the purposes of this conversation we will lean on the definitions that @Immutablelawyer established back when the topic of self-voting was previously [discussed](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886).\n\n* **Conflicts of Interest:** A situation where a token-holder or their close-associates stand to directly benefit from the outcome of a proposal.\n* **Self-Voting:** The practice of where token holders use their voting power to vote on proposals that involve or benefit themselves.\n* **Self-Enrichment (Self-Dealing):** The act of increasing or enhancing one\u2019s own personal financial wealth as a result of one's own vote.\n\nAs mentioned above, the majority of comments indicated that it was unwise to restrict a delegate\u2019s ability to vote in any manner. To paraphrase the discussion, hesitation to implement a self-voting policy boiled down to primarily two reasons:\n\n* **Philosophical Objections:** Delegates are entrusted by token holders to best represent their own values and interests. Forcing a delegate to abstain from a vote due to COI concerns prevents the delegate from truly representing their base\u2019s interests and thus disenfranchises the token holders delegating.\n* **Lack of Enforceability:** Even if self-voting was monitored manually by contributors or a committee, it is quite easy to circumvent self-voting policies onchain by simply transferring voting power to anonymous wallets. To quote @DisruptionJoe, in general, \u201cunenforceable rules create situations where bad actors have an advantage over good actors''.\n\nWhile both are strong objections, there are positives to implementing COI and self-voting policies. First, they help establish the \u201crules of the game\u201d, so that every participant in Arbitrum governance is operating under the same set of expectations. Furthermore, disclosure requirements can help lead to greater transparency while also incentivizing participants to act in an ethical manner. Most importantly, with such policies standard practice in other industries, Arbitrum DAO can improve its image as a professional organization by holding its actors to similar standards.\n\n## Specifications\n\nBelow are a few policy options the DAO can adopt to help address and mitigate COI and self-voting. The options are presented from least restrictive (do nothing) to what we view as the most restrictive.\n\n**Keep the Status Quo:** Arbitrum DAO can continue to operate as it has been. A delegate code of conduct does not need to include specific policies on disclosure or self-voting.\n\n**Disclosure and Transparency Policy:** If a potential COI exists, it is expected that proposal authors or delegates disclose the nature and extent of the interest. While it may not always be clear if an individual stands to gain \u201cdirectly\u201d or \u201cindirectly\u201d, it is recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency. Delegates are not expected to abstain or alter their voting preferences in any way, but are free to choose to abstain.\n\n**\u201cResponsible Voting\u201d Policy in Elections:** In an election with multiple seats, candidates may vote for themselves as long as they also cast votes to fill the remaining positions. Put more simply, a candidate should not cast a vote solely for themselves in an election. In the case of a weighted voting election, the candidate's weight for themself should not be larger than the weights for other candidate. To the best of their ability they should strive to make the weights as equal as possible among the number of candidates necessary to fill each position. \n\n* Example: I am running in the GCP council election, which has 3 open seats. I can vote for my own candidacy, but must also cast 2 additional votes for other candidates.\n\nThis is a policy that has worked well in other DAOs and helps address the natural incentive to withhold votes for competing candidates in an election while also making sure token-holders are not disenfranchised.\n\nCredit to @JoJo for the term \u201cResponsible Voting\u201d.\n\n**Strict Self-Voting Policy:** In the event of a conflict of interest, under the simple definitions stated in the Rationale above, it is expected that a delegate or proposal author abstains during the voting process. In the event that \"Abstain\" is not presented as a voting option, it is expected that the delegate votes in a neutral manner as to not impact the results of the vote. For example, in an election a delegate may even divide their voting power in equal weight to effectively abstain. This policy would include candidates being prevented from self-voting in elections and delegates from voting on proposals that directly benefit oneself, company, or interests.\n\n### Voting Choices\n\nThe temperature check on Snapshot will use [approval voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types). Each delegate can select any number of choices, each selected choice will receive equal voting power. So for example, if a delegate wishes to see the DAO adopt both a disclosure policy and responsible voting, then they should select both options on the Snapshot vote.\n\nSince this is a proposal that changes the DAO\u2019s current status quo, the following choices have been worded in a manner that each \u201cFOR\u201d vote indicates desire to adopt a certain policy.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "b7274dfb-805d-4c11-9997-d58512d12641", "proposal_id": "e76ff9a8-79c4-416f-bfe1-28036640f84d", "snapshot_id": "0x7cc26491a070c74c1a4ec5a9892571d31eb690015936a35b52c0d3a97bd5497f", "title": "[CONSTITUTIONAL] AIP: ArbOS Version 40 Callisto", "author_name": "0xb4c064f466931B8d0F637654c916E3F203c46f13", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7cc26491a070c74c1a4ec5a9892571d31eb690015936a35b52c0d3a97bd5497f", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-02-20 23:00:00", "voting_end": "2025-02-27 23:00:00", "options": {"scores": [123959243.23349434, 7831.854923975474, 20030177.15908057], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-02-27 23:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.348", "body": "Type: Constitutional AIP\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes to upgrade Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to ArbOS 40 \u201cCallisto\u201d.

This is because of two reasons. First, Arbitrum chains do not require nodes to send blocks over the network through its peer-to-peer layer and instead rely on the parent chain\u2019s RPC to retrieve block data. Secondly, because Arbitrum block sizes are already limited to ~100KB and so increasing calldata cost is not expected to reduce Arbitrum block sizes.\n* [EIP-7685: General purpose execution layer requests](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685): because Arbitrum chains do not have a beacon chain and, therefore, there is nothing to request from the EL on Arbitrum chains.\n* [EIP-7840: Add blob schedule to EL configuration files](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840): because Arbitrum chains do not support posting blobs on the rollup (but otherwise still does support posting blobs to Ethereum L1).\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nMore detailed information about the specific implementation and versions will be provided closer to the date of the formal on-chain Tally vote. However, this proposal will roughly follow the below steps:\n\n1. An AIP outlining the proposed upgrade and specification is proposed to the ArbitrumDAO Forum for discussion (this post)\n2. A temperature check vote is held on Snapshot\n3. Engineering work to scope out and implement the relevant changes for ArbOS 40 Callisto into the Nitro node software, relevant rollup contracts, and associated upgrade actions (this work has already begun).\n4. A security audit of all ArbOS 40 relevant changes is conducted by a third-party (Trail of Bits) and the audit report is published for public consumption.\n5. A new version of Nitro and nitro-contracts is released that support ArbOS 40 Callisto.\n6. Should the Snapshot vote pass, then ArbOS 40 Callisto will be deployed to both private devnets & Arbitrum Sepolia for testing.\n7. A formal AIP and call-to-vote is proposed to Tally for the on-chain vote.\n8. If the Tally vote passes, ArbOS 40 Callisto will be activated on Arbitrum One and on Arbitrum Nova following the required waiting periods and phases, as outlined in the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution for a Constitutional AIP](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal).\n\n### **Note on Pectra hard fork timelines:**\n\nSimilar to the [ArbOS 20 Atlas upgrade](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos20) and the [Ethereum Dencun hard fork](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/02/27/dencun-mainnet-announcement) in March 2024, the activation timestamp for ArbOS 40 Callisto will be targeted for roughly the same timestamp as when Ethereum Mainnet hard forks. At the time of writing and as of the latest [All Core Devs Consensus (ACDC) Call #150 held on Feb 6th, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-150-february-6-2025/22703), the timestamp of the Ethereum Mainnet fork for Pectra is targeted for April 8, 2025. The tentative dates for Ethereum Holesky and Ethereum Sepolia to upgrade to Pectra are Feb 24, 2025 and March 5, 2025, respectively. The exact slot for mainnet Ethereum is expected to be chosen on March 6, 2025.\n\nGiven that the L1 client teams are planning to release their Pectra-supported versions by Feb 13, 2025 and that the required steps for a [Constitutional AIP can take up to ~41.4 days](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal) (not including engineering and audit), there is a strong likelihood that ArbOS 40 Callisto will be activated on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova after Ethereum Mainnet upgrades to Pectra (if the ArbitrumDAO votes to adopt this proposal).

This extension will run from September 16th to November 16th, 2024 (edit: with Snapshot ending dates) aligning the deployment of the remaining grant funds with a major product launch.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum community should implement this extension to maximize the impact of the originally approved grant, which targeted LP & stablecoin incentives. By aligning the distribution with the launch of our Arbitrum-exclusive Multi-Collateral Perps feature, we can ensure greater engagement, trading volume, and overall ecosystem growth.\n\n# Rationale\n\nSynthetix has experienced unforeseen delays in its deployment of Synthetix Perps on Arbitrum. We originally expected to launch by late July, to align with one month of Perps fee rebates. However, due to audits and other factors, and to ensure the top performance of our Arbitrum-exclusive multi-collateral perps feature, we\u2019ve been unable to hit these targets. As a result, we\u2019ve not utilized 900k ARB from our proposal and would like to seek an extension.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Multi-Collateral Perps : A feature allowing users to margin with ETH, BTC, and USDx for perpetual futures trading on Arbitrum with Synthetix Perps.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe extension will utilize the remaining 900k ARB tokens from our original proposal for trading fee rebates. These rebates will be distributed over 8 weeks, coinciding with the launch of Multi-Collateral Perps. This approach ensures:\n\n1. Full implementation of the Multi-Collateral Perps feature\n2. Complete integration with frontend partners, particularly Kwenta as our launch partner\n3. Enhanced capital efficiency with multiple margin options, new trading \nstrategies, trading types, etc.\n4. Improved user experience and market competitiveness as an Arbitrum exclusive launch\n\n# Steps to Implement\n1. Launch Multi-Collateral Perps feature on Arbitrum (this week)\n2. Begin distribution of trading fee rebates\n3. Monitor and report on the impact of the rebates and new feature\n\n# Timeline\n* Start Date: September 16th\n* End Date: November 16th\n* Total 8 week program from starting date. (Original TBD dates have been edited based on Snapshot timing)\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThe extension utilizes the remaining 900,000 ARB tokens from the originally approved 2 million ARB grant. Over the 8-week period, this amount will be fully distributed as trading fee rebates as per our original LTIP grant.\n\n* Total Cost: 900,000 ARB tokens\n* Weekly Distribution: 112,500 ARB tokens (900,000 / 8 weeks)\n\nNo additional funds are being requested beyond the original grant allocation.\n\n# Additional Context\n\nWe have been working with the LTIP Council, @Matt_StableLab, and others to work out the best path to request this extension, and we started requesting information & guidance on July 21st.\n\nWe\u2019ve also posted about our proposed plans in our original LTIP [thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023) which included options on how to best proceed.\n\nWe plan to post this on Snapshot, not Tally, next week with the help of @krst, as it does not utilize any additional funds.

All expenditures will follow The Foundation\u2019s well-established practices and evaluation criteria when pursuing partnership deals. Should the proposal be approved by the ArbitrumDAO, the Foundation will update its next annual transparency report due in Q1 2025 to include and detail this additional budget.\n\n# Motivation\nIn line with its mission as seen in its [bylaws](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf), The Foundation is committed to fostering ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. All agreements are designed to support projects that can grow the Arbitrum ecosystem and provide value to the ArbitrumDAO. By seeking projects that advance or contribute to the adoption of Arbitrum technology, the Foundation aims to grow activity on the Arbitrum networks.\n\nAgreements typically last for a few years in order to align a project\u2019s interests with the long-term objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This results in significant capital locked in commitments and reserved for projects based on the agreed performance milestones. This restricts the Foundation\u2019s ability to pursue new partnerships and stay ahead of the competition. Given the aggregate size of Foundation\u2019s current budget, it is difficult for us to pursue multiple large deals simultaneously.\n\n# Challenges\nThe Foundation runs two funding programs:\n\n* Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program\n* Strategic Partnership\u2019s Program\n\nBoth programs invite applicants from the ecosystem while actively pursuing new opportunities by participating in competitive bids to prospective partners. In both cases, The Foundation signs milestone-based agreements with the recipient that are often multi-year contractual commitments. To date, agreements for our strategic partnerships program typically exceed 2M ARB with an average duration of 2.1 years.\n\n*Table: Capital Commitments to Grants, Strategic Partnerships and Infrastructure Service Providers*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibub2zxpre2wwuuetnzxqnwuea4yrjtfknh5mb6p3jebvvk7sd76q)\n\n*1) Includes payments made in ARB converted to USD using the ARB spot price at the time of payment*\n*2) Includes both [confidential and non-confidential grants](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/d8de51f4a1b84b18ab33b2c9d14c69ae?v=4b8df83cbb7e4da9ad1e9b0e9354389a)*\n*3) Includes items that fall outside the scope of the rows above*\n\nThis table provides an overview of The Foundation\u2019s outstanding capital commitments since its inception, as of June 30th 2024. Based on the stage of commitment, we can classify all existing deals into two categories:\n\n* **Signed agreements.** The Foundation and the grant recipient or service provider have entered into an agreement. Most grant recipients will be entitled to grant payouts as milestones and/or other criteria are reached. The amounts in the table reflect the value of future financial obligations related to signed agreements.\n\n* **Pre-agreement offer.** An agreement has not yet been reached but is in negotiation. The Foundation has reserved funds to ensure we can act upon the commitment when an agreement is reached. The amounts in the table reflect the full value of the agreement.\n\nIn both cases, The Foundation must have adequate reserves available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners simultaneously, and be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.\n\nWith the above in mind, The Foundation is at a distinct disadvantage from extending competitive offers to strategic partners due to the size of our overall allocation from the DAO. The three major financial challenges currently facing The Foundation from extending continued support to ecosystem expansion are:\n\n* **Tight budget.** Relative to competitors, the budget that the Foundation can allocate for strategic partnerships is small and puts the Arbitrum ecosystem at a significant disadvantage. For example, if we consider allocations relative to token supply, Starknet has allocated ~20% to its Foundation and grants, Optimism has 25% for ecosystem funding, ZkSync has 19.9% for ecosystem initiatives, while The Arbitrum Foundation has 7.5% allocated, but to date, The Arbitrum Foundation has only had access to approximately 1.8% because of the vesting contract. \n\n* **Vesting.** The Foundation can only make offers based on the ARB that has vested to date. This is because the ArbitrumDAO can clawback the funds at any time and we must have the ARB available to pay milestones. The Foundation is committed to being solvent at all times, so our assets should always exceed our contractual liabilities.\n\n* **Capital lockup.** All committed ARB in a milestone-based agreement must be allocated until the agreement terminates. Additionally, some agreements require capital lockup (like RWAs), in projects where the funds belong to the Foundation, but they are utilized by the strategic partner\u2019s protocol.\n\nTogether, The Foundation does not yet have access to its full budget which has caused issues over the past year, but even if the vesting was complete, our budget still remains the smallest amongst all rollups. This impacts all programs run by The Foundation including strategic partnerships, technical advancement, educational and community activities.\n\nWe believe the most straightforward approach to ensuring The Arbitrum Foundation can pursue competitive deals is by increasing our budget for strategic partnerships.\n\n# Proposed Solution\n\n**Funding Request: 250 million ARB**\n\nIn light of the aforementioned challenges, here are the reasons why we believe that increasing our budget to specifically better support strategic partnerships is essential:\n\n* **High costs of pursuing partnerships.** Strategic partnerships are essential for the Arbitrum ecosystem\u2019s growth, and these partnerships often come with significant capital investments from The Foundation. For example, onboarding RWAs is both challenging and capital-intensive, as experienced by the DAO as well.\n\n* **Expanding Orbit Chains.** Despite more than 50 chains publicly announcing their intent to build using Orbit since the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program in January 2024, the rollup as a tech stack ecosystem is still in its early stages. Additional funding is required to enable The Foundation to pursue major Orbit partnerships and allow the Arbitrum ecosystem to access new markets, use cases and communities.\n\n* **Gateway to DAO.** The DAO has previously contributed to onboarding partners via programs like STEP, however, the experience has been that most institutions are not inclined toward engaging and participating in public forums, and even when they do it is after extensive conversations with The Foundation and its service providers, who are making them aware of the opportunities and encouraging them to get involved. As front-line enablers, The Foundation actively builds relationships with partners and encourages all partners to engage with the DAO. Most recent examples include Securitize (via BlackRock BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton.\n\n* **Proven track record.** The Foundation has a proven track record of managing and allocating funds effectively for various initiatives, as evidenced by the [2024 Biannual Progress Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/ArbitrumFoundationBiannualReport2024H1-c8e9ab997fe68ad09c0105181f9826d8.pdf) and successful collaborations with industry-leading projects. Additionally, The Foundation has capitalized on emerging opportunities such as LRTs, RWAs and onchain gaming, ensuring the Arbitrum ecosystem remains competitive and innovative.\n\nWe also believe the current vesting schedule for our entire budget is still critical to remain as is for setting expectations for The Foundation and holding us accountable for how we execute our mission statements. This sets a good example that all programs approved by the DAO must remain accountable and should not assume they can receive all their funding immediately.\n\nWith the above in mind, we are requesting 250 million ARB from the ArbitrumDAO, to focus on agreements fulfilling the following 3 criteria:\n\n* Key opportunities exceeding 2 million ARB\n* New agreements signed after approval of this proposal\n* Contractual commitments lasting 1 year or longer\n\nSome foreseeable capital-intensive areas include but are not limited to, expanding the Orbit Chain ecosystem, securing new RWA opportunities, and onboarding well-known TradeFi institutions on Arbitrum. Tokens will only be allocated on an as-needed basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.\n\nThe Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. At the same time, we remain committed to respecting any confidentiality provisions stipulated in such agreements. By balancing transparency with confidentiality, The Foundation aims to balance both the sensitivity of onboarding traditional institutions to Arbitrum and also providing updates to the DAO on how the funds are being spent.\n\nOur goal with this proposal is not to maintain the status quo, it is to ensure that we can continue to foster ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. The funds will not be used for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "b95a1f31-1707-4a60-863f-d4fe5474f4df", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xe52ab17d41249186c4dc54afdb481e120572102ad222d4e2af13a92791d72344", "title": "Arbitrum D.A.O.

While these allocations have driven significant growth and innovation, there has been minimal oversight or review of how these funds are ultimately used, and no system currently exists to incentivize the identification and reporting of fund misappropriation. Although three instances of misuse have been uncovered, it is likely that additional cases remain undetected.\n\nIn response, Entropy Advisors proposes the **establishment of a grant misuse bounty program dubbed \u201cThe Watchdog\u201d** to incentivize the identification and reporting of misused DAO-allocated funds. The program would utilize an incentive mechanism to reward community contributors and investigators who submit verifiable reports of misappropriation. If the proposal passes a temperature check, Entropy will manage a selection process to determine a suitable platform to host the Watchdog program.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nBy offering financial rewards for valid reports of misappropriation, there will be a stronger motivation for community members to contribute skills or information that aid in identifying misconduct in the DAO. Today, the identification of wrongdoing can result in retaliation, unnecessary friction within the DAO, and other negative externalities for the investigators. Moreover, with no incentive to bring forth allegations, it is unlikely that most community members would do so. The Watchdog program creates a decentralized force of accountability, augmenting the DAO\u2019s capacity to detect abuse that would likely otherwise go unnoticed while protecting the submitter from repercussions.\n\nArbitrum DAO\u2019s successful identification of misappropriated funds, whether by a service provider, protocol, grant recipient, or anyone else that receives funds from Arbitrum DAO has two large benefits:\n\n1. The DAO (mainly through the Foundation, as it has done so in the [past](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-announcement-multisig-returns-leftover-funds/26383)) may be able to recapture some of the funds. This could involve legal avenues, smart contract enforcement (clawbacks / stream stopping), or community pressure.\n2. The evidence can be used to identify possible improvement opportunities in the underlying programs and make more informed decisions surrounding the recognized bad actors in the future.\n\nOther benefits include a mechanism for malicious action deterrence and bringing sophisticated onchain sleuths into the DAO.\n\nJust the existence of a transparent and well-publicized bounty program will likely deter some malicious actors from misusing DAO funds in the first place. Knowing that the community has the tools and incentives to identify misallocation increases the risk of exposure for those who might consider abusing the DAO\u2019s trust. Recipients of DAO funds will need to think twice before acting maliciously or in a way that doesn\u2019t align with the DAO\u2019s strategic objectives, rules, and the broader interests of Arbitrum.\n\nBy allowing anyone to submit evidence-based reports of misuse anonymously, the program empowers the entire Arbitrum and crypto ecosystem to take an active role in maintaining the financial health and integrity of the Arbitrum DAO. We hope this fosters a culture of vigilance, good intentions, and accountability while bringing white-hat actors into the ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Watchdog program will extend to ALL DAO-funded initiatives including end recipients of other programs such as the Questbook Domain program, Stylus Sprint, Arbitrum Foundation grants, and the incentives programs. The process for rewarding those who successfully identify fund misuse will start with a temporary solution utilizing a small committee of reviewers with a long-term plan for the program to eventually fall under OpCo, if and when it is stood up.\n\nEntropy proposes the following definition of misuse of funds:\n\n*Any action or inaction by a recipient of DAO-allocated funds that directly violates the stated terms, objectives, agreement, or overall spirit of the allocation under which those funds were provided.*\n\nMisuse definitions and examples below are included solely as a point of reference for the DAO and all decisions surrounding severity will be at the full discretion of the committee:\n\n* **Low:** Cases where there is minor misuse of DAO-allocated funds with limited impact on the DAO\u2019s overall financial health, reputation, or strategic goals.\n  * Example: A Questbook domain allocator accidentally sent a double payment for a milestone and the recipient did not report it.\n  * Example: A grant recipient uses a portion of the funds for unauthorized purposes, such as non-DAO-aligned marketing, travel, or administrative overhead not included in the grant proposal.\n* **Medium:** Cases involving significant misuse of DAO-allocated funds that impact the DAO\u2019s resources or strategic goals, but where the misuse is still recoverable, or partial results have been delivered.\n  * Example: An incentive program recipient uses funds in a way that does not benefit end users, but is a step away from outright theft and fraud.\n  * Example: A grant recipient diverts a significant portion of the funds (e.g., 50k+ ARB) to unrelated projects or personal use.\n* **High:** Cases involving large-scale, deliberate misuse of DAO-allocated funds.\n  * Example: A fund-recipient fabricates deliverables to obtain funds without working on the approved project, then disappears with the entire grant.\n  * Example 2: Theft or unauthorized transfers, such as if MSS members purposefully diverted funds to a recipient not eligible.\n\nThe workflow for Watchdog reports will be as follows:\n\n**1. Report Submission**\n\n* Anyone (watchers) can identify potential misuse of funds that originated from the DAO and submit an evidence-based report to a designated section on a to-be-determined bounty platform. Throughout the entire process, the identity of the submitter will remain private. As detailed further in step 3, the report will only be made public to the DAO in the instance that attempts at backchannel communications with the alleged party fail and a DAO ban is constituted or on a case-by-case basis where the committee deems it prudent to make the DAO aware of the misuse.\n* Reports will follow a standard template to help streamline the review process and collect the initial necessary information.\n\n**2. Review Process**\n\n* A whitelisted group of three DAO-associated reviewers will have the ability to review the submitted reports. We propose the group of initial reviewers to comprise the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and the elected Research Member of the ARDC. This structure minimizes the operating costs of the program until OpCo is stood up., Entropy and the Arbitrum Foundation will be waiving payment as reviewers. The ARDC Research Member will be paid at their stated hourly rate, with funds coming from the ARDC V2 budget. We anticipate the review process for a Watchdog report to take a minimal amount of hours.\n* The three reviewers will discuss reports and, if required, contact the concerned party for clarifications. If two or more reviewers agree (at their discretion) that the submission is based on substance and misuse has occurred, the watcher(s) will receive the bounty. The reviewers will also determine the level of severity of the misuse (Low, Medium, High), which will impact the bounty reward as outlined in step 4.\n* In the case that 2 or more reviewers deem there has been fund misuse, the Arbitrum Foundation will open up private channels of communication with the concerned party and attempt to get the funds back for the DAO.\n* Reviewers are required to abstain from specific review processes if a conflict of interest (COI) is identified. If two or more reviewers have an identified COI, the reviewers will identify two external parties who don\u2019t have COIs and have the capabilities to review the report. If the report is made public, the reviewers\u2019 identified COIs will be published at the same time. To reduce the need for an additional election process and budgeted compensation, Entropy suggests utilizing the soon-to-be-elected Domain Allocators from the D.A.O. program, MSS members, and the other ARDC V2 members for the short list of trusted community members to step in if multiple COIs exist.\n\n**3. DAO Forum & Snapshot Voting**\n\n* If all attempts at backchanneling are failed, the report will be posted to the forum with all the watcher\u2019s personal and identifiable information redacted in the version posted publicly. On a case by case basis, the committee may decide to post a summary of the report to inform the DAO of the misuse. Otherwise individual reports will not be posted to the forum directly. It is Entropy\u2019s belief that in instances of low misuse, it is unwise to subject teams to public scrutiny for what could be a common or minor error.\n* The DAO will vote via Snapshot on whether or not the violation constitutes a DAO ban. Delegates can reference the Furucombo [instance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/potential-misuse-of-funds-furucombo/25496) as an example.\n* The Foundation will determine in which instance of legal recourse is viable. This will be dependent on the size of funds involved in the misuse and legal jurisdiction of the accused party.\n\n**4. Reward Mechanism**\n\n* If the review committee deems a report valid at their discretion, they will deem what level of misuse. A certain level of subjectivity has been introduced due to the wide range of programs that the Watchdog program will cover. A mix of factors will be taken into account the level of severity. These include, but are not limited to the total amount of funds involved, how the funds were used (ex. simple error or intentional fraud), if the misuse is rectifiable, and/or the level of damage to the Abitrum ecosystem/brand.\n  * **Low:** 1k ARB base payout + 5% of recovered funds capped at an additional $10k\n  * **Medium:** 10k ARB base payout + 5% of recovered funds capped at an additional $20k\n  * **High:** 30k ARB + 5% of recovered funds capped at an additional $100k\n* A fixed reward has been included to ensure that an incentive always exists for community members and individuals to submit reports. The base payouts denominated in ARB will come from the approved Watchdog budget.\n* If recaptured funds are denominated in a volatile asset, the maximum reward awarded to the watcher will be calculated as the 30D TWAP of the underlying asset on the day the transfer is made. For clarity, the reward is still paid out in the recovered asset.\n* While anyone is encouraged to submit reports, only watchers that complete a KYC with the Foundation will be eligible for rewards.\n* The program will run until the 400K ARB is exhausted from valid misuse reports. Once 100k ARB remains, a proposal will be put forward to the DAO to extend the budget or shut down the program.\n\nWe believe that this mechanism is optimal for the time being, but if/once OpCo is stood up, the program could be moved into its domain. If done so, the reviewer and voting mechanism would likely need to be restructured.\n\nThe expectation will be that 6 months post program launch, Entropy Advisors will raise a subsequent vote to the DAO in order to gauge the program's success. At this point the DAO can determine if the program should continue in its current state, be moved under OpCo if or when it is stood up, or if the program should be discontinued. Entropy will provide a retrospective report near the end of the 6-month trial to help the DAO evaluate the successfulness of the program. The report will summarize the received misuse cases along with data such as total amount of misuse, severity breakdowns, and amount of ARB recovered.\n\n### Steps to Implement: RFP Process\n\nIt will be necessary to create a secure platform where community members or contributors can privately submit their reports. This will ensure confidentiality and data security for all parties involved. With the requirements resembling a bug bounty program, we imagine that an existing platform can quickly build the necessary portal. If the proposal passes a temperature check, Entropy will directly contact potential providers and solicit bids that will be publicly posted in a dedicated subcategory in the forum. Delegates will have visibility into the bids, but Entropy will conduct negotiations, select the provider, and present a summary of the rationale to the DAO prior to the proposal moving to Tally. Unless the DAO feels strongly about being involved in the selection process, our team views this as the simplest and quickest route to choosing a provider. The Arbitrum Foundation will serve as the counterparty for the agreement.\n\nEntropy refrained from setting a maximum budget at this stage as to not publicly signal to interested providers what amount the DAO would be willing to pay. Additionally, depending on whether the portal needs to be built from scratch or simply added to an existing platform, the costs may vary greatly.\n\n## Budget\n\nIn total 400,000 ARB + the necessary amount of ARB for the selected bounty platform (determined by RFP process) will be sent to a new MSS multisig in order to facilitate the program.\n\n* 400,000 ARB available to reward valid Watchdog reports.\n* Amount of ARB necessary to build and host the Watchdog program. To be determined through a RFP process.\n\n## Timeline\n\nDecember 20th: Forum post\nJanuary 16th-23rd: Snapshot vote\nJanuary 24th : Procurement process begins\nTBD: Onchain Vote\nTBD: Program is launched\n\n## Voting Options\n\nWith the RFP process happening pre-Tally ratification, the Snapshot vote will be subjected to the non-constitutional quorum requirements of 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain.\n\nIt will be a basic vote with FOR, AGAINST, and ABSTAIN as the three options.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nOutside of being placed as one of the three reviewers, Entropy does not have any other conflicts of interest to disclose as part of this proposal.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "bd46f873-4c62-41ea-a32a-e7057b0068e4", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x97f1ffcf2fb02b4adb55807641dc1f8aecceeeed7c446dfebbd63dbf2a636fa4", "title": "Perennial Finance STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0xF4B0556B9B6F53E00A1FDD2b0478Ce841991D8fA", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x97f1ffcf2fb02b4adb55807641dc1f8aecceeeed7c446dfebbd63dbf2a636fa4", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [155870428.610555, 5961018.916738673, 27665887.07905343], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.34", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

While the protocol does not necessarily bring anything new to Arbitrum, it is one of the more reasonable grant requests for bridging protocols. Furthermore, we appreciate the marketing efforts with Galxe to increase awareness and funnel users to Arbitrum.\nNot sure if it was implied under cross-chain swaps, but it would\u2019ve been good to see Symbiosis incentivize cross-chain swaps into DeFi protocols on Arbitrum.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis grant plan focuses directly on lowering the cost to bridge onto Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova by subsidizing the gas costs to bridge in. While a 100% rebate may offer some niche griefing attack by someone seeking to drain the grant funds, they probably would not have a profit motive to do so. The request is reasonable in size, the plan easy to measure, and directly targets increasing the number of assets and users on Arbitrum. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nI\u2019m generally supportive of the Symbiosis application on the basis of the sector they\u2019re involved with. Bridge and crosschain development can only benefit a network. The grant was straightforward and it seems Symbiosis is cognizant of the space they\u2019re operating within and their place in it. The proposal from Symbiosis presents a comprehensive strategy to drive liquidity and user engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem. By offering gas fee refunds for cross-chain swaps, Symbiosis aims to incentivize users and attract significant trading volume to both Arbitrum One and Nova. The clear objectives, well-defined milestones, and commitment to transparent reporting demonstrate a thoughtful approach to achieving measurable outcomes. Furthermore, the integration of incentives with Galxe for wider outreach enhances the potential impact of the initiative.

This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings (https://spark.fi). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings (https://app.spark.fi/), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem\u2019s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won\u2019t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS \u2013 Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS \u2013 Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at https://app.spark.fi/) \n- USDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\n\n- sUSDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793\n\n- Official USDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b\n\n- Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router.

Please find the full proposal on the forums: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734\n\n## Abstract\n\nTo ensure Arbitrum\u2019s continued presence at the industry\u2019s most prominent events, and to enable the DAO to host in-person initiatives to accelerate collaboration and increase efficiency of operations, we (Entropy Advisors, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe) would like to earmark a budget for events for 2025 and take lead on running ongoing RFPs to satisfy the DAOs event demands. The 3 members of this group will lean on OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that any events organized by the DAO are aligned with the broader ecosystem of contributors, work towards a unified message/brand, and are synergistic with events led by the Foundation and OCL.\n\nOur proposed Events strategy should focus on 2 key categories:\n\n1. Delegate Gatherings aimed at streamlining operations through in-person meetups such as a delegate retreat.\n2. Ecosystem Growth Events to foster innovation and community engagement, ideally coinciding with other major crypto conferences (specifically ETHDenver, Bitcoin 2025: Las Vegas, EthCC, among other potential events) at the same location. These events can include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * Virtual hackathons\n  * Non-crypto conference presence (RustConf, CES, etc.)\n  * In-person hackathons\n  * Side events\n  * Sponsorships of major events\n  * Arbitrum Days around the world (not just EthCC)\n  * Educational workshops (Stylus & Orbit)\n\nThe selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC and Disruption Joe, we will gauge community sentiment/attendance levels regarding certain events. If there is consensus to put on a certain event but there is no PM/event coordinator to lead the effort, the group will procure, select, and support service providers to make the vision a reality. It is highly likely the OCL or the Arbitrum Foundation will lead many of these events, which is made apparent by the preliminary schedule proposed below. Alternatively, if an events provider comes to the DAO with a proposal for an event that passes a Snapshot vote that garners at least 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority For/Abstain, the funds for that proposal will come from the 2025 events budget brought forth in this proposal.\n\nWe propose the earmarking of $1.5M USD to fund this initiative, with any unused funds at the end of 2025 to be returned to the DAO treasury. 4M ARB will be sent to a Foundation-controlled address to be liquidated into stablecoins, with any excess ARB immediately returned to the DAO treasury and the stablecoins to an MSS-controlled address. The ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe will be waiving payment to get this stood up, but we expect this initiative to fall under the OpCo once it becomes fully operational. We also envision a dedicated employee to lead the DAO\u2019s event strategy within the OpCo, so this is more of an effort to get the ball rolling so we are properly prepared for 2025. We plan to have the OpCo established in mid 2025, and once an events coordinator is employed by this entity, the funds will be transferred to the OpCo while Entropy, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe will be relieved of their duties thereafter.\n\n## Specifications\n\nIn order to eliminate the potential for event overload, we are capping the number of delegate gatherings to two for the year - but are leaving the number of ecosystem growth events open-ended. These events should be planned in such a way that no two events align too closely with one another on dates, with the exception of delegate offsites which could coincide with an ecosystem growth event at a major crypto conference given the convenience of planning travel arrangements. While the primary goal of delegate offsites should be aligning ecosystem leaders and providing a dedicated place/time for more efficient in-person working hours, the ecosystem growth category is more vague in nature. However, all applicants should have clearly articulated goals for the events in line with the defined events strategy, i.e., driving the adoption of Stylus through a hackathon, generating thought-provoking governance proposals, or onboarding new people into the DAO similar to GovHack. Events brought forward by either an individual or service provider, must create a post-event impact report ([example](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethcc-brussels-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/26530?u=entropy) from Govhack Brussels) that includes a breakdown of actual costs. Service providers that are procured to execute on an event idea will also be required to provide a post-event impact report.\n\nFor concrete examples of how this could work, we can take a look at the 2 proposals for events currently on the forum. The GovHack Core proposal (which has since been rescinded) was brought forth by Hack Humanity, which serves as a great example of a scenario where the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy would not have been needed in the process at all. Hack Humanity could have taken their proposal to Snapshot, and because they were the service provider themselves, there was no need for any type of procurement process. If the GovHack Core proposal passed snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain, the funds would be sent from the 2025 events budget (this proposal) and Hack Humanity could have begun their planning. This would eliminate the ~4-week onchain voting process and potentially make it possible to put something together for DevCon in Bangkok in just ~2 months.\n\nThis is a prime example of how earmarking an events budget will enable the DAO to move more nimbly. Please note that this proposal is only for 2025, so the previous example is only provided for illustrative purposes. However, it is quite possible that the DAO would rather fund GovHacks on an as-needed/case-by-case basis rather than a whole year, or even open up the event type to other service providers to get new actors involved or potentially lower the price.\n\nIn an earlier iteration of a proposal from [@danielo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo), there was no defined offsite facilitator. This is an example of a proposal that did not specify the service provider, so the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy could have worked together in procuring the proper coordinator upon the proposal passing on Snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply and a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain. The procurement process should bring down overall costs by making the process competitive amongst service providers, and again reduces the lead time by foregoing the onchain Tally vote. Note that this is just an example for illustrative purposes.\n\nIt is expected that the contributor requesting a specific event is tasked with defining the measurable KPIs. The DAO will be tasked with deeming a specific events proposal worthwhile via Snapshot, and we encourage delegates to hold these authors to a high standard when it comes to measuring a given event\u2019s impact and how it pushes Arbitrum\u2019s mission forward.\n\n## Flow of Funds\n\nTo cover the $1.5M dollar-denominated expenses, 4M ARB would be earmarked and sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled wallet, with funds liquidated into a preferred stablecoin and then sent to a MSS-controlled address .Surplus ARB will be sent back to the DAO Treasury following the liquidation. Entropy Advisors, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC will be the point of contact for the MSS chair to greenlight any queued transactions. No transactions will be signed without confirmations from all 3 entities/individuals. The MSS may send stablecoins back to the Arbitrum Foundation in order to pay service providers with fiat if required. Excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025.\n\nUpdates related to funds spent, upcoming events and relevant details, a place to provide feedback or recommendations, or any other communications will be posted to the [ADPC update thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/procurement-committee/27) on the Arbitrum Forum. Alternatively, Entropy can post these to our [updates thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/entropy-advisors-updates/50) on the Arbitrum Forum.\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n1. September 10th: \u201cEstablishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025\u201d Forum post (4 weeks)\n2. October 10th: Snapshot Vote\n3. October 24th: Tally vote (If Snapshot passes and depending on feedback)\n4. November 11th: The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy Advisors can begin working with OCL/the AF and other individuals/SPs to ensure the events calendar brought forth comes to fruition. Dependent on the outcome of the Tally vote.\n\nWe expect this process to take about 2-3 months in its entirety to get underway, which will provide the DAO ample time to prepare for its 2025 events.\n\n## Overall Ask\n\nThe upfront ask to the DAO is $1.5M and the transfer of 4M ARB with the excess returned to the DAO post liquidation, but with just 3 ecosystem growth events outlined in this proposal, the entire budget will not be utilized. However, as mentioned earlier, earmarking these funds gives the DAO the ability to act more nimbly when there is an opportunity to host an event. This will result in the DAO getting better pricing from potential service providers while ensuring the service provider has ample time to do what they do best - organize great events. The DAO can clawback funds from the MSS at any time via a snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "c2419656-59cb-4c22-b7e6-fd2df3994d07", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xf1191061060d8924405b366468d2ce36fbc28653ddaef6678216924d37570e9e", "title": "ApolloX STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf1191061060d8924405b366468d2ce36fbc28653ddaef6678216924d37570e9e", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [9149268.938542465, 80280037.22965592, 34036249.10573858], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.605", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

After taking in community feedback, observing outcomes, and discussions with the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy is proposing the following changes and a 2nd trial period through the end of January 2026:\n\n* Revisions to the Code of Conduct with an additional extension.\n* Changes to the DAO\u2019s Procedures:\n  * **Removal of the Responsible Voting Policy:** Remove the Responsible Voting Policy due to the presence of vote-buying services, which make it impossible to enforce appropriately.\n  * **Member Replacement Process:** Dedicated language that outlines a process for replacing a DAO-elected committee/council member who voluntarily steps away from their responsibilities, if a process is not already pre-defined in the original proposal.\n  * **Cancellation of Ongoing Initiative Process:** Dedicated language that outlines the process to wind down/cancel an initiative if a process is not already defined in the relevant proposal. A Snapshot vote with quorum defined as the number of votes FOR meeting 3% of the votable supply. If there are more voting options than the basic FOR/AGAINST/ABSTAIN, the option with the largest number of votes will be applied, given that the options to modify/cancel an initiative together reach over the active non-constitutional quorum.\n\nWith the initial trial period now concluded, Entropy is seeking to reignite the Code of Conduct & DAO Procedures conversation and welcomes further input from the community.\n\n# Terms\n\n**Contributor:** An individual or entity who willingly engages in Arbitrum governance and/or is compensated via a DAO-approved program.\n\n**DAO-approved program:** A structured initiative that is funded and/or authorized by the Arbitrum DAO through a formal governance vote (Tally or Snapshot) and designed to achieve defined objectives. Examples include the Arbitrum Audit Program, the Arbitrum D.A.O. Grant Program, and other comparable initiatives that receive DAO treasury funding or delegated authority.\n\n**Community Guidelines:** The rules of engagement for the Arbitrum DAO forum as [outlined](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807) and enforced by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n**Conflict of Interest (COI):** A situation where a contributor, or any entity with which a contributor has a direct professional or financial relationship, stands to directly benefit from the outcome of a proposal or election.\n\n**Responsible Voting:** The practice of an election candidate casting votes for oneself and other candidates in a neutral manner to fill all open positions.\n\n**Shielded Voting:** On Snapshot, votes are kept private during the voting process, but made public after the conclusion of the vote.\n\n# Motivation/Rationale\n\nThe Code of Conduct and Procedural Updates were introduced in late 2024 as a trial to establish clear expectations around delegate and contributor behavior and formalize certain aspects of how the DAO operated. At the time, Entropy envisioned that the Code of Conduct could be added to the Arbitrum Constitution to serve as a cultural anchor. However, after further deliberation with the Arbitrum Foundation, our team is in agreement that codifying the Code of Conduct at this stage is premature.\n\nConstitutional amendments are purposefully a high-stakes process that requires strong consensus from delegates and contributors, and thus, we feel it is unwise to push the Code of Conduct forward until it is in a near-final state.\n\nIf the refined Code of Conduct proves effective through continued use, it can be revisited for constitutional inclusion in the future following the conclusion of the 2nd trial period in January 2026. As a reminder, Entropy also proposed adding the DAO\u2019s [Mission, Vision, and Purpose](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-s-mission-vision-purpose-mvp/27275) to the Constitution. When it comes time to make the amendment, we think it is best to combine all proposed changes into a single constitutional proposal.\n\nLastly, the language from the first proposal implied that both the Code of Conduct and Procedural Updates would be included in the Arbitrum Constitution. After consideration, Entropy now firmly believes procedural policies such as voting schedules or shielded elections should remain outside the Constitution as a social contract given the DAO\u2019s constantly evolving nature, thus reserving the document for high-level principles that guide the DAO. Instead, these procedures can be revisited once a year in January following the Holiday Break and changed with a Snapshot vote if needed, with the quorum set at the active non-constitutional quorum level.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Revisions to the Code of Conduct\n\nIn November 2024, the Arbitrum DAO approved the trial of a Code of Conduct via [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2e701a942a8ed6f9ec8302cea866ab08648eeef0d07170814e3a3c3eb4e48415), establishing shared expectations around civility, integrity, transparency, and responsible participation. That code has since served as a behavioral baseline during the initial governance trial.\n\nThe revised Code of Conduct and DAO Procedures will be in effect following its ratification with a Snapshot vote through January 31st, 2026. At the conclusion of this 2nd trial, the DAO can revisit its procedures and discuss if it is time to formalize the Code of Conduct into the Arbitrum Constitution on an annual basis. To ensure that the DAO has ample time to discuss such matters without the Code of Conduct and DAO Procedures losing its validity, the Arbitrum Foundation reserves the right to extend their effectiveness by up to two months through March 31st, 2026 as long as a new version has not yet been officially ratified.\n\nWhen it comes time to add the Code of Conduct to the Arbitrum Constitution, we envision it as a new Section 7, following the existing Section 6: Community Values. In order to keep the included language sufficiently high level, the following quoted block contains the 5 sub-sections to be included:\n\n---\n\n> ### 7.1 Values Alignment\n> \n> Arbitrum contributors should always strive to uphold the seven community values stated above in Section 6:\n> \n> * **Ethereum-aligned:** Arbitrum is part of the Ethereum ecosystem and community\n> * **Sustainable:** Focus on long-term health of the protocol over short-term gains\n> * **Secure:** Arbitrum is security minded\n> * **Socially inclusive:** Open and welcoming to all constructive participants\n> * **Technically inclusive:** Accessible for ordinary people with ordinary technology\n> * **User-focused:** Managed for the benefit of all users\n> * **Neutral and open:** Foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition\n> \n> ### 7.2 Good Faith and Best Interest\n> \n> * Contributors should conduct themselves with honesty, integrity, and transparency, fostering trust and confidence among community members.\n> * Contributors should act and vote in accordance with what they see is in the best interests of Arbitrum, which encompasses but is not limited to all of the following: Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, the Orbit Ecosystem, and any future Arbitrum DAO-governed chains as outlined above in Section 1.\n> \n> ### 7.3 Due Care and Attention\n> \n> * Contributors should remain knowledgeable of developments in regard to Arbitrum DAO\u2019s initiatives and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n> * Contributors should strive to make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal before submitting their vote.\n> * Contributors are advised to vote abstain when unable to conduct the necessary diligence to understand the proposals.\n> \n> ### 7.4 Civility and Professionalism\n> \n> * While separate from the Code of Conduct, contributors are expected to uphold the [community guidelines](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807) for activity on the Arbitrum DAO forum and de facto understood gathering places for the Arbitrum DAO, whether online or in-person.\n> * Contributors should seek to create a respectful and inclusive environment for all community members, free from harassment and discrimination.\n>   * Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:\n>     * Publicly or privately harassing or intimidating others\n>     * Sharing someone's private information without their consent\n>     * Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwanted advances\n>     * Making insulting or derogatory comments about others\n> * Contributors should strive to provide constructive feedback that is well-researched and respectful, focusing on the proposal's merits. Personal attacks are never acceptable.\n> * Contributors should be open-minded and respectful of differing viewpoints, even if they disagree with them. Disagreements are an inevitable part of healthy debate, but they often yield positive results when approached in a civil manner.\n> * Contributors should make a best effort to provide constructive feedback through appropriate channels and avoid taking discussions to social media in a manner that could tarnish Arbitrum DAO\u2019s brand and reputation.\n> * Contributors should avoid making unsubstantiated accusations that imply malice without proper evidence. They should conduct proper due diligence before making any public accusations via social media, public forums, or any other recognized communication channels. This includes exhausting all available avenues, such as seeking clarification privately, before issuing any public statement that contains an unsubstantiated accusation about another DAO contributor.\n> \n> ### 7.5 Responsibility\n> \n> * Maintaining a culture of productive debate, integrity, and transparency requires a sense of collective responsibility. As entrusted leaders of the Arbitrum community, contributors should take responsibility in fostering and maintaining a culture that promotes the principles outlined herein.\n> * Best practices of responsible contributors:\n>   * **Participation:** Contributors should make an effort to vote (even if they vote abstain) on all proposals.\n>   * **Communication:** Contributors should clearly communicate their rationale behind votes and discussions to the Arbitrum community.\n>   * **Accountability:** Contributors should maintain knowledge of all DAO initiatives and hold managing parties or elected representatives accountable.\n>   * **Responsiveness:** Contributors should use their best efforts to connect with the Arbitrum community and be accessible to answer questions or concerns.\n\n---\n\nFrom the previous iteration, the following language changes have been made to the Code of Conduct:\n\n1. In the previous iteration, participants were referred to as \u201cdelegates\u201d. This term has been updated to \u201ccontributor\u201d.\n2. Mention of the ARB token in section 7.2 has been removed.\n3. Language involving unsubstantiated accusations has been added to section 7.4: \u201cContributors should avoid making unsubstantiated accusations that imply malice without proper evidence. They should conduct proper due diligence before making any public accusations via social media, public forums, or any other recognized communication channels. This includes exhausting all available avenues, such as seeking clarification privately, before issuing any public statement that contains an unsubstantiated accusation about another DAO contributor.\u201c\n4. Examples of contributor resources have been removed from section 7.3. Given that these might change in the future, we determined it was too detailed for the Constitution.\n5. \u201cbut not limited to\u201d has been added in section 7.4 before the example list of unacceptable behavior.\n6. \u201cthey vote\u201d has been added to \u201c(even if they vote abstain)\u201d in the Participation definition of section 7.5.\n\nSections 7.1 through 7.5 outline enduring values and expectations appropriate for constitutional inclusion, while the clauses regarding Conflicts of Interest, Enforcement, and Conflict Resolution are more operational in nature. We envision that Conflicts of Interest disclosure policies, as well as enforcement and conflict resolution mechanisms may need to adapt over time based on active programs, contributor behavior, and evolving community standards. Embedding these specifics into the Constitution would limit the DAO\u2019s flexibility to make changes if necessary. Instead, both Entropy and the Arbitrum Foundation agree that it is more appropriate for these sections to live outside the Constitution in a similar manner to the agreed-upon Procedural Updates.\n\nIn the following sections, mentions of the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) have been generalized so that the terminology encompasses compensation from any DAO program that incentivizes voting or participation activity. Overall, the main changes have been made to the Enforcement & Appeal Process section. As the DAO\u2019s structure is currently rapidly evolving, we foresee that most paid executors will either be directly hired by the DAO as AAEs, working as service providers or contractors under an AAE, or elected into a council overseeing an AAE, with each structure having bespoke checks and balances in place to ensure that executors are behaving professionally and ethically.\n\n### Conflicts of Interest\n\n**Disclosure and Transparency Policy:** If a conflict of interest exists, it is expected that the contributor discloses the nature and extent of the conflict in writing on the forum before voting. Proposal authors should disclose potential conflicts in the COI section of the recommended proposal template as outlined in the [\u201cHow to Submit a DAO Proposal\u201d](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-to-submit-a-dao-proposal/13494) by the Arbitrum Foundation. While it may not always be clear if an individual/entity stands to gain \u201cdirectly\u201d or \u201cindirectly\u201d, contributors and proposal authors are recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency.\n\nContributors who disclose a conflict of interest are not expected to alter their voting in any way. Self-voting is not currently banned outright for the reasons stated in previous DAO-wide [discussions](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-create-coi-self-voting-policies/26062) and based on sentiment gathered from a subsequent [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbbec2fbf891d9abb21e8be380f79806519df8294d1d2cdce155d105fd1fed8db). However, a contributor who repeatedly fails to disclose a conflict of interest before voting risks being removed from their compensated governance role.\n\n### Enforcement & Appeal Process\n\nAll contributors are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct. Enforcement will take place through any program that financially compensates performing governance activities, such as rewards for voting/forum activity, or participation in DAO-approved programs where contributors are directly elected to facilitate the programs.\n\nThe program manager, council, or comparable facilitator in charge of the program is the one responsible for determining violations of the Code of Conduct and reserves the right to take what it deems as appropriate action, which may include but is not limited to, issuing a warning, suspension, or removal from the program. Any community member can raise a concern to the party responsible for managing the program with respect to a contributor failing to uphold the Code of Conduct. While the responsible party is required to acknowledge receipt of the concern and investigate the matter, the final determination and resulting course of action, which may include dismissing the concern, will depend on the underlying program\u2019s structure.\n\nIf there are contradictions between the Code of Conduct and the specific program that is compensating a contributor, then the policies of the program shall take precedence. It is assumed that a program will define its own appeal process, but if it does not, then the conflict resolution section (next) will be the default appeal approach.\n\n### Conflict Resolution\n\nResolution of conflicts between contributors (and between contributors and programs) will be entrusted to the Arbitrum Foundation, which will act as a neutral mediator. It is recommended that contributors first seek to resolve conflict issues in good faith and privately. If the matter is unable to be resolved for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, the matter can be raised to the Arbitrum Foundation using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHN5FLtcxWvB6oj3kqWcfAuxj0xuKlLI9A_ZU3G4tIZvDLLA/viewform). The Arbitrum Foundation will have the final say on the issue and reserves the right to determine if the issue should be brought to the attention of the community as a whole.\n\nIn the future and once OpCo is fully operational, responsibility for the resolution of conflicts can be transferred to the OpCo at the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s discretion. The Arbitrum Foundation will acknowledge when this transfer can take place and make it public on the governance forum when it goes into effect.\n\n## Changes to the DAO\u2019s Procedures\n\nEntropy proposes an extended pilot of the DAO's procedures through the end of January 2026 to evaluate three adjustments/additions: Removing the Responsible Voting policy due to the presence of vote-buying services and, if not defined in the original proposal, processes for both the replacement of a DAO-elected committee/council member that voluntarily steps down and the termination of an ongoing DAO initiative.\n\nRemaining unchanged from the previous iteration are the predictable voting schedule, the use of shielded voting for elections, and the inclusion of a Holiday Break at the end of the year. These changes reflect areas of feedback and allow the DAO to generate data across another trial period before making final decisions.\n\n### 1. Removing the Responsible Voting Policy\n\nEntropy recognizes that the complexity of the original policy created confusion for some participating candidates, especially in situations where there was only a single seat being filled through the election. Additionally, since the introduction of the policy, vote-buying services have become more common, and notably, LobbyFi has received substantial delegation. After observing the impact on the OAT election in particular, Entropy has concluded that enforcing the Responsible Voting Policy is no longer feasible. Participating candidates can effectively bypass the policy by sending funds to a fresh address to purchase or bid for additional votes, thus circumventing the original policy\u2019s intentions and putting other candidates strictly following the policy at a disadvantage.\n\nTherefore, Entropy is proposing to sunset the Responsible Voting Policy and return to the DAO\u2019s original standards of allowing participating candidates to self-vote with their full voting power. Staying consistent with the Disclosure and Transparency Policy, candidates who plan to self-vote should still disclose the action to the DAO. Remaining unchanged from the previous trial, contributors not participating in the election are free to vote however they wish, but if a conflict of interest exists, it should be disclosed on the forums before voting.\n\n### 2. DAO-Elected Member Replacement Process\n\nDue to the recent instances of elected members stepping away from positions, it became apparent that not having a pre-defined process for replacing DAO-elected committee members can lead to possible friction and uncertainty. In these instances, several paths were proposed by contributors, including a new DAO-wide election, taking the runner-up individual, the proposal author nominating a new member, or consolidating/elevating the responsibilities of an existing member.\n\nTo prevent the aforementioned uncertainty from arising in the future, Entropy is proposing the following process for the replacement of elected members who step down from a program when no process has been defined in the primary proposal passed to initiate an initiative:\n\n* If the initiative has an acting program manager or dedicated committee/council that manages the initiative, it is their responsibility to consult with all other involved parties to identify a suitable replacement or best path forward (including but not limited to possibly consolidating responsibilities across roles, renegotiating payment terms to reflect new duties, or not replacing a member due to the initiative coming to an end).\n* If the initiative has no program manager or dedicated committee/council, the responsibility falls to the author of the proposal. In this event, they are entrusted with the same flexibility as the program manager and can decide the best course of action.\n* If neither of these parties is suited to make the decision on member replacement, for the moment, the Arbitrum Foundation will be the determining party. Once ready, OpCo can assume this responsibility. Depending on the situation, the Arbitrum Foundation/OpCo may turn over the decision to the DAO and call for an election.\n\nWhichever party ultimately makes the decision on the best course of action, they are expected to provide a short update with rationale and basic information for the DAO.\n\nFor the purposes of clarity, we are proposing the above process only for positions that are filled by a DAO-wide election, and no dedicated process to replace a member has been defined in the original proposal. If an initiative has a program manager/council-appointed position that needs replacement or filling, due to either an individual stepping down or underperforming, it will be left up to the discretion of the initiative owner/manager.\n\n### 3. Voting Requirement for the Cancellation of Ongoing Initiatives\n\nRecently, several contributors have raised the question of whether a proposal to clawback funds or terminate an active DAO program should require a Snapshot with a certain quorum threshold (unconstitutional or constitutional) or an onchain vote. If not defined in the original proposal, we propose the following wind-down requirements as the default.\n\nA Snapshot vote where the number of FOR votes to wind down the initiative meets 3% of the votable supply. If there are more voting options than the basic FOR/AGAINST/ABSTAIN, the option with the largest number of votes will be applied, given that the options to modify/cancel an initiative together exceed the 3% of votable supply level. For the purpose of clarity, if a proposal only seeks to modify an existing initiative, this voting requirement will not apply.\n\nThe individual/entity that brings forward the proposal to cancel an ongoing initiative is expected to provide sufficient information and rationale to help inform the DAO of their intentions. Any individual/entity with the adequate 500k ARB of voting power to post a vote on Snapshot may move the proposal forward.\n\nWe believe that such a structure elevates the requirements for canceling an initiative in a manner that provides comparable legitimacy to an actual onchain vote.\n\n### 4. Extend the use of Shielded Elections\n\nEntropy has conducted an analysis of shielded voting, seeking to understand if participation rates or voting behavior changed. We have created a [dashboard](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/shielded-voting-analysis) that contributors can reference. It is important to note that several factors can impact the voting behavior of an election, including the number of seats, candidates, and its importance. We felt that the ARDC elections were the most appropriate instance to directly compare non-shielded and shielded elections. The following summarizes our findings:\n\n* **Stable engagement by large stakeholders:** Average participation by large voters (100k+ voting power) held nearly constant. 41 in public elections vs. 44 in shielded elections.\n* **Overall turnout decline reflects ecosystem-wide trends:** Unique voter count fell (28,164 to 3,520), but this mirrors the DAO-wide drop in unique voter engagement. We did not notice a major difference in the participation of shielded elections vs other recent proposals.\n* **11th-Hour Voting Slightly Increased:** Compared to public elections, late voting increased, with the share of votes cast in the final 24 hours rising in shielded elections. On average, 50.53% of the total VP was cast in the final 24 hours of a shielded election, up from an average of 41.59% in public elections. As mentioned above, Entropy is not confident that this is solely attributable to shielded voting, and could be partially due to the more predictable voting schedule with elections now being posted only on Thursdays.\n* **ARDC Case Study \u2013 V1 (Public) vs V2 (Shielded):** Early voting (days 1\u20133) dropped from ~30% to ~10% under shielded conditions, while day-7 activity surged. Nearly 60% of the total VP in V2 was cast on the final day.\n\nOverall, Entropy believes an extension of shielded voting will let us validate and examine the effects of shielded voting further. In **Part 3** of the dashboard, contributors are welcome to pick an Arbitrum DAO election to explore its activity.\n\nAs was the case during the 1st trial, shielded elections will only apply to those conducted on Snapshot and will not apply to the Security Council elections held on Tally.\n\n### 5. DAO Holiday Break: December 18th, 2025 - January 5th, 2026\n\nSimilar to last year, the purpose of a Holiday Break is to ensure that voters have a break and can return refreshed for the new year.\n\nProposal authors should be cognizant of timelines and aim to have all voting wrapped up by Thursday, December 18th if possible. To ensure this, temperature checks would have to start no later than Thursday, December 11th, 2025, and onchain votes scheduled by Monday, December 1st, 2025.\n\nDiffering from last year\u2019s holiday break, we believe it is acceptable for new proposals to be posted to the forum, but the DAO should aim to only put emergency proposals to vote during the period.\n\nEntropy recognizes that several proposals were delayed due to last year\u2019s holiday break, so it is our recommendation that a certain level of flexibility be accepted by contributors in the event some voting is not wrapped up exactly by December 18th. The primary motivation of such a timeline is to ensure no voting occurs during the especially busy holiday period of December 24th - January 1st.\n\n# Timeline\n\n* July 9th: Forum post\n* July 15th at 2 pm UTC: Open Discussion - Google Meets [Link](https://meet.google.com/zsn-yzjm-chx)\n* July 17th: Snapshot Vote\n* July 24th, 2025 - January 31st, 2026: 2nd Trial Period", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "c305a76c-72f7-4996-a4bf-9ec314230d89", "proposal_id": "0145ff08-0c72-44bc-b717-56093dbac7df", "snapshot_id": "0x4a96a91d162975de0d402b83ca8b8a24e808ca357150120fc0d44ae0bf1cc4a5", "title": "AIP: Raise the gas target, min L2 base fee, & implement improvements to the pricing algorithm", "author_name": "0xb4c064f466931B8d0F637654c916E3F203c46f13", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4a96a91d162975de0d402b83ca8b8a24e808ca357150120fc0d44ae0bf1cc4a5", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-11-13 16:55:00", "voting_end": "2025-11-20 16:55:00", "options": {"scores": [128065217.99775216, 3438.696204366795, 9209493.474572884], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-11-20 16:55:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:58.627", "body": "Constitutional proposal\n\n**Updated 10 November 2025:** This proposal has been amended to include an increase in the L2 min base fee from 0.01 gwei to 0.02 gwei. This change is proposed to be executed by an ArbOwner precompile call to the _setMinimumL2BaseFee_ function and will solely be a parameter/configuration change.\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP proposes to reduce the severity, frequency, and duration of high L2 gas prices during periods when demand exceeds the gas target by introducing a new set of gas targets and new, accompanying adjustment windows for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. The starting effective (lowest) gas target of the chain is proposed to be 10 Mgas/s with an adjustment period of 86,400 seconds (1 day). These changes are intended to replace the current 7 Mgas/s gas target, which is used to adjust the L2 gas price using an [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)-inspired algorithm relative to the current 102-second adjustment window.\n\nThe AIP requests that the ArbitrumDAO grant Offchain Labs the right (for 2-years, measured from this proposal\u2019s mainnet activation) to add up to 10 gas targets and adjustment windows, and to modify them over time\u2014up to 100 Mgas/s and 86,400s, respectively. These changes will be introduced gradually to protect network stability while addressing high gas price volatility. The rollout begins with 6 new gas targets, each paired with its own adjustment window.\n\nLastly, this AIP is accompanied by an increase in the minimum L2 base fee from 0.01 gwei/gas to 0.02 gwei/gas to help reduce spam and offset any potential decline in the portion of L2 surplus fee-derived transaction fees (during periods of peak demand) to the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThese updates and delegated rights are proposed by Offchain Labs in its role as an Arbitrum Aligned Entity (AAE), as described in [_A Vision for the Future of Arbitrum_](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-vision-for-the-future-of-arbitrum/28962). Offchain Labs serves as an AAE for engineering, product, business development, and technical research.\n\nAll changes will be gated through smart contracts and DAO votes. Activation will require an on-chain vote, a security audit, and deployment of a new Resource Constraint Manager contract to manage permissions. If approved, only Offchain Labs will be authorized to adjust the parameters within the approved limits.\n\nThe proposal also outlines the rationale, risks, tradeoffs, and supporting data behind these changes. It applies solely to ArbitrumDAO-owned chains\u2014Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n## **Rationale**\n\n**How gas costs are priced today**\n\nArbitrum chains determine transaction gas fees using two components:\n\n1.  L1 gas costs \u2013 the expense of posting data to the parent chain.\n    \n2.  L2 gas costs \u2013 the resources consumed on the child chain (computation and storage).\n    \n\nL1 gas costs depend on the price of calldata or blobs on the parent chain, while L2 gas costs depend on network demand. Today, when demand on Arbitrum One exceeds 7 MGas/s, the L2 base fee increases exponentially \u2014 using a mechanism similar to Ethereum\u2019s [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) \u2014 until demand falls back toward the gas target over a 102-second adjustment window. Learn more about Arbitrum\u2019s gas model [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/gas-fees).\n\n**Negative impacts of elevated demand**\n\nDuring periods of high activity, L2 gas prices can rise sharply, which significantly increases transaction costs for users and developers. For example, on Oct. 10, 2025, Arbitrum One\u2019s L2 gas price peaked at an average of 41 gwei/gas, resulting in roughly $9.49 in L2 gas costs to transfer an ERC-20 token ([source](https://app.hex.tech/8bb08a30-5c58-48c4-acb0-5a0515db9db2/app/030GmGbKtvc6FtI1jIYB5h/latest), and assumes 60,000 gas and a price of $3,855 per Ether).\n\nThese high L2 gas price spikes are the motivation behind this AIP: to mitigate the frequency and severity of congestion-driven cost increases. Notably, introducing multiple gas targets with overlapping adjustment windows has a greater combined effect on stabilizing prices than raising a single gas target or changing a single adjustment window alone.\n\n**Illustrative example**\n\nTo illustrate this, we analyzed how the L2 gas price would have changed during the demand surge on Oct. 10, 2025 and on Sept 22, 2025, under different gas targets and adjustment windows. The adjustment window is a time-based damping parameter that controls how slowly the L2 gas price responds to changes in demand on the network above the gas target. A larger adjustment window results in slower price adjustments relative to the gas target, while a smaller adjustment window results in faster price adjustments.\n\n![OCL Image 1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihunmtusohodn7qkygzzpxsqhdfooyuz5ehki7z4mmpcwe6zulzfa)\n\n_Figure 1: L2 gas prices calculated different pricing algorithms during a period of high congestion on Sept 22, 2025_\n\n![OCL Image 2.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreig2rpsqqkt57s5gsorcjmxurth2ldikg3l7mjiveiuphguvic2iia)\n\n_Figure 2: L2 gas prices from different pricing algorithms during a period of high congestion on Oct 10, 2025_\n\nBelow is a brief description of the colored lines and what they represent in each of the two figures above, while holding the minimum L2 base fee constant\n\n-   **Red lines:** Actual L2 gas price using today\u2019s parameters (effective gas target of 7 MGas/s over a 102-second adjustment window), peaking near 4 gwei on Sept 22 (Figure 1) and 42 gwei on Oct 10 (Figure 2).\n    \n-   **Blue lines:** L2 prices using the new set of proposed gas targets and adjustment windows, with an effective 7 MGas/s target and 86,400-second window.\n    \n-   **Green lines:** L2 prices using the new set of proposed gas targets and adjustment windows, with an effective 10 MGas/s target and 86,400-second window.\n    \n\nLooking specifically at Figure 2 during the period of peak demand on October 10, 2025, notice how both the green and the blue lines produce a much lower L2 gas price of ~9 gwei during the same demand peak, representing a ~33 gwei difference when compared to the peak of the red line (which uses today\u2019s single 7 Mgas/s gas target and 102-second adjustment window). The difference between the peaks is almost ~33 gwei (129% difference) despite the effective gas targets being very close. Both the green and blue lines show substantially lower peak prices \u2014 around 9 gwei \u2014 a 33 gwei (\u2248129%) reduction compared to the current configuration, despite similar effective gas targets.\n\n**Summary and the increase in the minimum L2 base fee**\n\nThis retrospective analysis shows that applying the proposed gas targets and adjustment windows would have significantly reduced L2 gas prices during the periods of peak demand on Sept 22, 2025 and Oct. 10, 2025. While this simulation does not predict future outcomes, it demonstrates that longer and overlapping adjustment windows can meaningfully dampen gas price volatility during periods of high demand.\n\nNaturally, this change will mean that during periods of peak demand, the portion of L2 surplus fee-derived transaction fees collected by the ArbitrumDAO will be lower going forward, compared to before. To offset this potential decline, this proposal is to be accompanied by a slight increase in the minimum L2 base fee from 0.01 gwei/gas to 0.02 gwei/gas. This slight increase in the minimum L2 base fee can also positively contribute to reducing spam on the network as well, since the base fee for all transactions will be slightly larger than before this change.\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n**New gas targets and adjustment windows**\n\nThis proposal replaces the current, singular gas target (7 Mgas/s over a 102-second adjustment window) with multiple gas targets across overlapping adjustment windows, as tabulated in Table 1 below.\n\n**Table 1: Proposed gas targets & accompanying adjustment windows**\n\n| Gas Target (Mgas/s) | Adjustment window (seconds) |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 60                  | 9                           |\n| 41                  | 52                          |\n| 29                  | 329                         |\n| 20                  | 2,105                       |\n| 14                  | 13,485                      |\n| 10                  | 86,400                      |\n\n\nThese values were calculated using this model [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D28YghOmCjvvrLWS5FsTp5xNKz9JHAA3?usp=sharing), with inputs from internal benchmarking on a server hosted by a cloud provider. This model assumes that a node on the reference hardware can sustainably sync at 80 MGas/s and that the chain can tolerate a 20% increase in L2 gas price per second during periods of high demand. Reference hardware used for these tests was: 64 GB RAM, 8 CPUs (x86 architecture), and a locally attached NVMe drive (for AWS, [i4i.2xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/i4i/)). Note that the lowest gas target of the 6 being introduced is 10 Mgas/s, which will be measured over the longest adjustment window (86,400s). We refer to this proposed 10 Mgas/s gas target as the \u201clong-term gas target\u201d or \u201ceffective gas target\u201d of the chain..\n\n**Special permissions to gradually adjust gas targets and adjustment windows, over time**\n\nSeparately, this proposal requests the ArbitrumDAO grant Offchain Labs permission, for 2 years from the mainnet activation of this proposal, to adjust the gas targets and adjustment windows in Table 1, in addition to the right to add up to 10 more gas targets and adjustment values. These rights will allow Offchain Labs to adjust these values over time and help the chain\u2019s stability in a way that security is not negatively impacted as additional capacity is added. The rollout of these changes will be paired with continuous monitoring of how the user behavior, node operators, and the network itself respond to them. Summarized below in Table 1 are the values and ranges that this proposal grants Offchain Labs the right to adjust.\n\nTable 2: Proposed gas targets and adjustment window ranges that can be adjusted over time by Offchain Labs, should the permission be granted by the ArbitrumDAO\n\n| Parameter              | Range                                  | Status quo value |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Number of gas targets  | 1 to 10, inclusive                     | 1                |\n| Gas targets            | 7 Mgas/s to 100 Mgas/s, inclusive      | 7 Mgas/s         |\n| Adjustment windows     | 5 seconds to 86,400 seconds, inclusive | 102 seconds      |\n\n\n**Resource Constraint Manager Contract**\n\nLastly, if approved, there will be a new contract deployed called the ResourceConstraintManager that will give Offchain Labs the appropriate permissions to adjust the above values within the specified ranges in Table 2 over time, should this proposal pass. This new contract will be audited by an independent third party entity (Trail of Bits). A full audit report will be published alongside this proposal when it gets proposed in the eventual on-chain vote.\n\nThis new contract will contain an access list. We propose that the ArbitrumDAO use this access to designate Offchain Labs the right to invoke specific functions on the ArbOwner precompile to adjust the above values in Table 2, within certain ArbitrumDAO-approved bounds. Normally, ArbOwner parameter changes and function calls require an ArbitrumDAO vote. Implementing this ResourceConstraintManager contract will allow Offchain Labs to adjust these parameters in Table 2, within the proposed bounds, without the need for additional votes - should the ArbitrumDAO pass this proposal.\n\n**Changing the minimum L2 base fee**\n\nA change to the minimum L2 base fee is also included in this proposal and will be executed via a call to the ArbOwner _setMinimumL2BaseFee_ function. This will be a one-time adjustment from the current 0.01 gwei value to a new 0.02 gwei value.\n\n**Risks & Tradeoffs**\n\nThe addition of new, higher gas targets to a chain is not without tradeoffs. Below are some of the potential tradeoffs that the ArbitrumDAO and ecosystem should consider in their assessment of this proposal.\n\n#### **Accelerated state growth**\n\nA gas target increase translates to an increase to the demand threshold at which EIP-1559-style congestion pricing kicks in, which will invite more demand to the network. After profiling the type of gas used on Arbitrum One over a period of about 3 weeks, the gas rate associated with state growth was observed to remain [relatively stable over time](https://blog.arbitrum.io/dynamic-pricing-explainer/). It is believed that if the capacity of the chain increases, then the rate of storage growth is expected to also increase.\n\nWhile this issue presents a challenge regarding the size of the state database and the costs to maintain it over the long run (e.g., archive node operators), after careful consideration, we believe the below are sufficient justifications that support the current proposed course of action.\n\n1.  In September 2025, the [Erigon team announced](https://erigon.tech/introducing-erigon-nitro-for-arbitrum-sepolia/) the alpha release of their archive node support for Arbitrum Sepolia. Their team was able to reduce the Arbitrum Sepolia archive node size from 12 TB to 0.732 TB, a 94% reduction. The Erigon team is expected to deliver Arbitrum One mainnet support by Q1 2026. This achievement will mean that node operators can opt to run archive nodes using Erigon, significantly reducing the cost associated with maintaining a larger and faster-growing state database size (when compared to today\u2019s Geth-based Nitro nodes).\n    \n2.  The majority of professional node operators surveyed run Arbitrum One nodes on bare-metal providers and in [RAID0 configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels). This special type of setup grants node operators the flexibility and optionality to expand storage at more predictable (and sometimes lower) costs and in a horizontal fashion. Based on this information, we expect professional node operators to be able to adequately provision and scale up in their disk sizes over time.\n    \n3.  [In September 2025, AWS announced that it raised the limit on EBS GP3 volumes to 64 TB, up from 16 TB](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/09/amazon-ebs-size-provisioned-performance-gp3-volumes/). Given that some instance families (e.g., i8g) have an upper bound of 32 EBS volumes, then the theoretical maximum that a node operator could provision on AWS would be 32 x 64 TB = 2048 TB. For NVMe drives, which we recommend for performance and latency today already, some instances offered by AWS go as high as 120 TB ([i8g](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/i8g/)) and 45 TB ([i7ie](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/i7i/)). We expect that cost reductions and other advancements to technology will continue to improve across all cloud providers, making access to these larger drives more affordable as time goes on (i.e., [Moore\u2019s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law)).\n    \n\nThe combination of the above 3 trends leads us to conclude that the risk of accelerated state growth, as a result of increased demand, can be reasonably managed in both the short and long term.\n\n#### **Updated minimum hardware requirements for node operators**\n\nAs noted in Table 1, the proposed starting gas targets and adjustment windows were computed using test results observed from syncing an Arbitrum node on reference hardware. The reference hardware used in these tests was 64 GB RAM, 8 CPUs (x86), and a locally attached NVMe drive formatted with ext4 (for AWS, i4i.2xlarge). Therefore, this proposal will accompany an increase in the minimum hardware requirements for node operators from the current specification. These requirements will be used as the foundation for future increases to the tech stack\u2019s scaling capabilities.\n\nTable 3: Comparison of current and new minimum hardware requirements for Arbitrum Nitro full nodes, given the new gas targets being proposed\n\n| Arbitrum Nitro full node hardware requirements | Current (source) minimum | Proposed new minimum |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Total RAM (GB)                                | 16                       | 64                   |\n| Number of CPUs                                | 4                        | 8                    |\n| Disk type                                     | Local NVMe drive         | Local NVMe drive     |\n\n\nDespite the cost increases that come with higher hardware minimums, we believe that this increase is justified because:\n\n1.  [Surveys conducted with at-home node operators](https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1043523039104606239/1418980839366201344) found that the majority of teams are already running Arbitrum Nitro full nodes on servers that have 12+ CPU cores, 64GB+ RAM, and NVMe drives. As such, we believe this change will bring the requirements in line with setups that teams use today.\n    \n2.  The current minimum CPU and RAM requirements for running an Arbitrum Nitro node were defined [over 3 years ago](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs/pull/85). As technology has improved and costs have decreased, we believe it makes sense to update this requirement to align with what the market can offer today at a similar price.\n    \n3.  Future chain capacity increases will benefit from better hardware, and so this update will establish a new baseline for how we scale Arbitrum technology in the future\n    \n\nOver the coming weeks, we will perform similar benchmarking tests on various other types of hardware using different workloads to understand the limitations of the Nitro node software. The results of these upcoming tests will help us further improve Arbitrum technology.\n\n#### **Spam, relative to organic traffic, could increase on Arbitrum One**\n\nAs mentioned above, a gas target increase translates to an increase to the demand threshold at which L2 congestion pricing kicks in. Doing this naturally invites more demand to the network and could, therefore, result in more spam relative to organic traffic and today\u2019s level of spam, since there would be more capacity to transact on the chain. While spam can be monitored, it is difficult to predict exactly how much more spam could take place on the network as a result of this change, relative to organic traffic.\n\nTo counteract the potential increase in spam, Entropy Advisors, an Arbitrum Aligned Entity (AAE), has suggested this proposal be accompanied with a change in the minimum L2 base fee from 0.01 gwei to 0.02 gwei. This change is based on the assumption that inorganic demand (generated from bots or spam) are more price sensitive compared to organic demand.\n\nCareful monitoring and subsequent changes to the gas targets and their adjustment windows will be considered over time to better manage spam. We acknowledge that there is no single, one-size-fits-all solution to eliminating or reducing spam, and so this area remains a topic of ongoing research at Offchain Labs.\n\n#### **Slight increase in transaction costs**\n\nAn increase in the minimum L2 base fee will result in, overall, higher transaction costs for all users during all periods, assuming usage remains the same. However, we believe this change (from 0.01 gwei/gas to 0.02 gwei/gas) is small enough that regular users and applications will largely be unaffected. To illustrate this, a simple ETH transfer consumes 21,000 gas. At $3500 USD per ETH, this increase in the minimum L2 base fee would result in a ~ $0.000735 increase in cost for an end user (0.01 gwei/gas * 21,000 gas * 1e-9 gwei/ETH * $3500 ETH = ~$0.000735).\n\n## **Steps to Implement & Timelines**\n\nIf approved, these changes will be deployed with the values in Table 1, accompanied by continuous monitoring of the network and its response to the changes. With permission from the ArbitrumDAO, Offchain Labs may adjust these values over time to help maintain the stability and security of the network as the chain\u2019s capacity increases.\n\nBelow are the approximate next steps and timelines for this proposal:\n\n1.  Formal submission to the ArbitrumDAO for consideration and assessment (this post)\n    \n2.  Discussion and productive iteration together with the community (1 week)\n    \n3.  Development and audit, by Trail of Bits, of the required changes to add multiple gas targets and adjustment windows, alongside the actual proposed starting parameter values (now through mid-November 2025)\n    \n4.  Temperature check vote on Snapshot (mid-November 2025)\n    \n5.  Arbitrum Sepolia upgrade to ArbOS 50, should the temperature check vote pass successfully (mid- to late-November 2025)\n    \n6.  Submission for inclusion in the ArbOS 50 on-chain vote (carried out on Tally) (early December 2025), should the temperature check vote pass successfully, alongside the publication of the audit report from Trail of Bits.\n    \n\n## **Overall costs**\n\nAll engineering and research conducted for this proposal was done so by Offchain Labs at no explicit or additional costs to the ArbitrumDAO", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "c326d800-faed-4405-9fe5-aa33182aba0a", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x5ee25b6d2de2c7a4a93672c8a483efd249e961e800f21303a102b80a14b01c45", "title": "Poolside LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0x18BF1a97744539a348304E9d266aAc7d446a1582", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5ee25b6d2de2c7a4a93672c8a483efd249e961e800f21303a102b80a14b01c45", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [155599376.11394274, 61140.88817319884, 4430307.789595037], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.42", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/poolside-ltipp-application-draft/22060\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nPoolside provided a solid application that scored decently across most criteria.

The protocol is relatively young, with modest success in attracting users. This proposal would be considerably strengthened if the applicants identified clear mechanisms that have led to some initial success or momentum, and then craft the grant program around expanding or leveraging those mechanisms for sustained growth, rather than simply putting an APY target on LPing the major assets they already support without much differentiation.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nPoolside is a recently established protocol that has yet to gain significant traction. It aims to streamline the integration of yield-bearing assets within the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem while safeguarding Liquidity Providers against foreseeable losses, addressing a prevalent concern in DeFi.

We recommend approving this grant.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n\nWe are generally supportive of approving Hop\u2019s grant. Hop Protocol is a substantial player in the bridge sector and has huge potential to help Arbitrum grow generally. Bridges are also sites of high crosschain traffic, so this provides an opportunity to put Artbiutrm in front of new users. The detailed breakdown of how the grant will be utilized, including specific percentages allocated to different aspects such as liquidity mining incentives, gas fee subsidies, and bonder fee subsidies, demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The plan to incentivize user \"stickiness\" by subsidizing onboarding fees while ensuring a stake in the network through ARB token rebates is particularly innovative and likely to achieve long-term engagement. They, are also open to match the grants funds with the HOP protocol DAO treasury funds which is a good sign. \n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nHop presented a strong application that scored well on most sections in this rubric.

Rather than formally updating the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, the chosen guidelines can be seen as a common social agreement between delegates. This proposal carries no cost to the DAO, and the guidelines can be implemented by the start of August if passed through a Snapshot vote.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince its inception, the Arbitrum DAO has voted on over 280 Snapshots and 30 onchain votes. First anticipated almost a [year](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-1-time-management-in-arbitrumdao-governance/15718) ago by Cattin and Seedlatam, as the operations of the DAO continue to grow, a more efficient and predictable governance process is needed to prevent delegate fatigue.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOur team considered several possibilities for structuring Arbitrum DAO\u2019s governance processes. This included creating voting periods organized around a monthly calendar or continuously repeating three week cycles. While both of those structures would greatly increase predictability and allow for the possibility of predetermined rest periods, they each come with tradeoffs:\n\n* Condensing the availability of when a proposal can be posted to a vote creates an incentive to rush proposals. This can be detrimental to overall proposal quality.\n* There is the potential to induce delegate fatigue if there is an overwhelming amount of votes all pushed into one short period.\n  * Limiting the number of votes in each batch opens up further questions on how to prioritize which proposals are included.\n* The DAO has typically [seen](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915) a 14 day application window for RFPs. Ensuring elections begin in a timely manner post RFP is an additional consideration that adds complexity to any designed structure.\n\nPrevious conversations on the DAO\u2019s process have also included introducing [standard guidelines for elections](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915) or an Arbitrum Delegate Code of Conduct. These are topics that Entropy Advisors is beginning to work on as well, but in this case we believe it is better to start by leaning on the side of simplicity.\n\nKnowing that more complex structures can always be implemented later, below we propose the adoption of a set day each week for votes to start as well as a holiday break. Both of these would greatly increase predictability for delegates and can be adopted by the DAO without much of an adjustment period.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThis proposal does not seek to alter the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, but rather create an agreed upon social contract between delegates on best practices in regards to posting proposals to a Snapshot or Tally vote.\n\nOur primary objective is to improve predictability and reduce the potential for delegate fatigue. Based on these priorities below are specifications for the two recommended adjustments to Arbitrum DAO\u2019s governance processes.\n\n### Start all votes on Thursdays\n\nBy starting both Snapshot and Tally votes on Thursday, the DAO can not only increase predictability for delegates, but also prevent the scenario where votes begin/end on weekends.\n\nIn order for a Tally vote to start on Thursday, it must be posted on Monday given the 3-day delay from when a proposal is posted until voting begins. Each batch of proposals ready to move to a Snapshot vote can be scheduled beforehand beginning on Monday and through Wednesday. We encourage delegates to post/schedule votes to begin before Thursday at 12 pm UTC. While not a hard deadline, this will help ensure any votes start for a majority of delegates worldwide.\n\nOverall, this allows delegates who don\u2019t follow discussions as closely a few days to see what will be voted on and properly prepare. Additionally, with multiple opportunities each month to move a proposal forward to a vote, the incentive to rush the process is reduced.\n\n### Holiday Break: December 20 - January 6th\n\nImplement a holiday break to ensure delegates have a break and can return refreshed for the new year. During this time it is advised that no new proposals are posted to the forums and only emergency proposals are put up to a vote.\n\n### Optional: Delegate Approval Process\n\nRecently, we have noticed a trend within Arbitrum DAO of delegates waiting until a proposal makes it to a Snapshot for feedback to be given. This has resulted in some proposals being posted to Snapshot prematurely. We assume this is a result of several factors including the increasing amount of topics delegates must stay up to date on and the fact that there are no specific guidelines on how much discussion is required before moving a proposal forward.\n\nIt would likely be very difficult to achieve DAO wide consensus on what specific requirements should be implemented to determine when a proposal is ready to move to a Snapshot vote. Thus a level of subjectivity is required and taking inspiration from procedures within Optimism DAO, a delegate approval process can be adopted.\n\nThere are currently 64 delegates with greater than 500k in voting power (VP), so our recommended threshold for delegate approval is 4 delegates. Once a proposal obtains this threshold it can be considered that there is consensus among enough delegates that it is ready to move forward.\n\nTo signal their support of a proposal, delegates can post a statement similar to the following: \u201cI am an Arbitrum delegate with xx voting power and believe this proposal is ready to move forward to Snapshot\u201d. Delegates should also link their Tally profile so that it is easy to verify their VP.\n\nThis approach introduces its own set of tradeoffs. While it would likely prevent premature proposals from going to a Snapshot vote, it does increase delegate responsibilities and can risk proposals authored by new contributors getting stuck due to the lack of connections to large delegates. Therefore we are presenting this as an option separate from the aforementioned adoptions and would welcome feedback from the community.\n\nTo help encourage delegates to take on this additional responsibility, as part of the [delegate incentive program](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/) a bonus point can be awarded to delegates on Karma who approve a proposal that eventually passes on Snapshot or Tally. This is just a suggestion and something we will leave to the discretion of the Seed Latam team.\n\n### Additional Considerations: Emergency Proposals\n\nIn the event of an emergency proposal that is time-sensitive in nature we recommend that any adopted guidelines be waived and the proposal be put up to a vote immediately. In our opinion, only Constitutional AIPs that relate to security matters should be considered as emergency proposals.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nAny changes made to the DAO\u2019s procedures need to be widely communicated and accessible for potential new members. Otherwise, there are minimal steps needed to implement other than coordinating delegates and helping the DAO adjust to the adopted changes.\n\nEntropy will also be responsible for:\n\n* Adding the agreed upon guidelines to the [Ground Rules Topic](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/ground-rules/10) so that it is easy for new community members to discover and access. Our team will coordinate with the Foundation to make this happen.\n* Adding the holiday break to the Arbitrum DAO [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).\n\n## Timeline\n\nBelow is a proposed timeline to help ensure a smooth transition and adequate preparation for all delegates and community members.\n\n#### Feedback Period (June 24th - July 11th)\n\nTaking into account GovHack (July 5-7) and EthCC (8-11), we have proposed a longer feedback period so as to not hold a vote when several delegates will be traveling. These events also present an opportunity to gather additional feedback in person.\n\n#### Snapshot: July 11th - 18th\n\n#### Voting Options: Ranked Choice\n\n* FOR: Improving Predictability\n* FOR: Improving Predictability and Delegate Approval Process\n* AGAINST\n* ABSTAIN\n\n#### Preparation Period: July 18th - July 28th\n\nAssuming the proposal passes the Snapshot vote, preparation for the first batch of proposals to align with the new schedule. We recommend that no Snapshot votes are posted after July 21st to help ensure a smooth transition for the first batch to begin August 1st.\n\n#### First Tally Votes Scheduled: July 29th\n\n#### First Batch of Snapshot Votes: August 1st\n\n## Costs\n\nThere are no additional costs to the DAO for implementing this proposal. The primary resources required will be the time required to update and coordinate with delegates on whatever new schedule is decided upon. This will be handled by the Entropy Advisors team.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe wanted to also extend our gratitude to Cattin and the Seed Latam team for providing valuable feedback and assistance with this proposal.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "c6fd1069-55d7-48c1-89fe-a4db1257d3bb", "proposal_id": "ece50e3c-1bed-4a88-ac9b-0c1f8ec063bc", "snapshot_id": "0x23985f3bb58758f0f43c5248085f6b7f1783c8e205604262336d043558aeca0c", "title": "Research on context and retention", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x23985f3bb58758f0f43c5248085f6b7f1783c8e205604262336d043558aeca0c", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-09-26 22:19:12", "voting_end": "2024-10-03 22:19:12", "options": {"scores": [134309903.31665128, 3417807.923247139, 1530029.6498930445], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-10-03 22:19:12", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.964", "body": "**Non-Constitutional**\n\n# Abstract\n\nTogetherCrew is a project, incubated in RnDAO, that aims to empower communities with their data. With a team of network scientists, TogetherCrew is **researching how Web3 social networks behave, with a special emphasis on retaining new community members and community health**.\n\nTogetherCrew is requesting read access to Arbitrum\u2019s Discourse and Discord API to run an analysis with our partners (researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara) and present it to the community for research purposes.\n\nFor clarity, this analysis **ONLY uses data that is already publicly available. No private data will be collected.** No data will be sold to third parties nor used without consent.\n\nThis proposal also allows us to test Hivemind, a bot that reads public data from Discourse and Discord and allows community members to ask questions: e.g. \"has anyone discussed the topic of Treasury management before?\" or \"What were the most common objections to proposals related to incentives?\".\n\n**No budget is required** as this research has already been funded through other sources (academic grants and previous Web3 grants from Aave, Aragon, Celo, Pocket Network and MetaCartel to develop the data pipelines, infrastructure, and previous [research on community helath](https://rndao.mirror.xyz/F-SMj6p_jdYvrMMkR1d9Hd6YbEg39qItTKfjo-zkgqM)).\n\n# Motivation\n\nOur understanding of Web3 social networks is still in its infancy. Studying the configuration of a social network and its impact on member retention could yield valuable insights to improve the resilience of Web3 communities.\n\nAdditionally, the social network mapping analysis gives us a potential tool to identify high-context community members (e.g. a recent analysis of Optimism\u2019s community enabled their community team to [identify potential community ambassadors](https://medium.com/togethercrew/case-study-how-optimism-added-science-to-the-art-of-community-management-dfab84727a6c) who had been missed). This analysis could be used to suggest members to invite to the offsite (non-binding, just as an exploratory analysis).\n\n# Specifications\n\nWe care about data privacy. We only collect data that is already in the public domain (e.g. public discourse posts yes, but not the email addresses associated with their account). Feedback was provided by the Arbiturm Foundation on our [privacy policy ](https://www.togethercrew.com/privacy-policy)and [terms of service](https://www.togethercrew.com/terms-of-service).\n\nThe solution is based on an (open-source) bot that will get read access to selected community platforms (for now Discourse and public channels in Discord). This bot has already been deployed in 100+ communities, including Optimism, Celo, Aave, Aragon, Shardeum, etc. **The permissions are configured to be low-risk** (no admin permission, no managing channels, etc. so even if the bot was hacked, the discord and discourse servers wouldn't be compromised) and we have battle-tested for scalability and reliability.\n\nThe analyses of the data are performed by the TogetherCrew team of scientists and our research partners at the University of California Santa Barbara. Those handling the data have undergone ethical data management training and could lose their academic credentials for unethical conduct.\n\nThe architecture has been developed by our tech lead who\u2019s ex-Accenture and built a data startup in the medical industry. So although the data we manage is low risk (no private data, only public handles, etc.) we\u2019re still investing in data security progressively.\n\nWe don\u2019t use the data to train any AI models. Some analyses might use AI, in which case we favour open-source models that don\u2019t feed on user data.\n\n**Changes to the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy:**\nTogetherCrew currently has no changes planed, but should a change be planned, TogetherCrew will give a minimum of 2 weeks' notice to the DAO, via a new proposal post, before such changes take effect. Thus allowing any delegate to submit a snapshot vote to suspend the service if desired.\n\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nA favourable snapshot vote will give the foundation the permission to give us read access to the Discourse API and public Discord channels. No further actions are required. We'll present our findings to the community (progressively over 1-3 months).\nAdditionally, we'll run a pilot of Hivemidn which uses this same data to answer community questions.\n\n# Budget\n\n**No budget requested**\n\nWe do hope in the future to develop additional functionalities communities would pay for. E.g.:\n\nIn parnterhip with SingulairtyNET we\u2019ve been developing [Hivemind](https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/hivemind-augmented-qa-bot-and-p2p-knowledge-base/) - an AI-powered Q&A bot that acts as a research assistant enabling community members to ask questions such as:\n* \u201cHow do I participate in governance?\u201d\n* \u201cHas anyone proposed something on topic XYZ?\u201d\n* \u201cWhat was discussed last month while I was away\u201d\n* etc.\n\nAnd funded by the Arbitrum questbook program we\u2019re also developing [Dynamic Reputation NFTs](https://new.questbook.app/dashboard/?role=builder&chainId=10&grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&proposalId=0x62b&isRenderingProposalBody=true), where members who desire to do so can mint their context score onchain. Thos who don\u2019t desire it, don\u2019t need to take any action, the NFTs are opt-in only.\n\nFor now, the solution is made available free of charge.\n\n**Had there been a previous proposal?**\nWe had posted about this some time ago but didn\u2019t move forward with it. Now with the discussion around context we\u2019re curious to explore that and see if we can provide a solution to the DAO.\n\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-health-analytics-and-reputation-nfts-in-arbitrumdao/24859", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "c7edfc62-7dbd-496e-9401-b897b67e6f80", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x2c0125737bfe7d3575a7ff93dd9f375f3cbf5b76ae6f40a3138379df7cc9d6e0", "title": "Tradao - LTIPP [Post Council Feedback]", "author_name": "0xd333Bc5c9670C9cEb18f9A2CF02C6E86807a8227", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2c0125737bfe7d3575a7ff93dd9f375f3cbf5b76ae6f40a3138379df7cc9d6e0", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-25 16:47:59", "voting_end": "2024-05-02 16:47:59", "options": {"scores": [31154076.5954282, 12350685.735389424, 89403113.31946994], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-05-02 16:47:59", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.338", "body": "Following the initial feedback of LTIPP Council, Tradao would like to re-submit its LTIPP application.\n\nThe full proposal can be found here:\n\n[https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tradao-ltipp-application-final/21884](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tradao-ltipp-application-final/21884)\n\n## Request: 100,000 $ARB (Reduced from 190,000 $ARB)\n\n### Feedback Summary:\n\nThe council feedback could be summarized as:\n\n1.

Found the grant request to be inefficient and the incentive strategies unproven.\n\n3. GFX: Highlighted concerns about the large grant size and the challenge in verifying Tradao's metrics. Recommended revising the application with enhanced sybil protection measures and to consider feedback from multiple reviewers for a future submission.\n\n### Key Metric Update\n\nAs Tradao's permissionless copy trading function launched in early March before the LTIPP application program deadline, the metric of copy trading cannot fully reflect our product-market fit.

This means all the costs are the gas fee and the fee charged by GMX. We will rebate 80% of open fees back to users.

The initial phase, which ends on August 20, 2024, was a proof of concept that established a comprehensive procurement process to support Arbitrum DAO's decentralized governance structure. This second phase, starting upon the successful on-chain vote, aims to build on the successes and lessons learned from the pilot phase, with a focus on delivering strategic procurement benefits for the DAO.\n\n## Key Achievements in Phase I:\nDuring its first phase, the ADPC successfully implemented procurement frameworks and marketplaces uniquely tailored for Arbitrum DAO, creating a foundation for cost savings and operational efficiency. Through the development of a solid legal and operational infrastructure, the committee has positioned Arbitrum DAO as a leader not just in the technical sphere but also in decentralized governance. The pilot phase showcased the benefits of using advanced sourcing methodologies and well-structured procurement to enhance the DAO\u2019s operations.\n_______________________\n## Plans for Phase II:\n\n### 1. Procurement for Two Key Vertical Sectors:\n\n**Vertical 1:** Focused on procuring RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on thorough engagement with DAO delegates and stakeholders, identifying RPC services as a core requirement for projects in the ecosystem.\n\n**Vertical 2:** Aims to manage procurement for events scheduled within the DAO's Events Strategy for 2025. The ADPC will work in collaboration with Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe, though no separate funding will be requested for event services in this proposal. The ADPC will create evaluation criteria, publish a request for proposals (RFP), and evaluate responses from potential suppliers. However, contract negotiations will not be handled by the ADPC, as they will fall under the purview of the Arbitrum Foundation or other third parties involved.\n\n### 2. Continued Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services:\nBuilding on the success of the initial cohort, the ADPC will continue overseeing the security services fund and will publish a proposal for its extension.\n\n### 3. Operational Expense (OpEx) Budget Creation:\nThe ADPC will define and propose an OpEx budget for the Arbitrum DAO, which will be managed by the Multi-Signature Safe (MSS). This will allow the DAO to use services from whitelisted providers without needing to undergo the full proposal process (Forum, Snapshot, On-Chain). The proposal will include multiple budget options for the community to vote on, allowing flexibility in how the budget is allocated.\n\n### 4. Phase II Outcome Report:\nUpon completion of the second phase, the ADPC will publish a detailed report outlining the results and key achievements, similar to the one produced for Phase I. This report will be submitted to the DAO for review.\n\n### 5. Alignment with DAO Stakeholders:\nThe ADPC will continue to engage with key stakeholders within the DAO to ensure that it remains aligned with the evolving governance structure of Arbitrum, particularly as the DAO explores potential changes like establishing an operating company (OpCo). The ADPC will also handle ad-hoc tasks, such as connecting whitelisted service providers with new projects or proposals within the DAO.\n\n### 6. Optional Additional Vertical Sectors:\nUpon successful completion of the work packages outlined above, the ADPC may take on up to two additional verticals based on DAO demand and the committee\u2019s capacity. This work would require approval through the DAO\u2019s governance process and would be contingent on the ADPC\u2019s term being extended if necessary.\n_______________________\n## Budget for Phase II:\nThe total budget for this 6-month period is $414,000. This amount includes operational expenses and will be disbursed in six monthly installments. The funding request will (based on prices at the time of posting and subject to change) total 915,658 ARB, calculated based on the average ARB price at $0.5425/ARB. A buffer is included to protect against ARB price depreciation, ensuring that the ADPC can meet its financial obligations. The funds will be OTC\u2019d to USDC. Any unutilized ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury at the end of the term.\n_______________________\n## Additional Information:\nThe proposal also includes the re-election of the current ADPC members (Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal) to continue their roles in Phase II. This is intended to provide continuity and ensure that the progress made in Phase I can be built upon without interruption.\n\nThe committee believes that by extending its tenure, it can continue to deliver significant value to the Arbitrum ecosystem by optimizing procurement processes, securing vital services, and enabling a smoother governance structure for the DAO.

This capital is currently sitting stagnant, and could be much more valuable and functional for the ecosystem within the ATMC, generating yield and increasing the DAO\u2019s ETH holdings\n* An added benefit of activating ETH from the treasury is the potential to support liquidity in venues within the Arbitrum ecosystem to supplement increased activity from DRIP, while not receiving or diluting any of the incentives (the DAO\u2019s allocations would be excluded from ARB rewards).\n* The ATMC has generated just over 43 ETH to date (beginning May 2025) by activating idle ETH from the treasury, with a 30D lookback APY of 2.43% on ETH-denominated strategies at the time of writing.\n  * At current 30-day-average annualized rates (note: proposed treasury deployments will not necessarily be in identical allocations), an additional tranche of 8500 ETH allocated to comparable-yield strategies could make the DAO an extra 204 ETH over the next year, or ~$891k at current prices.\n* The DAO treasury value is still highly concentrated in ARB tokens, and all efforts to diversify and increase the quantity of non-ARB tokens in the treasury that also support broader ecosystem growth should be considered.\n* Although the prospective increase in ETH is very marginal against the treasury concentration of ARB, these initiatives help grow non-ARB assets without requiring spot sales of ARB, continuing a long-term path to prudent diversification.\n* Deploying a portion of this idle capital to the ATMC is aligned with treasury management best practices: principal preservation, yield generation, and ecosystem support.\n\n## Motivation / Rationale\n\nOpportunity Cost and Past Performance\n\nAt present, over 10,000 ETH sits idle in the treasury, generating no yield and contributing minimally to the growth of the ecosystem. Allocating a portion of this to yield-generating strategies is in line with treasury management best practices.\n\nSince May, the ATMC ETH-denominated strategies have generated 43.4 ETH, utilizing AAVE, Fluid, Camelot, and Lido. Performance and a detailed breakdown of the ETH allocations, as well as other treasury strategies, can be seen [here.](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-treasury-management-program)\n\nAssuming a prospective allocation of 8500 ETH and a conservative ETH-denominated yield of ~2.4% (illustrative figure based on the 30-day average annualized yield for existing ATMC strategies), the DAO is foregoing approximately 204 ETH annually, which is $891k at current market prices. Even at the lowest 30-day average annualized yield rate of 2.04% (recorded July 15th), the projected opportunity cost of letting this ETH sit unallocated is 173 ETH, or $756k at current market prices.\n\nFrom a treasury management perspective, maintaining a large passive ETH position without a corresponding yield strategy is suboptimal, especially when there exists a variety of deployments that would be appropriate to allocate it to, including but not limited to native staking, restaking, DEX liquidity provision, and lending market supply.\n\nDeFi Ecosystem Support\n\nThis proposal is in direct strategic alignment with the current DRIP campaign, fulfilling treasury management\u2019s dual mandate of:\n\n1. Generating yield and growing/diversifying the treasury\n2. Supporting growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem, particularly within DeFi\n\nA major goal of the Arbitrum DRIP program is to spur activity within the broader Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem, initially focusing on boosting leveraged looping strategies within DeFi utilizing yield-bearing collateral. Decisions regarding these funds will prioritize supporting these initiatives where possible, deploying productive capital across various venues, though this will not take absolute precedent over existing considerations regarding risk, liquidity, partnership opportunities, sustainable yields, etc.\n\nSome indicative examples of DRIP-aligned treasury strategies would be supplying unstaked ETH to lending markets, or staking ETH with LST/LRT providers, and exploring adding DEX liquidity across native ETH and LST/LRTs pools. With some of these strategies, we can ensure that users who are looking to participate in DRIP have ample liquidity, and we can even make an impact by stabilizing lending market utilization rates, reducing borrowing costs or slippage.\n\nAs with prior deployments, we intend to communicate with prospective partner protocols to negotiate terms beneficial to the DAO or reduced costs on any deployments when possible or appropriate.\n\n## Specifications\n\nEntropy proposes that the new tranche of 8500 ETH be used in a variety of generally lower-risk, ecosystem-supporting protocols, including but not limited to\n\n* Liquid Staking\n* Liquid Restaking\n* Lending Markets\n* Liquidity Provision on DEXes\n\nThe 8500 ETH is not intended to mirror the existing treasury strategy deployments, unless extenuating circumstances indicate these to be undoubtedly the best option to support the ecosystem and generate risk-adjusted returns. The DAO\u2019s wallets will be blacklisted from receiving any possible DRIP incentives.\n\nFor this proposal, we will not be conducting an open RFP process for protocols to apply for funding. Entropy will proactively engage with protocols providing services that align with our strategic goals. To have full confidence in the deployment of this capital, evaluations of various strategies will heavily take into account criteria such as protocol maturity, ecosystem impact, yield sustainability, and economic and smart contract risk.\n\nAs structured in the [ATMC proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-management-atm-council-details/29626), the elected OAT body will maintain full ability to approve or deny granular selection decisions. No allocation can be made unilaterally by Entropy. Funds will be sent to and custodied by the Arbitrum Foundation. Rebalancing needs will be examined as part of our normal treasury management reporting cadence, considering liquidity constraints, yield conditions, or shifts in ecosystem needs.\n\nGiven that the 8500 ETH requested represents a material portion of the non-ARB, unallocated treasury funds, capital preservation and long-term impact remain primary priorities. Future proposals could consider allocating a smaller amount of ETH to newer and novel protocols requiring bootstrapped liquidity support.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Forum Period September 16th - September 25th: Requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions.\n2. Snapshot September 25th - October 2nd\n3. If approved on Snapshot and no additional major comments/objections arise, the proposal will be moved to Tally on October 6th, with voting active from October 9th to ~23rd.\n4.

Dia adds support for relevant Execution Layer (EL) changes from Ethereum\u2019s upcoming [Fusaka upgrade](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7607) (Q4 2025), enabling [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537), a few bug fixes, and a handful of new features, such as a new feature called Native Mint/Burn.\n\nWhile the goal of the proposed ArbOS 50 Dia upgrade is to eventually be available for adoption by any Arbitrum Chain, this proposal only concerns the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains, as these two chains are governed by the ArbitrumDAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be interpreted as Arbitrum\u2019s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\nPlease note that ArbOS Version 50 Dia is a proposed upgrade that builds upon ArbOS 40 Callisto, which has been previously adopted by the ArbitrumDAO - this proposal increments the version number to 50 instead of 4x due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability, as explained [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/arbos-upgrade#step-3-schedule-the-arbos-version-upgrade).\n\n# Changes that will be included in ArbOS 50 Dia\n\n### [EIP-7951](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7951): Precompile for secp256r1 Curve Support\n\nThis EIP implements the same functionality and interface as [RIP-7212](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md), which was activated as part of [ArbOS 31 Bianca](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-31-bianca-activation-of-arbitrum-stylus-rip-7212-support-nova-fee-router-proposal/25904). The main difference here is to add a point-at-infinity check and to update the comparison step in the signature verification algorithm. Developers should expect the same behavior as the EIP being proposed on Ethereum after Fusaka is activated.\n\n### [EIP-7825](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7825): Transaction Gas Limit Cap\n\nThis EIP introduces a gas cap for individual transactions. The goal is to ensure fairer access to block space and improve network stability. For Arbitrum One & Arbitrum Nova we are proposing a 32 million gas limit (L2 execution gas, not including L1 gas) per transaction, which is the same as the current block gas limit. This 32 million gas limit diverges from the EIPs\u2019 proposed limit of 16 million gas per transaction for Ethereum L1. Orbit chains can customize this value according to their chains\u2019 needs.\n\n### [EIP-7642](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7642): eth/69 - history expiry and simpler receipts\n\nThis networking upgrade removes deprecated fields used prior to Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) transition. We are including this EIP as part of GETH upstream. This is a networking change that impacts mainly L1 nodes. As arbitrum nodes do not have a P2P layer, we do not expect this to have any impact on arbitrum node operators.\n\n### [EIP-7939](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7939): Count leading zeros (CLZ) opcode\n\nThis EIP adds a new CLZ (Count Leading Zeros) opcode to efficiently count the number of zero bits at the start of a 256-bit number. This is a fundamental mathematical operation used in many algorithms, especially for mathematical computations, data compression, and cryptographic operations. Currently, implementing this operation in Solidity requires complex and expensive code - this opcode makes it much cheaper and faster.\n\n### [EIP-7823](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7823): Set upper bounds for MODEXP\n\nThis EIP introduces a 8192-bit (1024 byte) limit on each input to the MODEXP cryptographic precompile. MODEXP has been a source of consensus bugs due to unbounded inputs. By setting practical limits that cover real-world use cases (like RSA verification), this reduces the testing surface area and paves the way for future replacement with more efficient EVM code.\n\n### [EIP-7883](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7883): ModExp Gas Cost Increase\n\nThis EIP increases the gas cost of the ModExp cryptographic precompile to address underpriced operations. It raises the minimum cost from 200 to 500 gas and doubles the costs for large inputs over 32 bytes.\n\n### [EIP-7910](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7910): eth_config JSON-RPC Method\n\nThis EIP provides a new RPC method that allows the Arbitrum Nitro node to respond with key configuration variables, offering node operators the ability to gain greater confidence that their Nitro nodes are correctly configured and prepared for upcoming forks. In future Nitro releases, we expect to include additional fields specific to Arbitrum chains. This update is at the RPC level and may be enabled later than the ArbOS 50 Dia upgrade.\n\n### Enable [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537): Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations\n\nAs [disclosed previously](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/disclosure-of-support-for-eip-2537-on-arbitrum-one-and-nova/29720), the precompiled contracts for performing various operations over the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, including BLS signature verification, were added but not properly enabled in [ArbOS 40 Callisto](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos40) as originally expected. ArbOS 50 Dia will now enable EIP-2537.\n\n### A few bug fixes\n\n- ArbOS Didn\u2019t Get Updated For L1 Calldata Price Increase\n\n     - This change standardizes the calculation of gas units for compressed batch calldata across the codebase by replacing hard-coded values with a method call (tokenGasUnits).\n\n- EIP-7702 Precompile Delegation Behavior Divergence\n     \n     - Previously, calls to precompiles could execute an INVALID opcode instead of succeeding with no execution. ArbOS 50 Dia will update code to align with EIP-7702 spec to treat precompile code as empty during delegation.\n\n### A Constraint-Based Pricing Change: STF instrumentation to track multi-gas\n\nWe have instrumented Arbitrum\u2019s State Transition Function (STF) to track gas usage across multiple resource types including computation, storage access, storage growth, and history growth, rather than only a single total based on opcodes. This work lays the foundation for dynamic, constraint-based pricing where gas fees can adjust based on the most constrained resource at the network level. The goal is to create more stable prices, improve responsiveness to spikes, and allow the network to safely increase throughput without overloading node hardware. In this release, none of the constraints are enabled, so there will be no impact on current gas prices. This update simply adds the ability to measure and record per-resource usage, with actual pricing changes coming in a later version once constraints are configured, benchmarked and tested.\n\nTo read more about this feature, go [here](https://blog.arbitrum.io/dynamic-pricing-explainer/).\n\n### Native Token Mint/Burn\n\nNative Token Mint/Burn is a feature that allows Arbitrum chains to use interoperability-enabled token standards (e.g., LayerZero OFTs, xERC20s, native USDC) as native gas tokens on their chains. Currently, Arbitrum chains are designed to \u201clock and mint\u201d native gas tokens on the chain\u2019s canonical bridge. However, doing so means that these \u201clocked and minted\u201d native gas tokens cannot interact with third-party cross-chain adapter contracts. This new feature lets an Arbitrum chain delegate minting and burning of its native gas token to a trusted bridge provider (e.g., LayerZero OFT).\n\nNative Token Mint/Burn is proposed to be included in ArbOS 50 Dia for the benefit of Arbitrum Orbit chains (reducing the need for forks) and to streamline development and testing into a single codebase. There are no plans to enable this feature on Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova, consequently this feature will be explicitly left disabled for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo read more about this feature, go [here](https://arbitrum.notion.site/Enable-Native-Mint-Burn-for-your-chain-s-gas-token-22601a3f59f880be9b99d3d55f982a17).\n\n# Fusaka EIPs that are not proposed to be in ArbOS 50 Dia\nSupport and implementation for the following EIPs are not planned to be part of ArbOS 50 Dia:\n\n- [EIP-7594](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594), [EIP-7918](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7918), and [EIP-7892](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7892), since Arbitrum chains do not have blob data markets (though they do support posting blob data to a non-Arbitrum parent chain)\n\n- [EIP-7917](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7917), since Arbitrum chains do not have a beacon chain and therefore do not have a peer-to-peer layer like Ethereum does\n\n- [EIP-7934](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7934), this EIP is to help propagating blocks between nodes. Arbitrum doesn't do that - it sends messages (which are limited) and each node builds every block by itself\n\n- [EIP-7907](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7907), since this EIP is no longer Scheduled For Inclusion (SFI) for Fusaka, as agreed upon by client teams during [ACDE #216](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/allcoredevs-execution-acde-216-july-17-2025/24770/2) on July 17, 2025. We are currently exploring alternative ways to increase the contract size limit that do not interfere with the ability for Arbitrum chains to support EIP-7907 in the future. Please see this [forum post reply](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-to-direct-the-arbitrum-foundation-to-implement-an-extended-version-of-eip-7907-and-for-the-dao-to-ratify-its-deployment-on-arbitrum-one/29375/3 for more details about this.\n\n- [EIP-7935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7935), since Arbitrum chains already have a default gas target of 28Mgas/s and we have separate, alternative plans for increasing the gas limit through other means, as mentioned [here](https://blog.arbitrum.io/scaling-arbitrum-everywhere/).\n\n# Steps to implement\n\nMore detailed information about the specific implementation and versions will be provided closer to the date of the formal on-chain Tally vote. However, this proposal will roughly follow the steps below:\n\n1. An AIP outlining the proposed upgrade and specification is proposed to the ArbitrumDAO forum for discussion (this post);\n\n2. A temperature check vote is held on Snapshot;\n\n3. Engineering work to scope out and implement the relevant changes for ArbOS 50 Dia into the Nitro node software, relevant rollup contracts, and associated upgrade actions (this work has already begun);\n\n4. A new version of Nitro and nitro-contracts, if necessary, are released that support ArbOS 50 Dia;\n\n5. A security audit of all ArbOS 50 Dia relevant changes is conducted by a third-party (Trail of Bits) and the audit report is published for public consumption;\n\n6. Should the Snapshot vote pass, ArbOS 50 Dia will be deployed to both private devnets & Arbitrum Sepolia for testing;\n\n7. A formal AIP is proposed to Tally for an on-chain vote;\n\n8. If the on-chain vote passes, ArbOS 50 Dia will be activated on Arbitrum One and on Arbitrum Nova following the required waiting periods and phases, as outlined in the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal).\n\n### Note on Fusaka hard fork timelines\n\nSimilar to the [ArbOS 20 Atlas upgrade](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos20) and the [Ethereum Dencun hard fork](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/02/27/dencun-mainnet-announcement) in March 2024, the activation timestamp for ArbOS 50 Dia will be targeted for roughly the same timestamp as when Ethereum Mainnet hard forks. At the time of writing and as of the latest [All Core Devs Consensus (ACDC) Call #218 held on August 14th, 2025](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1652), the tentative timestamp of the Ethereum Mainnet fork for Fusaka is targeted for the first or second week of November 2025.

The selected protocols include Camelot, Aave, Lido, and Fluid. If this vote receives 3% of the votable token supply in favor (or abstain) of deploying assets in accordance to the GMC's choices, the Arbitrum Foundation will begin to mobilize. \n\n# Summary [Updated on March 14, 2025]\nOn December 21 2024, the Arbitrum DAO voted in favour of establishing two committees - the Treasury Management Committee (TMC) and the Growth Management Committee (GMC), who were tasked with spearheading treasury management efforts involving 25M ARB and 7,500 ETH, respectively, within the ArbitrumDAO\u2019s treasury.\n\nThis proposal presents GMC\u2019s preferred allocation choices with accompanying risk assessments performed by LlamaRisk. After assessing all 45 applications, the GMC is proposing to allocate 5,000 ETH to Lido to be staked for wstETH, and deposit this 5,000 wstETH into Aave V3 on Arbitrum to act as liquidity for LST/LRT looping, and lastly, lend 2,500 ETH on Fluid to support ETH based DEX and lending liquidity.\n\n# Objectives\nAs highlighted in the original Treasury Management V1.2 proposal, the purpose of the Growth Management Committee (GMC) was to provide a path for the Arbitrum Foundation to deploy 7,500 ETH from the DAO\u2019s treasury to achieve 2 things:\n\nGenerate low-risk yield on otherwise idle ETH\nSpur ecosystem growth\nMoreover, given this is the DAO\u2019s first tranche of funds, we really wanted to ensure the DAO starts with a really strong and stable foundation, while securing key partnerships from the very beginning. Thus, we focused on selecting extremely high quality partners with low risk strategies that allowed the DAO\u2019s funds to maximize its reach and impact within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# GMC\u2019s Preferred Allocations\nTotal Allocation: 7,500 ETH\n\nNumber of Allocations: 4\n\n# Allocation 1:\n\nProtocol: Lido\n\nAllocation Amount: 5,000 ETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Deposit and stake 5,000 ETH with Lido to receive wstETH\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n3.20% ETH/stETH yield (30D Avg.)\nHighly liquid & composable receipt token that can be extended across other applications (wstETH)\n20% \u201cReward Share\u201d from Lido\u2019s Reward-Share Program, effectively giving the DAO a higher yield on our ETH deposits into Lido\n# Allocation 2:\n\nProtocol: Aave\n\nAllocation Amount: 4,200 stETH (in wstETH) [Previously 5,000 ETH]\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Supply 4,200 stETH (in wstETH) to Aave V3 on Arbitrum to encourage LRT borrowing against wstETH in collaboration with Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n3.20% ETH/stETH yield (30D Avg.) + est. Aave wstETH supply yield of 0.62% + 0.82% in wstETH deposit incentives\nAdditional incentive programs from Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp, to drive wstETH, ezETH, and rsETH deposits to Aave V3 and more generally Arbitrum. This should also hopefully increase supply rates for wstETH on Aave\nAllows the DAO to repurpose funds from Allocation 1 (wstETH) to further improve the DeFi ecosystem while accessing a higher yield\nFurther Details Regarding Incentives:\n\nIn cooperation with Lido, an incentive program to grow wstETH deposits on the Aave Arbitrum instance has been designed.\n\nThe incentive program consists of three 30-day phases, each with increasing targets and budgets to encourage sustained growth in wstETH deposits on Aave. After 90 days this program will be reassessed and may be renewed. For each phase, the reward mechanism operates in two modes:\n\nWhen deposits are below the target: Depositors earn a fixed 0.82% APY.\nWhen deposits exceed the target: The daily reward amount is distributed pro-rata among all depositors.\nThe program features a 15% Month-over-Month growth target with an expanding budget to support continued growth in wstETH deposits on the Arbitrum Aave instance.\n\nPeriod (Days)\tBudget (wstETH)\tFixed APY\tDeposit Target\tDaily Reward\n0-30\t36.23\t0.82%\t53,014.48\t1.191\n31-60\t41.66\t0.82%\t60,956.66\t1.389\n61-90\t47.91\t0.82%\t70,111.66\t1.597\nRenzo\n\nRenzo is to provide 0.30% yield in REZ to users who deposit ezETH distributed every 30 days , provided certain conditions are upheld.\n\nKelp\n\nKelp is to provide x2 KERNEL points to users who deposit rsETH. These rewards will be claimable during Kernel\u2019s TGE. Whilst the point yield is speculative, it does provide an alternative to Renzo\u2019s governance token derived yield.\n\nIncentives\n\nThis strategy benefits directly from the Lido wstETH deposit incentives, and will indirectly benefit from the Renzo and Kelp deposit incentives.\n\nReward Type\tValue\tRewards to who\tBenefits treasury funds?\nwstETH Deposit Rewards\t0.82% APY\twstETH depositors\tDirectly\nKERNEL Points\tx2 Points\trsETH depositors\tIndirectly\nREZ Tokens\t0.3% APY\tezETH despositors\tIndirectly\nExpected Returns\n\nBased upon our modelling of the effects of the upcoming incentive programs and some minor Aave parameter adjustments which are planned, we expect wstETH deposits to generate the following returns:\n\nSource\tYield (APY)\nLido staking rewards\t3.10%\nAave protocol yield\t0.62%\nwstETH deposit incentives\t0.82%\nTotal yield\t4.54%\n# Allocation 3:\n\nProtocol: Fluid\n\nAllocation Amount: 2,500 ETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Lend 2,500 ETH on Fluid\u2019s Arbitrum platform\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n1%-2% native ETH yield\nSupport the growth of Fluid\u2019s highly capital efficient DEX and lending protocol by providing \u2018sticky\u2019 ETH liquidity for users to borrow\nDue to Fluid\u2019s design, every $1 of ETH we lend, the Arbitrum ecosystem can benefit from up to $39 in liquidity\nProvide necessary liquidity to increase caps and onboard more LSTs and LRTs to Fluid\u2019s Arbitrum instance\n# [Added as of March 14, 2025] Allocation 4:\n\nProtocol: Camelot - Updated submission can be found here\n\nAllocation Amount: 800 stETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Deposit 800 stETH (as wstETH) as single sided liquidity into the wstETH/ETH liquidity pool on Camelot V3.\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\nEarn 2.56% APY from wstETH yield, trading fees, & xGRAIL (30D Avg.)\nAllows the DAO to repurpose funds from Allocation 1 (wstETH) to further improve sticky DeFi liquidity\nA risk Assessment (LlamaRisk) finds that risks include liquidity concentration risk and smart contract risk.\n\nNote: The decision to provide single-sided wstETH liquidity came from discussions with and detailed analysis by the Camelot team, as they are aware of the difficulties associated with the DAO and the Arbitrum Foundation actively managing a concentrated LP position. Nonetheless, the strategy still successfully improves wstETH liquidity on Camelot and the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\n# Justification\nThe GMC was impressed by the quality of inbound applications from protocols across many different verticals (full list can be in a subsequent section of this post). While the GMC wanted to venture further down the risk curve in order to increase yield, help bootstrap up and coming protocols, bolster Arbitrum native/aligned protocols, among other desires, it determined that a strong/conservative foundation for the DAO\u2019s treasury strategy made the most sense until the DAO becomes more capable of actively managing positions.\n\nFor example, many proposals included LRT-based strategies. While the GMC did want to encourage the growth of LRTs, we did not think the direct exposure to LRTs was appropriate for the first tranche of fund deployments. Instead, we chose a sector that indirectly benefits LRTs by deepening wstETH liquidity to enable LRT looping strategies. In a different example to help explain the rationale behind our preferred choices, many applications included vote-locked/escrowed tokens as a portion of the yield, but it\u2019s difficult to envision how these reward tokens would be managed in practice. A large number of applicants requested the DAO take on leveraged positions, which would require active management to manage liquidation risk. We also received applications from centralized entities, but felt the allocation would be most beneficial for the Arbitrum ecosystem if given to protocol applications that indirectly benefit a variety of other protocols on Arbitrum.\n\nLido, Aave, and Fluid represent safe applications that achieve conservative yield and strongly support ecosystem growth. Lido has offered a strong concession in its 20% reward share to the DAO, and has proven to be an essential protocol across a number of DeFi ecosystems. Many protocols on Arbitrum would benefit from a larger supply of wstETH on the network, and by partnering with Lido, we are able to achieve this and form a long-term relationship with a protocol that has made critical contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem. Aave falls in this camp as well, it is a well-established and battle-tested player that is easy to form a treasury management strategy around, and it has exemplified product market fit across a wide variety of DeFi ecosystems. In terms of Fluid, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi protocols, with its marketshare continually trending upwards on Ethereum mainnet thanks to its capital efficient design. Fluid is already seeing strong growth on Arbitrum One, has committed to incentivizing its Arbitrum One deployment, and the GMC believes that this growth can be fueled forward by including them in the DAO\u2019s treasury management program. Fluid\u2019s highest-in-class LTVs will result in maximum ecosystem value add for those users wishing to take advantage of these unique opportunities too.\n\nWe want to remind all applicants that this is hopefully the first round of many future allocations. The desire is to continually reinvest ETH and stablecoin revenue into the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem to increase DAO sustainability as well as supporting Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem of builders. If you were not selected this round, you will be considered in future allocations assuming the DAO supports it.\n\n# Risk Assessment (Llama Risk)\nLlamaRisk has reviewed these different strategies and finds the risk inherent to each is satisfactorily mitigated to warrant the allocation. In summary, LlamaRisk have identified the following key asset risks and strategy risks:\n\nIncremental wstETH asset risks include:\n\nLiquidity for the asset is low on Arbitrum, meaning the ETH allocation will have to be staked on mainnet then bridged over using Arbitrum\u2019s canonical bridge.\nIncremental Aave wstETH strategy risks include:\n\nArbitrum DAO may not be able to withdraw its entire position at all times due to volatility reducing market liquidity. This risk is managed by Aave\u2019s interest rate model, with successful effects demonstrated with the level of withdrawal liquidity of Aave V3\u2019s Arbitrum wstETH market being over 40,000 on February 4th.\nThe yield may be lower than anticipated as liquid restaking yield is lower than was expected 6 months ago, meaning limited profit for traders leveraged longing liquid restaking tokens and shorting liquid staking tokens. This is the primary use case for those looking to short wstETH, which is demonstrated by low deposit rates for wstETH on this market.\nFluid strategy risks include:\n\nFluid DAO change management processes (e.g. LTV modifications) are not clearly structured and outlined. This could lead to changes to market critical settings going into effect without all participants knowing, which may have unintended consequences.\nA high degree of trust is placed in the core team, with access controls resting in their hands over important functions such as freezing the protocol, users and market modifications. A 7/13 multisig controls these functions, which is owned by the core team. Given that many of these signers are based in India, some degree of operational risk is introduced from frequently arbitrary regulatory rulings in this jurisdiction potentially preventing their continued compliance with the protocol\u2019s best interest. Uncertainty remains, introducing risk.\nAs with Aave, pool liquidity risk may prevent the DAO\u2019s entire position being withdrawn in a single transaction during periods of high volatility. Also as with Aave, Fluid competently restores market liquidity quickly through its interest rate model.\nFull risk analyses, with guiding processes, are available:\n\nwstETH asset + Aave Strategy Risk Analysis\nETH asset + Fluid Risk Analysis\n# Next Steps\nIf approved by the DAO, which per the original proposal that passed on Tally requires a Snapshot vote with a simple majority of votes signaling For/Abstain with the quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply at the time of the proposal going live, the Arbitrum Foundation can begin deploying the 7,500 ETH in accordance with the processes defined in the original applications. This proposal will move to Snapshot on Thursday, March 20, 2025.\n\nIf the DAO rejects the choice of the GMC, it will take into account the feedback from the community and alter its choices and proceed to another forum post/Snapshot vote over the coming weeks.\n\n# Full list of applications\nThe entire list of submitted applications can be found here.

This payment will be distributed over 12 months and sent regularly along with the payments to the delegates.\n\n**Karma Details:**\n\n- $5800/month * 12 = $69,600 for continuing to build and enhance the dashboard.\n\n**SEEDGov Details:**\n\n- 2 Program Administrators (1 Part-Time - 1 Full-time): $117,000 over 12 months.\n\n- 1 Data Analyst (Part-Time): $35,000 over 12 months.\n\n**Total:** $152,000 ($12,667 per month)\n\n## Budget Summary\n\n- USD 4,200,000 in Incentives. Delegates' compensation is capped at 16,500 ARB per delegate per month (Tier 1), which means the maximum spending on incentives would be 9,900,000 ARB per year (16,500 ARB x 50 delegates x 12 months). The ARB cap already includes a 30% buffer, and it will be recalculated before Tally.\n\n- USD 69,600 +30% ARB buffer for Dashboard maintenance and upgrade\n\n- USD 152,000 +30% ARB buffer for Operational Costs/Program Administration.\n\n**Total:** USD 4,421,600\n\n**Note:** *USD costs are fixed, meaning that if the price of ARB increases, the USD costs will remain the same. At the end of the program, any remaining ARB tokens from the program will be returned to the treasury.*\n\n**Note 2:** *Any remaining funds from the experimental incentive program multisig will sent back to the treasury.*\n\n**Note 3:** *Final amounts in ARB will be recalculated on the basis of the ARB price at the time of submitting the proposal for voting in Tally.*\n\n**Note 4:** *The funds will be sent to the recently approved* MSS.\n\n**Note 5:** *If the program exceeds 65 participants (which is the number that we believe we could cover with the budget requested) we will reopen discussions in the forum on the budget, also considering the possibility of increasing the number of delegates incentivized.*\n\n## Option 2 - Introducing Delegates Incentive Program v1.5: a New Evaluation System for Delegates\u2019 Feedback\n\nInstead of counting comments on proposals that reach Snapshot, we propose implementing a monthly analysis of the feedback provided by delegates, regardless of whether the proposal/discussion has reached Snapshot.\n\nIn this way, the Program Administrator would be responsible for creating a rubric that evaluates the value and timeliness of the feedback provided by delegates. \n\n***Note: in this option the weight of Communicating Rationale (CR) is 10% and for Delegates\u2019 Feedback is 30% instead of 15% and 25% like in the proposed V1.1.***\n\n### Evaluation Approach\n\nThis rubric assesses the overall feedback provided by the delegate throughout the month (from day 1 at 00:00 UTC to the last day of the month at 23:59:59 UTC), based on a summary of their participation in various proposals and discussions.\n\n* Key point: Feedback or opinions that violate community rules will not be considered.\n\n### Rubric Specifications\n\nThe parameter \u201cProposal Feedback\u201d should be renamed to \"Delegate\u2019s Feedback\u201d in this case since we\u2019re analyzing the overall feedback provided by the delegate (not just proposals on snapshot) and will maintain a maximum weight of 30%, the score will be awarded based on the following rubric:\n\n![|602x471](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfMR0vvihktjB6t-iKq9OgMUxMwgEhD4SqI7hWb0rlKUkkCSHMfvlWEgHL4gvFTzpoJ07_FNqVRkXzPKw9PkbFXGXLrv66FqH1PIImG-H2nShlp7EzTWd9V9BgU_gq9-lUVKgp9ryuSLgedYx1-djIwkng?key=z0llyoBlBsbRIxKCLzkjNQ)\n\n### Monthly Evaluation Process\n\n**1. Data Collection**\n\n**2. Overall Evaluation**\n\n**3. Score Assignment**\n\n**4. Monthly Report**\n\n### Scoring Methodology\n\nEach rubric criterion has levels with an assigned score, from 1 to 4, depending on the level achieved.\n\nThe initial score is obtained by adding the first five criteria, while the final score results from applying the \u201cPresence in Discussions\u201d multiplier to the initial score. The maximum Initial Score is 20 points and 30 points for the Final Score.\n\nAlso if v1.5 is chosen, this scoring system will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.\n\n### Administrative Budget v1.5 (option 2)\n\nThis option changes the responsibilities and budget of the Program Administrators. It requires more human resources to expand the Delegate\u2019s Feedback analysis and additional time and resources to develop and train the AI for automation.\n\nNew budget details:\n\n* On the Program Administrator side: $16,000/month - $192,000/year (2 program administrators, both full-time instead of 1 part-time and 1 full-time + 1 data analyst part-time)\n\n* On the Dashboard and Tools provider side: $7250/month - $87,000/year\n\n* Total administrative budget: $279,000/year (6,6% of the delegates\u2019 incentives budget)\n\n## Management and development of the Delegate Incentives Program: Responsibilities and Deliverables\n\nThe SEEDGov team and Karma will continue to collaborate to maintain and manage this new version of the DIP.\n\n### Program Dashboard Management (Karma)\n\nSee the responsibilities breakdown [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-program-dashboard-management-karma-35).\n\n### Program Manager (SEEDGov)\n\nSee the responsibilities breakdown [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-program-manager-seedgov-36).\n\n## KPIs\n\nSee the KPIs breakdown [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-program-manager-seedgov-36).", "match_confidence": 0.8197, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "d1b1a614-96cd-44dc-bbc1-c4955574ff06", "proposal_id": "232201b8-fc63-4d1b-8d87-ca3eb3f2f1dd", "snapshot_id": "0x98a2b1eebda641b31d7d22a60708840ec7899157e00a4028f2e9f3030ddaf7a8", "title": "AIP: BoLD - permissionless validation for Arbitrum", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x98a2b1eebda641b31d7d22a60708840ec7899157e00a4028f2e9f3030ddaf7a8", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-06-06 18:16:34", "voting_end": "2024-06-13 18:16:34", "options": {"scores": [166971939.93604475, 43080.45874771479, 96170.7519266452], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-06-13 18:16:34", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.166", "body": "This Snapshot vote aims to solicit a temperature check from the ArbitrumDAO on their stance for bringing the BoLD upgrade to Arbitrum One and Nova. BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains and enhances their security by mitigating the risk of delay attacks.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the original [BoLD AIP Forum Post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) where you will find public audit reports, the BoLD whitepaper (that contain the formal specification and safety proofs), as well as further explanations of how BoLD works (including an overview of BoLD\u2019s economics, spam prevention, rewards, reimbursements and penalties) and its proposed design for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis Constitutional AIP proposes upgrading Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova\u2019s Rollup Contracts to use Arbitrum BoLD and to support a new challenger manager contract on Ethereum. Arbitrum BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that\u2019s designed to replace the existing and currently deployed Arbitrum protocol. If the upgrade is approved, then validators on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova can use the Nitro software to participate in BoLD. BoLD delivers two critical improvements:\n- Unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains,\n- Enhances the security of Arbitrum chains by mitigating the risk of [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a).\n\nBoLD accomplishes this feat by ensuring that any single honest party can always successfully defend against malicious claims to an Arbitrum chain\u2019s state. BoLD represents the next step on the journey to having the Arbitrum technology stack being recognized as a [Stage 2 Ethereum rollup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571). The implementation of BoLD will be thoroughly tested to ensure both its effectiveness and safety. The testing plan includes:\n- A comprehensive [audit by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf),\n- Deployment of the protocol to public testnets for at least 8 weeks,\n- A public [audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold),\n- [Publication of mathematical safety proofs and formal specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO should consider approving this AIP as BoLD delivers critical security and decentralization improvements for Arbitrum One and Nova that benefit all Arbitrum users, Arbitrum node operators, dApps on Arbitrum, and Arbitrum bridges. These benefits can be extended to any Orbit chain that wishes to adopt BoLD.\n\nMore specifically, this new dispute resolution protocol brings the following benefits to Arbitrum chains:\n- Permissionless validation\n- Fixed delay time for assertion confirmation\n- Security Council Safety-First Approach\n\nMore details on these benefits can be found in the [Motivation section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#motivation-2).\n\n## Rationale\n\nEnabling permissionless validation has been a long-term goal of Arbitrum on the [progressive journey towards decentralization](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization).\n\nBoLD mitigates the risk of delay attacks on Optimistic Rollups by ensuring challenges can be resolved within a fixed time period as long as there is an honest party involved. This particular change unlocks permissionless validation, enabling any well-resourced honest party or parties to defend and protect Arbitrum from malicious actors.\n\nMore details on the community values that this proposal supports, can be found in the [Rationale section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#rationale-3).\n\n## Implementation, Formal Specification, and Safety Proofs\n\nThe following link, [BoLD Implementation Deep Dive](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf), explains how BoLD is implemented and how it works at a high level. To read about the formal specifications and mathematical safety proofs for the protocol, check out the [official BoLD whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Economics of Disputes, including the cost to participate, rewards, and penalties\n\nThe economics behind BoLD are carefully researched and designed to optimize for the security of the protocol while keeping costs reasonable for honest parties. More details on this topic can be found in the [Economics section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#overview-of-bolds-economics-and-spam-prevention-5) and this short paper on the [Economics of Disputes in BoLD](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf). \n\n## Technical Risks\n\nSome of the technical risks of the BoLD upgrade include:\n- Issues preventing liveness of challenges due to smart contract bugs in the new contracts. For instance, no honest validator able to make a move when it should be able to;\n- Safety issues where a malicious party is able to game the system and win due to logic errors in smart contracts;\n- Logic bugs in the assertion smart contracts that could affect assertion confirmation and posting, which could delay withdrawals until it is fixed; and\n- Bugs in bonding logic in the smart contracts that could lead to loss of funds due to logic errors in the Arbitrum Rollup and challenge manager smart contracts.\n\nRisks that remain the same between the current Arbitrum Rollup protocol and BoLD:\n- Bugs in the one step proof logic: BoLD does not change how one step proofs work for Arbitrum chains.\n\n## Timeline and steps to implement BoLD for Arbitrum One and Nova\n\nBelow is a list of initiatives to ensure the new BoLD dispute resolution protocol is ready to be reviewed and voted on by the ArbitrumDAO for adoption in Arbitrum One and Nova. Feedback from the community and any findings from testing will be collected and used to inform decisions and evolve BoLD along the way.\n\n1. Deployment of a public testnet with BoLD validators for a minimum of 4 weeks\n  a. Check out this guide on [how to deploy a BoLD validator on the testnet](https://github.com/offchainlabs/bold-validator-starter-kit) to begin testing out permissionless validation using Arbitrum technology!\n2.

This formal temperature check proposal to activate BoLD on Arbitrum\u2019s Sepolia for a minimum of 4 weeks, be made via a Snapshot vote.\n6. Kick-start a [public audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold).\n7. Finalize pre-mainnet requirements, including:\n  a. Publication of BoLD migration documentation for existing validators;\n  b. Deployment of a monitoring stack to view on-going challenges on an Arbitrum chain; and\n  c. Publication of a formal procedure for The Arbitrum Foundation to handle L1 gas costs reimbursements for honest parties.\n8. Formal AIP gets submitted to Tally.\n9. Should the formal on-chain proposal pass, BoLD will activate on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost for this proposal to the ArbitrumDAO as Offchain Labs, Inc. will incur all engineering and audit costs to complete the implementation of BoLD and get this new dispute resolution protocol into a mainnet-ready state. Currently, future development work for BoLD is expected to also be undertaken by Offchain Labs, Inc.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe confirmation timing on any withdrawal that is in-flight when the proposed BoLD upgrade is activated will be delayed until the first BoLD assertion is confirmed. This means that for any Arbitrum chain that upgrades to use BoLD, including Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, all pending withdrawals to L1 Ethereum that were initiated before the upgrade will be delayed by 1 challenge period, plus the time between the withdrawal was initiated and the time that the BoLD upgrade takes place. This is because the upgrade effectively \u201cresets\u201d the challenge period for that are not yet finalized.\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor additional topics & questions, please visit the BoLD specific FAQ document [here](https://www.notion.so/arbitrumfoundation/Arbitrum-BoLD-FAQ-93210f430a6a470792496be040ac9990).", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "d2e7cdab-dd6a-4319-8638-55226564d944", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xfc76965b400c55344ca9aa3134c17492b0c4585671965626fd42a19a76beeaca", "title": "Premia STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xfc76965b400c55344ca9aa3134c17492b0c4585671965626fd42a19a76beeaca", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [160791208.61687335, 7323061.766596837, 631426.994355248], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.584", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

The main objection is the size \u2013 around half a million dollars in ARB. We would prefer to see data on cost of acquiring new users or past campaigns that significantly increased the interaction of existing users with the chain. We recommend this applicant revise and resubmit in a future grants cycle with a smaller request that can be comfortably allocated to more experimental grant plans.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nOnchain gaming has huge potential but has yet to find a field-validated PMF which demonstrates that blockchain can mesh neatly with the business cycle of the gaming industry. Perhaps I\u2019m being too skeptical about the prospects of onchain gaming, but it would be to Arbitrum\u2019s benefit if they succeed. We would be supporting this proposal for several reasons. Firstly, the team behind Knights of the Ether has a strong track record of experience in game development, with notable achievements in both web2 and web3 gaming spaces. Their past successes in engaging and retaining users demonstrate their capability to execute and deliver results.\nSecondly, the proposed incentives program is well-structured and strategically designed to drive user acquisition, retention, and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem. By leveraging Battle Passes, Loot Boxes, Leaderboard Events, and targeted community onboarding, Knights of the Ether aims to attract a significant number of new users to Arbitrum while incentivizing existing users to stay engaged.\nFurthermore, the clear roadmap and milestones outlined in the proposal provide a tangible framework for measuring the success of the grant. By focusing on key performance indicators such as MAU, WAU, DAU, marketplace volume, and on-chain transactions, the team aims to demonstrate tangible growth and impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\n\nKnights of the Ether scored decent across the rubric. While their request is fairly large, we like the Battle Pass incentive design enabling both a free and paid component to hopefully increase retention. They have also shown an ability to bring in new users to the Arbitrum ecosystem. While we would\u2019ve appreciated more specific details for how ARB would\u2019ve been distributed through the Loot Boxes & Battle Pass, we will be supporting this grant due to the long-standing commitment to Arbitrum, strength in being an onboarding agent for Arbitrum gaming, and the second order effects that come from incentivizing their gameplay rollout. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nThis application presented solid milestones, KPIs, goals, and a decent execution plan. However, we found the application missed the key calculations and justifications of their requested grant size. We would\u2019ve liked to have seen customer acquisition calculations and a breakdown of why certain buckets were being allocated X amount of ARB and why. Furthermore, there was very little data provided, of which most was given an in excel sheet which was hard to verify onchain. Their adoption seems to be moderate given the age of the game, but using their MAGIC marketplace volume as a proxy of activity their requested grant size is ~2x larger. Unfortunately, we cannot justify the request grant size but would encourage them to resubmit under a smaller grant size.\n\n*Karel Feedback) - Conflict of interest*", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "d453d1e3-a3a1-4366-8bec-2054968d19c4", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xfd152fdc68cb8ba017105c5b577e955f99228927ef8ce9f6aafa7e2cf36aaa46", "title": "Thales Protocol STIP Addendum", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xfd152fdc68cb8ba017105c5b577e955f99228927ef8ce9f6aafa7e2cf36aaa46", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-05-20 20:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "options": {"scores": [107626984.66722958, 17473468.797817454, 26335722.32117148], "choices": ["Approve funding", "Reject funding", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-05-27 20:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.258", "body": "## Background\n\n**Link to initial STIP application:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thales-final-stip-round-1\n\n**Link to Addendum:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thales-protocol-stip-addendum/23424 \n\n**ARB Requested:**\n200,000 ARB\n\n## Reasoning\n\n**Who proposed this challenge:** \nCattin - Seed Latam\n\n**Why this request needs a closer look:** \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thales-protocol-stip-addendum/23424/3", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "d5abea92-909f-44a5-9080-42d9c65d6de3", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xd67d17db3bd230b163ce1f791d8712812446bced14ef2de875fd01ab3e2be3d6", "title": "Approval of STEP 2 Committee's Preferred Allocations", "author_name": "0xb4c064f466931B8d0F637654c916E3F203c46f13", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd67d17db3bd230b163ce1f791d8712812446bced14ef2de875fd01ab3e2be3d6", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-05-01 13:00:00", "voting_end": "2025-05-08 13:00:00", "options": {"scores": [164019855.89911282, 11229.761640203753, 20589911.453903425], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-05-08 13:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.196", "body": "Following the completion of the allocations made in STEP 1, in February 2025 the Arbitrum DAO passed a proposal for the diversification of an additional 35 million ARB into stable, liquid, and yield bearing assets with the [STEP 2 proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/13323456481927947871314500108227684550647495448005726995657704713229313956489?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4).\n\nWe thank all applicants for their submissions and thoughtful participation in the process.

It expands on existing discussions/designs of \u201cDAO Owned Liquidations\u201d for CDP protocols. Liquidations are always prevented by automatically pulling more collateral from the DAO treasury, increasing the collateral ratio of the loan.\n\n### Pilot Phase\n\nThis pilot is designed to give the DAO sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding borrowing stablecoins against assets in the treasury, and the confidence to use our proposed solution safely.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum community is seeking ways to more efficiently and effectively use the capital in the treasury. The strategies for grant programs, Mergers and Acquisitions, long term investments, and treasury sustainability seek sustainable solutions that minimize required sell pressure on the ARB token.\n\nThe treasury currently has about $3.8B USD worth of ARB tokens. Long term diversification of this is key, but the community also needs access to capital now for grants, treasury management, M&A, and more. Developing an alternative strategy for accessing stablecoins gives Arbitrum DAO more options and power.\n\n# Key Terms\n\nCDP - Collateralized Debt Position. A type of financial primitive used by protocol like Maker, Open Dollar, Reflexer, etc.. Collateral backs stablecoins with required loan to value ratios.\n\nLiquidation - an event which happens when the value of collateral backing a loan is less than the value of the loan, or below a required threshold. This forces the collateral to be sold in order to pay back the debt.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe DAO should have the option to borrow stablecoins against its ARB and other future assets. However, using traditionally structured lending protocols creates too much risk of liquidation. Our proposed solution is a Treasury Backed Vault that severely limits the liquidation risks and lets the community achieve its goals with open access to its capital.\n\nLiquidations are mitigated by a \u201csavior module\u201d connected to a CDP position. The savior module adds an additional step between a vault being marked for liquidation and becoming liquidated. The module automatically pulls more ARB tokens directly from the DAO treasury (or elsewhere), adds them to the collateral of the position until it is raised above the liquidation threshold, and completely prevents liquidations from occurring. Any time liquidation on the DAO\u2019s position is called, the savior activates first. The module contract would be given an allowance of ARB tokens by the Treasury to spend, allowing the Arbitrum DAO to completely control and at any time update the bounds of how many tokens can be pulled from the treasury.\n\nExample usage of Treasury Backed Vaults:\n\n1. Arbitrum DAO deposits 1,000,000 ARB, worth $1,500,000 in a CDP protocol like Open Dollar or others where Treasury Backed Vaults are enabled.\n2. Arbitrum DAO gives a TBV savior module permission to spend an additional 1,000,000 ARB, which remains in the DAO treasury. The DAO sets parameters with the savior.\n3. Arbitrum DAO borrows 1,000,000 stablecoins worth $1,000,000\n4. Due to market conditions, the price of ARB drops 33% suddenly, and the position is under the required collateralization ratio. It is now up for liquidation.\n5. Anyone calls the public function to liquidate the position. The vault is marked for liquidation.\n6. Before liquidation occurs, the savior module is automatically called. It has been set with specific parameters by the DAO to pull an additional 1,000,000 ARB from the treasury and deposit it in the vault.\n7. The position now has 2,000,000 ARB deposited in it, and is safely over the collateralization requirements. No liquidation happens and no additional votes were required to manage the position safely.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe implementation is essentially split into 4 phases\n\n1. Research and Development\n\nA team of 3 solidity developers design, build, and document Treasury Backed Vaults with support for Arbitrum DAO specifically in mind.\n\n2. Risk Analysis\n\nA team of 2 financial analysts complete a report on suggested parameters and the greater ecosystem impact of different borrowing scenarios for Arbitrum DAO. This will come with many helpful recommendations that future delegates can lean on to make proposals to use the vaults how they choose.\n\n3. Audit\n\nA public audit contest will be conducted and managed by our team to review the security of the smart contracts of the TBV. This is important to complete at this stage because we want the DAO to be able to feel confident in the readiness of the system. A formal security report will be published and summarized in a post to the DAO. Audit reward recipients will be required to complete compliance and KYC before receiving funds.\n\n4. Reporting\n\nAt the end of the pilot a report will be made to the DAO that includes results of the security audit, documentation on using TBVs, and results of the risk analysis. The report will include recommendations like how much ARB should be allowed to be pulled by a TBV to limit risk, how many stablecoins could safely be borrowed at a time if the DAO should choose to use the TBVs, how much sell pressure on ARB could be avoided in different scenarios, suggested collateralization settings, and other parameters for real usage.\n\n# Timeline\n\nOverall time to project completion: ~2.5 months\n\nResearch and Development, done asynchronous with risk analysis reporting: 1.5 months\n\nSecurity audit and reporting: 2 weeks\n\nComplete report for the DAO and documentation on usage: 2 weeks\n\n# Team\n\nResearch and development will be completed by a designated team made up on contributors to Open Dollar and led specifically by [CupOjoseph](https://github.com/cupojoseph) & [Pi0neerpat](https://github.com/pi0neerpat). Open Dollar is the largest Arbitrum native stablecoin protocol by TVL. We will also oversee the third party audit of the code that is developed, and personally present the risk analysis (including recommendations) to the DAO at the end of the pilot.\n\n# Overall Cost -\nTotal cost: **250,000 ARB**\n\n### Breakdown\nResearch and Development: 125,000 ARB\n\nIndependent Security Audit: 50,000 ARB\n\nRisk Analysis Report: 50,000 ARB\n\nAdministrative: 25,000 ARB\n\nRemaining or unspent funds will be returned to the DAO treasury promptly.\n\nThank you!! Please support our proposal, we think this could be a huge unlock for the DAO and a powerful tool to add to the community\u2019s toolbox.

The full balance of ETH\u2013currently 1,885 ETH\u2013will be transferred to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One using established smart contract infrastructure.\n\nThere will be an upcoming AIP which combines both the Timeboost AIP and the Nova Fee Sweep action AIP into a single proposal for an on-chain vote on Tally. If the on-chain vote on Tally passes successfully, Timeboost will be enabled on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova and the Nova Fee Sweep action will be executed. This temperature check serves as a way for the DAO to explicitly approve for the fees from the historical [L1TimelockAlias](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) to the [ChildToParentRouter](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code).\n\n## Motivation\nHistorically, Nova transaction fees accumulated to the [L1TimelockAlias](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) address, which required a lengthy constitutional proposal process for the ArbitrumDAO to access or spend. The successful passing of the [Nova Fee Router proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) redirected these fees to a system of \"fee routers\" that automatically transfers funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury, reducing quorum requirements, reducing delays, and simplifying accounting by consolidating funds directly in the treasury. As of 28 August 2024, Nova transaction fees began accumulating to a series of RewardDistributor contracts as outlined in the Nova Fee Router proposal, streamlining the revenue collection process for the DAO.\n\nHowever, transaction fees that accumulated to the L1TimelockAlias *before* the Nova Fee Router change went into effect remain in the L1TimelockAlias, totalling 1,885.79 ETH. This proposal intends to sweep these historical Nova transaction fees from the legacy L1TimelockAlias address into the new fee collection system. This will be a one-time task because funds collected after 28 August 2024 have been, and will continue to be, automatically forwarded through the new fee collection system to the ArbitrumDAO treasury.\n\n## Key Terms\n[L1TimelockAlias](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a): address that historically accumulated Nova transaction fees but was replaced by RewardDistributor contracts as a part of the [Nova Fee Router Proposal](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65) to upgrade the fee collection infrastructure; historical fees held by this address are the subject of this proposal. \n\n[ChildToParentRouter](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code): smart contract that, when called, creates an L2-to-L1 message which sends the contract\u2019s full ETH balance; once the message is executed, the ETH is transferred to a ParentToChildRouter smart contract on L1\n\n[ParentToChildRouter](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40cd7d713d7ae463f95ce5d342ea6e7f5cf7c999#code): smart contract that, when called, creates a retryable ticket which transfers the contract\u2019s full ETH balance from L1 to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One\n\nThe full script for executing the Nova Fee Sweep can be found here: [Standalone Nova Fee Sweep Proposal #303](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/303)\n\n## Steps to Implement\nThe script will be included alongside the onchain AIP which proposes for the adoption of Timeboost on Tally. Since both changes are bundled into one onchain AIP, this temperature check serves as a way for the DAO to explicitly approve for the fees from the historical [L1TimelockAlias](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) to the [ChildToParentRouter](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code).\n\nOnce transaction fees are received by the ChildToParentRouter, the automated fee collection process will be activated, forwarding fees to the [ParentToChildRouter](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40cd7d713d7ae463f95ce5d342ea6e7f5cf7c999#code) on L1 and eventually to the [DAO Treasury](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58) on Arbitrum One; complete implementation details for this automated fee routing can be found in the [preceding Tally proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616). Please note that Reward Distributor contracts are irrelevant for this particular action as historical fees from the L1TimelockAlias will be transferred directly to the ChildToParentRouter.\n\n## Resources and Timelines:\n[Timeboost + Nova Fee Sweep AIP forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-timeboost-nova-fee-sweep/28247) \nNova Fee Sweep Snapshot: 30 Jan - 6 Feb\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will communicate a tentative date for the creation of the onchain AIP in the near future.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "d72eca89-ae7e-4620-a951-011a3fd022bc", "proposal_id": "558ba170-42ee-46ea-88f6-e0a225e8bac7", "snapshot_id": "0xb1a39a0b7543e03cbb7aca0213448f4fbed4cbf1157fcb1b2458540fb452bc73", "title": "Revert the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) to Version 1.5", "author_name": "0xE594469fDe6AE29943a64f81d95c20F5F8eB2e04", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb1a39a0b7543e03cbb7aca0213448f4fbed4cbf1157fcb1b2458540fb452bc73", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-09-04 22:11:00", "voting_end": "2025-09-11 22:11:00", "options": {"scores": [733044.3132010243, 12231641.28753599, 113001468.4064742, 38055295.17865142], "choices": ["Sunset the DIP", "Revert the DIP to v1.5", "Keep the current version", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-09-11 22:11:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:58.812", "body": "## Proposal: Roll back the changes introduced in the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) v1.6 and v 1.7\n\n![](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f1d930b2e5ce0af8061c973ad6cefe97557bda0b.jpeg)\n\n**A Call for a Fairer, More Effective, and Accountable Arbitrum DAO**\n\n> **Note: This proposal has been revised based on community feedback. The goal is no longer to sunset the DIP, but to restore the fair and effective framework of v1.5.**\n\n### TL;DR\n\nThis proposal calls for rolling back the detrimental changes introduced in the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) v1.6 and v1.7. We advocate for a return to the v1.5 framework, which was previously approved by an\u00a0[on-chain vote](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/779895167029508946638584765496434407327098393519089113101189960001594458109%3FgovId%3Deip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4)\u00a0and established clear, objective KPIs for delegate performance.\n\n**Last update: 04/09/2025**\n\n```\nAfter in-depth analysis and considering community feedback, it's clear there is strong sentiment to continue the DIP. However, the program requires significant changes. \nThe drop in quality and participation can be traced directly to the unsanctioned and poorly conceived changes introduced by @SEEDGov since version 1.6.\n```\n\n> **The proposal was edited to make the DIP more inclusive rather than sunsetting it.**\n\n### The Core Issue\n\nThe Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) was created to encourage active and thoughtful governance participation. However, recent versions have distorted its purpose. Instead of fostering a healthy ecosystem, the changes introduced in v1.6 and v1.7 have made the program\u00a0**unfair, unstable, and subjective.**\n\nThe program\u2019s managers (PMs) at\u00a0[@SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov)\u00a0have consistently ignored community feedback,\u00a0[applied rules retroactively](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Delegate-Incentive-Program-DIP-v1-6-Manual-for-Delegates-1a03b4b4c93280a488ffd405f101a7ef), and created a system that penalises smaller delegates while failing to hold large, inactive ones accountable. Their\u00a0[proposed \u201cfix\u201d (v1.7)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-updates-to-the-dip-the-complete-1-7-version/29635)\u00a0only exacerbates these problems by raising the entry barrier tenfold, cutting delegate compensation by 40%, and requesting a 25% raise for themselves.\n\nThe current version of the program is broken, its management has lost the community\u2019s trust, and it is doing more harm than good. It\u2019s time to restore the program that worked.\n\n**This proposal calls for a complete rollback of the DIP to the v1.5 framework.**\n\n### The Problem: A System of Patronage, Not Performance\n\nThe DIP is no longer a fair system of rewards. It has become a system of patronage, where payments depend on the personal, opaque judgment of the Program Managers, not on clear, objective work.\n\n#### 1. The Rules Are Subjective and Unfair\n\nThe program has shifted from a predictable system to a \u201cblack box\u201d where the PMs decide what has \u201cquality\u201d and \u201cimpact.\u201d\n\n* **Guessing Games:**\u00a0Previously, delegates got points for explaining their vote (CR). Now, that clear rule is gone. Your explanation only gets points if the PM decides it was \u201cimpactful.\u201d When delegate\u00a0**Paulo Fonseca**\u00a0pointed out that this was a \u201cconceptually dangerous\u201d metric that could reward bad behaviour, the PMs offered no clear definition, admitting it could only be judged \u201cin hindsight.\u201d This forces delegates to guess what the PMs want, which is not a healthy way to run a DAO.\n* **A \u201cCaste System\u201d for Delegates:**\u00a0The program introduced a \u201cVP Multiplier\u201d that\u00a0**punishes smaller delegates**\u00a0. If you have less than 4 million ARB, your score is automatically cut by up to 20%.\u00a0[@paulofonseca](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/paulofonseca)\u00a0correctly called this a\u00a0**\u201csort of caste system,\u201d**\u00a0and other delegates labelled it a\u00a0**\u201c**[**penalty**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dip-v1-5-delegate-incentive-program-questions-and-feedback/27798/21)**\u201d**\u00a0that makes it nearly impossible for new, hardworking delegates to get fairly compensated.\n\n#### 2. A Pattern of Mismanagement and Unprofessionalism\n\nThe program\u2019s management has been marred by constant failures, making it impossible for anyone to rely on.\n\n* **Constant, Retroactive Rule Changes:**\u00a0The rules change almost every month. Worse, the PMs have applied major changes\u00a0**retroactively**, in the middle of the month. As one delegate put it, it\u2019s like \u201cchanging the rules of the game, literally in the middle of the game.\u201d\n* **Late Results and Ignored Feedback:**\u00a0The monthly results are almost always late, and payments have taken as long as\u00a0**two weeks**\u00a0to be signed. When Paulo Fonseca repeatedly asked for proactive communication about these delays, he was met with dismissiveness. This lack of professionalism shows a fundamental disrespect for the delegates\u2019 time and financial stability.\n* **Overstepping Authority:**\u00a0The PMs have suspended delegates for things they said on Twitter. This is a serious overreach of their power. As multiple delegates argued, their job is to manage the incentive program based on forum activity, not to police social media.\n\n### The Evidence: The Damage Is Real and Measurable.\n\nThese aren\u2019t just opinions. The negative impact of the DIP is clear from the data and the words of the delegates themselves.\n\n#### The Numbers Don\u2019t Lie\n\nThe moment the unfair v1.6 rules were introduced, the number of delegates getting paid fell off a cliff.\n\n| **Month**         | **DIP Version**     | **# of Paid Delegates** | **Total Payout (USD)** |\n| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| December 2024     | 1.5                 | **49**                   | $262,228               |\n| January 2025      | 1.51a               | 32                       | $205,534               |\n| **February 2025** | **1.6 (New Rules)** | **21**                   | **$90,244**            |\n| March 2025        | 1.6                 | 25                       | ~$100,000              |\n\n_Source: Figures discussed in delegate chat logs and forum posts._\n\n![](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/50920a6459f0d832afc00e98c11dab58337c4561_2_517x291.jpeg)\n\nThe number of compensated delegates was\u00a0**cut by more than half**\u00a0as soon as the new rules took effect. One delegate calculated that\u00a0**10 out of the 11 delegates**\u00a0who were disqualified in February were \u201csmall delegates\u201d hurt by the VP multiplier.\n\n#### The Program Fails Its Supporters\u2019 Goals\n\nEven delegates who supported the program\u2019s goals, like\u00a0**L2BEAT**, have seen it fail.\u00a0[@krst](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/krst) Urba\u0144ski of L2BEAT stated the DIP should help top delegates afford staff and reward passionate, smaller delegates. Version 1.6 did the exact opposite: it punished smaller delegates and failed to hold large, inactive delegates accountable for their lack of participation. The program has failed to achieve the very outcomes that its key supporters envisioned.\n\n### The Program Fails Its Own Approved KPIs.\n\nThe original v1.5 proposal, approved on-chain, included specific KPIs set by\u00a0[@SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov). The program is now failing to meet them.\n\n> As a reminder, these were the approved KPIs of the DIP, as per the\u00a0[onchain approval](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/7979895167029508946638584765496434407327098393519089113101189960001594458109?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4)\u00a0of the original DIP 1.5 version.\n> \n> > ## KPIs\n> > \n> > In this new iteration of the DIP, we aim to establish the following KPIs:\n> > \n> > * Achieve that 50 delegates receive incentives.\n> > * Engage 100 delegates in the program.\n> > * Achieve an average Total Participation (TP) of 80% among participants in the program within six months.\n> > * Introduce improvements to the program after six months.\n\nIn the replies to this proposal, Paulo Fonseca has done a deep dive into the KPIs\u00a0[@SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov) hosted during the v1.5 vote\n\n![From:  Paulo Fonseca](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2b2b2cf1783a3cf74145bca7e48856f5134baffd_2_690x388.jpeg)\n\n#### Delegates Are Losing Confidence\n\nThe most experienced delegates are walking away because the program is unstable.\n\n> _\u201cWe\u2019re now reducing involvement as we can\u2019t know what (if any) compensation we will receive. Working up front without knowing if or how much you\u2019ll be paid_\u00a0**_isn\u2019t sustainable_**\u00a0_.\u201d_ \u2014 cr1st0f, representing ACI, a major protocol delegate\n\n> _\u201cMost professional delegates would prefer some baseline/bottom line assurance.

Instead of fixing the problems, they doubled down on them:\n\n1. **More Elitism:**\u00a0They proposed raising the minimum VP for new delegates\u00a0**from 50k to 500k**, effectively closing the door on new community members.\n2. **Pay Cuts for Delegates, Raises for Managers:**\u00a0They proposed a\u00a0**~40% pay cut for all delegates**\u00a0while simultaneously asking for a\u00a0**25% raise for themselves.**\n3. **No Accountability:**\u00a0They proposed removing the ability for delegates to dispute subjective scoring, cementing their own power.\n\nThis proposal is not a good-faith effort to improve the program. It is an attempt to silence critics, entrench power, and reward the program\u2019s managers at the expense of the delegates.\n\n### The Solution: Roll Back to v1.5\n\nThe community feedback has been clear: the DIP should continue, but not in its current broken state. The predatory changes from v1.6 and v1.7 must be removed. Rolling back to v1.5 will restore a stable, predictable, and inclusive program that allows delegates of all sizes to contribute meaningfully to the DAO.\n\n> At SEEDGov, we remain committed to continuously gathering community feedback and making the necessary decisions to ensure that Arbitrum DAO has the best Delegate Program in the space.\n\nWe ask that\u00a0[@SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov)\u00a0honours this commitment and respects the community\u2019s feedback by supporting this rollback.\n\n**By voting to revert to v1.5, we will:**\n\n1. **Restore a More Effective Program:**\u00a0The v1.5 framework was more cost-effective, with a higher percentage of the budget going directly to a larger number of active delegates, rather than being concentrated among a few or covering bloated administrative costs.\n2. **Encourage Authentic Participation:**\u00a0Version 1.5\u2019s clearer, more objective criteria rewarded consistent, good-faith participation. It provided a reliable foundation that encouraged delegates to invest their time and resources in governance.\n3. **Restore Fairness and Transparency:**\u00a0Reverting to v1.5 eliminates the unfair \u201ccaste system\u201d and the subjective \u201cblack box\u201d scoring. It re-establishes a level playing field where all delegates are judged by the same transparent standards.\n\n### Voting\n\nVoting Strategy: Ranked choice voting\nVoting Privacy: Shielded Voting\nVoting options:\n\n1.

To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time \"Stylus Sprint\" program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks and the program will run for 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign's primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.\n\nInterested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Application Process & RFP Details:\n\nAs mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nThe application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.\n\nTeams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.\n\n### Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors\n\nTo effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Additionally, a group of advisors will provide consultative support to the committee. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. Currently, there are limited experts qualified to assess Stylus applications effectively. However, should the DAO prefer to engage in a broader selection process that we believe would be inefficient and lead to a less successful program, Entropy Advisors is more than happy to facilitate an RFP process instead, contingent upon a DAO vote to define and appoint these roles.\n\nEvaluation Committee\n\n1. Stylus Team Members - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n2. Dev Team - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n3. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n4. Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n5. Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n\nCommittee Advisors\n\n1. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe Committee Advisors\u2019 main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. **Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.**\n\nJudges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 2 months will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. **Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.** In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program.\n\n### Multisig Setup\n\nThe Stylus Sprint multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program and 150K ARB for payments to judges. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.\n\n### Funding Levels and Disbursement\n\nTeams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K, 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones.\n\nUnallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don\u2019t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.\n\nFunding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. 50% of funds will be distributed after deployment to encourage teams to think about growth and sustainability post-launch. The criteria for these 2 checkpoints will be proposed by teams in their applications.\n\nAll projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. The above milestone structure, however, is not required. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above. The evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Stylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024\n2. Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024\n3. On-Chain Vote - Sept 12, 2024\n6. Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 4, 2024\n\nThe program will begin on the Monday following the onchain proposal\u2019s passing. The first 2 weeks will be used to refine and post the RFPs, followed by open applications for 8 weeks, then a 2-week application review process.

This treasury asset purchase was a part of the STEP 1 program. Following Anchorage Digital Acquiring Mountain and the [announced wind-down](https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/usdm-wind-down-overview) of USDM, the Arbitrum Foundation has already redeemed the entirety of the DAO\u2019s USDM position, which is now in USDC. This proposal reallocates the fully redeemed funds (~$3.5M USDC) to the STEP 2 budget.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale:\n\nThis is a straightforward administrative action to ensure the assets allocated to STEP remain yield bearing. At an estimated 4.5% on $3.5M, the DAO is missing out on ~$13k per month while these funds sit in USDC. Given the extremely recent review of RWAs and acceptance of the STEP 2 allocation, this is a simple path forward that the committee believes should enable these assets to get to work in high-quality yield-bearing assets.\n\nFor further context, the STEP 2 budget has been partially liquidated, but some of the allocated ARB is still awaiting swapping. Additionally, none of the STEP 2 funds have been allocated yet (in progress).\n\n## Specifications\n\nThis proposal, if passed via Snapshot with more votes For than Against, will enable the Arbitrum Foundation to move all funds redeemed from USDM into the previously approved STEP 2 allocation:\n\n* [WisdomTree WTGXX](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wisdomtree-wtgxx-step-application/28756): 30%\n* [Spiko USTBL](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-2-application-spiko-ustbl/28752): 35%\n* [Franklin Templeton FOBXX (BENJI)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/franklin-onchain-u-s-government-money-fund-fobxx-step-application/23655): 35%\n\n## Budget\n\nThis proposal requires no additional funds from the DAO and will proceed to Snapshot Thursday June 5th.\n\n*Disclaimer The information provided in this proposal is for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.

The Arbitrum DAO treasury address holds 3,54B ARB tokens, and an unexpected $69,4M of unclaimed individual ARB airdrops were recently returned to the DAO treasury. The treasury is exceptionally well funded, and it\u2019s important to note that the DAO fully controls the usage of the Arbitrum DAO treasury and that all surplus revenues belong to the DAO. This includes sequencer revenues.\n\nWe believe that the Arbitrum token needs a staking mechanism. We propose creating a mechanism that distributes ARB to token lockers. A locking mechanism would incentivize long-term token holders and become a fundamental building block for future token utility proposals (e.g., distributing sequencer revenues).\n\nAlong with creating a locking mechanism, we propose requesting 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total ARB token supply from the Arbitrum DAO treasury and distributing this over 12 months through the proposed locking mechanism. The final amount would be decided with a Snapshot and that decision cemented on-chain with a Tally vote. We suggest that the \u2018Arbitrum Coalition\u2019 gathers data and monitors the impacts of this staking mechanism over the 12-month period and potentially audits the contracts if funded in time. Of course, this relationship is reliant on both proposals passing and the DAO and Coalition Advocate supporting the scope of work for the coalition. The goal is to use these insights to give the DAO the data and tools to refine the ARB staking mechanism further.\n\nIt is important to note that this proposal is entirely separate from the ongoing liquidity incentives framework and grant discussion. Both can and should co-exist - Arbitrum should have a functional grants framework and a staking mechanism. The Arbitrum DAO STIP program has recently concluded, and 50M ARB tokens will enter the market over the coming months. As proposed here, a supply sink through staking would benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIn the discussions over the previous months, we\u2019ve seen the legal aspect be a deterrent to sharing value with ARB token holders in the form of revenue. The way we are proposing the staking mechanism through using existing treasury funds to reward lockers in ARB is the most palatable option from a legal perspective, as it does not involve sharing revenues. It also does not rule out the possibility of later moving on to a model that allows for other value accrual methods to the token. Should our proposal pass, when additional value accrual methods are proposed and the legal landscape is more mature and better understood, the process will likely be much quicker since a staking mechanism is already in use with audited contracts in place.\n\nWe thank the following delegates and others for their valuable feedback while drafting this proposal.\n\nWestie from Blockworks Research\nCoinflipcanada\nAnd several others\n\n# Motivation\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem would benefit in multiple ways from a staking mechanism that is constructed to heavily align incentives with those most aligned with the ecosystem long-term. While staking mechanisms are familiar and a mainstay across DeFi, sustainable models and their impact on the token in question have been scarcely studied. These staking mechanisms are often poorly designed and have rampant inflation that negatively affects the token.\n\nRegarding staking mechanisms, there are few examples to model after in the Layer 2 token space. We propose that the Arbitrum ecosystem takes the first step in this endeavor and leads the way - as it already does in many other verticals. We believe that to construct a long-term staking mechanism that is sustainable, there is first a need to gather actual data that is strictly specific to the Arbitrum ecosystem and the ARB token.\n\nBecause of this, we propose that the \u2018Arbitrum Coalition\u2019 monitors the effects of this 12-month staking experiment and provides quarterly updates on the impacts of the mechanism through dashboards and qualitative reporting. After the 12-month staking experiment is over, we suggest that the DAO funds the \u2018Arbitrum Coalition\u2019 to produce a comprehensive report with results and recommendations on what they believe is the most sustainable way forward in building a staking mechanism and incentive model that is sustainable yet attractive for the ARB token. The expertise of the \u2018Arbitrum Coalition\u2019 is perfectly suited for analyzing the results of this experiment, given that Gauntlet is an industry-leading authority in tokenomics design, Blockworks spearheads the industry\u2019s research efforts and Trail of Bits is a top-tier security organization. To read more about the Arbitrum Coalition, please visit their proposal here.\n\n# Broader Implications for Arbitrum\nThis proposal passing would have extremely positive implications for the entire Arbitrum ecosystem. Having a native staking model that the DAO officially approves would be likely to have the following consequences:\n\n- Significantly increase interest in Arbitrum and the ARB token\n- Allow for composability around an ARB token that can earn yield\n- Reward long-term aligned stakers with yield while penalizing mercenary capital and short-term actors\n- Positively differentiate ARB from any other L2 tokens and bring the spotlight back to Arbitrum\n- Offer a first step and infrastructure towards introducing different forms of revenue sharing in the future\n\nThese are some of the benefits that will likely result from having a staking mechanism; however, verifying these predictions\u2019 accuracy by an independent third party such as the \u2018Arbitrum Coalition\u2019 is important. These hypotheses cannot be truly verified without actual data, highlighting the importance of a 12-month trial period for staking.\n\n# Benefits for Users\nBy introducing a staking contract that responsibly distributes the allotted amount of tokens to users who are willing to lock their ARB, the incentives are aligned in a way that rewards those parties most loyal to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes long-term holders of ARB and DAOs that have received an airdrop and are willing to lock their tokens.\n\nThe figures below detail possible APRs for stakers at different staked percentages if 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total supply was distributed annually. The current circulating supply of ARB is approximately 1.275B.\n\n![87f8dc9e506d60ebd15f3098d0ff626ee8453c71.png](ipfs://bafkreifv3akc3qub3mmknewbcjwchy2vc7astm2wp33occluoj4r576lu4)\n\n# Specification\n- The ARB staking contract will allow users to lock their ARB for up to 365 calendar days. A user\u2019s weight is proportional to their lock time.\n- Users may increase their lock times.\n- Users may pause their lock times (meaning the time to unlock does not increase this saves having to relock continuously)\n- Users may have many independent locks.\n- Users will receive and may claim ARB emissions according to their weight.\n- Users may exit their lock for a penalty between 0-60% of their lock amount, linear vs. lock time remaining (365 days remaining would mean a 60% penalty, and 0 days would be a 0% penalty). This penalty is shared between remaining users according to weight.\n\nExample usage: ARB locker\n\n- The user locks 100 ARB for 365 days.\n   - The lock weight formula is (ARB amount locked * lock time / 365)\n   - Their ARB lock \u2018weight\u2019 is currently 100 (100 ARB * 365/365).\n   - All rewards are distributed based on a user\u2019s weight / the total sum of all the users\u2019 weights.\n- After 182.5 days, the user will have a lock \u2018weight\u2019 of 50 (100 ARB * 182.5/365).\n   - At this point, they may increase their lock time, do nothing, or withdraw.\n   - The early exit penalty is (0.6 * lock time / 365)%.\n   - For a lock time of 182.5 days, the penalty is, therefore, 30% of the locked amount - if the user were to withdraw now, they would receive back 70 ARB.\n- ARB staked in this contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1. Why a locking mechanism?\n\nA locking mechanism allows users who are long-term believers in Arbitrum to signal this belief through their actions and get rewarded for it accordingly. Locking for longer is always optional - users may lock for any time period. One year is a reasonable lock time compared to the previously popular 4-year locking model. A one-year lock is not too long to the point of disincentiving locking, as users can choose the lock duration. Not only does this give individuals optionality and a mechanism to earn a native yield on their ARB tokens, but it also gives protocols that were a part of the DAO airdrop or have otherwise accumulated ARB a mechanism to earn on their treasury.\n\n2. What are the consequences of this proposal?\n\nUltimately, this proposal introduces utility to ARB and gives users more incentive to hold. In addition, long-term believers will be net increasing their network share, which sets up a base from which we can build further proposals for ARB value accrual without worrying about the distribution mechanism.\n\n3. What would this staking mechanism mean for delegation?\n\nFrom a user standpoint, it\u2019s important to note that the ARB staked in the proposed contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length. The staking contract will be upgradeable and controlled by the DAO - this ensures that the DAO can pause this distribution at any time.\n\n# Summary\nAs it stands today, ARB has no native utility or yield. We propose approving the creation of the staking contract detailed above and distributing an equivalent of 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25%, or 1% of the total ARB supply from the DAO treasury to the staking contract. These tokens would be distributed over a 12-month period, during which the \u2018Arbitrum Coalition\u2019 could - pending their proposal passing - monitor the impacts of the proposed staking mechanism and draft a report and recommendations by the end of the period. Note that the Arbitrum Coalition proposal is entirely separate yet synergistic to this proposal. The passing of either proposal is not conditional on the other proposal\u2019s performance.\n\nIt\u2019s important to highlight that to move toward a final and refined version of value accrual to the ARB token, trial and experimentation is required. We believe there is a strong need for actual data from a live staking mechanism, such as the one suggested in this proposal, from the unique context of Arbitrum\u2019s growing ecosystem to make more informed decisions on what the ultimate mechanism for ARB staking and value accrual might look like.\n\nInnovation has always been Arbitrum\u2019s forte in both technical advancements and building a vibrant community - we believe that the approach to building a cutting-edge staking model for ARB through trial and experimentation is a logical way forward.\n\n# Timeline\nThis proposal will follow the official lifecycle of an AIP detailed here. Please note that this proposal is a non-constitutional proposal.\n\nThe suggested timeline can be found below.\n\nWeek 36-37 - Forum post, request for comments and feedback (Complete)\nWeek 43-44 - Temperature check forum post & Snapshot poll (1 week)\nWeek 45 - Formal AIP and call-for-voting (3 days)\nWeek 45-46 - On-chain DAO vote on Tally (14 days)\nWeek 47 onwards - Implementation phase\n\nIf the proposal passes, a draft of the implementation phase is detailed below in \u201cSuggested Steps to Implement.\u201d The final implementation schedule depends on the result of the vendor decision proposal, community review, audit schedules, and subsequent findings. A concrete schedule for the implementation stage will thus be locked in at a later stage.\n\n# Voting Options on Snapshot\nWhen this proposal moves to Snapshot, there will be five voting options. The voting method will be ranked choice voting. To read more about ranked choice voting, please visit this article from Snapshot.\n\n1. Fund staking with 1.75% of the total ARB supply (175M ARB tokens)\n2. Fund staking with 1.5% of the total ARB supply (150M ARB tokens)\n3. Fund staking with 1.25% of the total ARB supply (125M ARB tokens)\n4. Fund staking with 1% of the total ARB supply (100M ARB tokens)\n5. Do not fund staking\n\n# Suggested Steps to Implement\n1. The Arbitrum DAO will receive another proposal concerning implementation, which will aim to decide the vendor of the implementation and associated contracts and an auditor.\n2. After the contracts and audits are finished, they will be provided to the community for review for two weeks.\n3. After the community review period, the contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum, and the ownership will be transferred to the DAO.\n4. Ratification of reimbursement of costs as illustrated in the Cost sections below and disbursement of such reimbursements to applicable service providers\n\n# Costs\nThe costs of this proposal are mainly related to the implementation process, during which a vendor and auditor will be decided.

This is the first of a series of upcoming proposals under the umbrella of a DAO Incentive Program (DIP 2.1).\n\n# Motivation and Rationale\nA delegate is defined as a party with voting power who votes on proposals. It narrowly focuses on voting and aiding sentiment analysis of why a proposal passed (or failed).\n\nWith this in mind, there are three overarching goals that this program is trying to achieve:\n* **Increased active voting power.** The total amount of active voting power is steadily increasing over time.\n* **Reduce voter apathy.** The share of active voting power compared to total delegated voting power is increasing over time.\n* **Sentiment analysis.** Sufficient publicly available information to aid understanding and gain insight on decisions made by the DAO.\n\nThis program can be considered successful if delegates are incentivized to continue participating and new delegates step up to participate in the DAO\u2019s voting system. As well, if a proposal does fail, then the proposer should have the ability to gauge sentiment of various voters across the DAO based on the public feedback they leave on the forum. \n\n# Specification\nThis program is designed to be objective and on a per-proposal basis.\n\n## Eligibility requirements\nAny delegate who has satisfied the following eligibility criteria can receive a payment provided that:\n* **Actionable requirements:**\n   * They cast a vote on a proposal,\n   * They publicly post rationale for how they voted and why (within 5 days of a proposal ending).\n\n* **Prior requirements:**\n   * They have cast votes in at least 75% of all proposals in a given month,\n   * They expressed interest to participate in the program and passed compliance requirements with the OpCo,\n   * They have the minimum voting power (specified in budget),\n   * Sufficient votes (FOR/ABSTAIN/AGAINST) cast that achieves quorum target*,\n   * The proposal follows the process outlined in the Arbitrum Constitution.\n\nAdditionally, delegates must adhere to the [program\u2019s terms and conditions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CEQc0o-FSAakgFL8wbTiqzeX-PtC5TBHj0BjonFNftI/edit?usp=sharing) in order to remain eligible. Any proposals related to this program will not be eligible for rewards, to avoid any possible conflicts of interest.\n\n**AGAINST does not typically count towards quorum, but for the purpose of this program, it will be included in the count towards quorum for the purpose of issuing rewards. The intention is to enable delegates to vote according to their preference such that \u2018quorum\u2019 is always hit even if not officially.*\n\n## Incentive Budget per Quarter\n|Proposal type|Incentive Budget|Payout Cap|Minimum voting power|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|On-chain constitutional quorum|15,000 USD|700 USD|200k ARB|\n|On-chain non-constitutional quorum|7,000 USD|500 USD|200k ARB|\n|Off-chain decision making (non-constitutional)|7,000 USD|500 USD|200k ARB|\n|Off-chain election|7,000 USD|500 USD|200k ARB|\n|Off-chain temperature check (non-binding)|5,000 USD|300 USD|200k ARB|\n\n*Table 1: Incentive Budget from November 1st 2025 to January 31st 2026*\n\nEvery quarter (3 months), the OpCo will decide an incentive budget that is paid on a per-proposal basis, with the following information: \n* **Proposal type:** Type of decision voted on by the DAO,\n* **Incentive budget:** Budget allocated to a single proposal,\n* **Payout caps (per proposal):** Maximum incentive grant a delegate can receive from this proposal,\n* **Minimum voting power:** A delegate must have at least this amount voting power at the start of a proposal's voting period and must also maintain an average voting power at or above this threshold throughout the relevant month, to be eligible for rewards.\n\nThe budget is expected to be shared at the start of every quarter and to remain in effect for that quarter. This will provide delegates with predictability on the reward structure while allowing the payout strategies to change over time. For clarity, the proposal\u2019s end date for voting (whether on-chain or off-chain) will be the date used to decide which payout strategy is used. **All payouts will be issued in ARB tokens with a 7-day TWAP.**\n\nTable 1 provides the initial incentive budget that will be adopted if the proposal is passed. An illustration of how the payouts may look for the DIP 1.7 September Cohort and if all voting power was eligible for the program, can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sk5DATJ16_4tTBHYkwvwE7yI65sThjHCq8skdzSeFFo/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nRewards are calculated relative to:\n\n* A delegate\u2019s share of total eligible voting power,\n* The portion of the incentive budget remaining at the time of allocation,\n* A payment cap that limits the maximum a single delegate can receive.\n\nThis is designed to ensure the entire incentive budget for a proposal is fully allocated and the rewards are distributed fairly among the delegates.\n\nThe key finding is that the payout cap in the September Cohort effectively redistributes rewards across the delegate set and prevents concentration among those with the highest voting power. This mechanism ensures all participating delegates receive some reward. However, as the total eligible voting power increases to ~300m, the influence of the payout cap becomes less pronounced.\n\nIf we assume, in a given month, there are two temperature check proposals followed by a non-constitutional proposal and constitutional proposal, then the DAO as a collective will spend ~$32k.\n\nBased on the DIP 1.7\u2019s September Cohort data, we estimate the following payments for certain sized delegates:\n* Above 8 million votes will earn ~$1.8k,\n* Above 4 million votes will earn ~$1.6k,\n* Above 1 million votes will earn ~$900.\n\nThe estimates are subject to change based on participation by voting power. As more voting power participates, the rewards will be diluted, and it will be up to the OpCo every quarter to evaluate this data to set a new budget.\n\nThe following metric will be used to track the cost-effectiveness of the program: \n- **Dollar spent per vote cast.** A cost-efficiency metric that measures the total program expenditure divided by the number of votes incentivized. It represents how much funding is required to generate a single vote through the program. \n\nDollar spent per vote, alongside rewards on a per-proposal basis, enables the DAO to explicitly define a collective cost for the passage of a proposal. The program will need to find a balance that sufficiently rewards delegates to keep them engaged, and onboard newcomers, while keeping a keen eye on the collective cost to the DAO for the passage of a proposal.\n\n## Tracking of Rewards\nThe OpCo is responsible for keeping track of all rewards for delegate voting. It should be available on a public spreadsheet. For clarity, all records should be kept on a per calendar month basis, and payouts should be issued shortly after month\u2019s end. If a proposal's voting phase starts in one month and ends in the next, it will count towards the month in which it ends. When payouts are computed, the program manager (who could either be OpCo or another party) should accurately keep track of total accrued rewards and total payouts, to ensure only the difference carries over to the next month.\n\nDelegates must earn at least $100 before a payment is issued. The allocation will carry over to the next calendar month, but it will expire after 3 months if the threshold is not reached. This is simply to avoid sending dust transactions alongside the overhead in doing so.\n\n## Safe-guard Budget\n\nThe OpCo reserves the right to offer **bespoke incentive grant budgets** for specific proposals. For example, if a proposal requires multiple temperature check proposals at the same time (like in the STIP), then all proposals may fall within a single bespoke incentive budget.\n\nThe OpCo may decide not to offer any reward. This should be taken in cases to **prevent potential abuse** such as an avalanche of unnecessary proposals or proposals that are deemed very minor in nature (including canceled proposals). If so, the rationale should be published prior or during the respective proposal\u2019s voting phase.\n\n## Facilitated by the OpCo\nThe Arbitrum OpCo Foundation (\u201cOpCo\u201d) retains the authority to change any aspect of the program and any major change should be published to the DAO.\n\nAdditionally, the OpCo are in charge of hiring (and terminating) a program manager (if they choose to do so) with an appropriate service level agreement. It is expected that the program manager will handle the day-to-day operations, but rely on instructions from the OpCo.\n\nThis program will initially be run by the Arbitrum Foundation, but will be handed over with the OpCo as it ramps up its own resources to run DAO-programs. For clarity, anything that states \u201cOpCo\u201d in this proposal will be handled by the Arbitrum Foundation from the onset.\n\n## Participation Depends on Delegates being Non-Sybil and Human\nThe program\u2019s goal is to activate unique and human delegates who will express their opinion through voting and sharing rationales. The program will exclude platforms that enable non-human activity (i.e., AI agents) or enable token holders who sell their votes for short-term profits. Additionally, no Arbitrum Aligned Entity nor the program manager will be allowed to earn any incentive payouts.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe Delegate Incentive Program [multisig](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=arb1:0x07e7ef4B87Bb4115f7f507C89c2baC5F3342Cc3c) is holding approximately 7 million ARB. This program, alongside upcoming proposals under the umbrella of a DAO incentive program, will absorb the entire budget.\n\nThe OpCo will use this budget for:\n\n* Payouts related to the program,\n* Program manager compensation,\n* Other miscellaneous costs that arise.\n\nThe program manager\u2019s compensation and scope of work will be announced if and when it is negotiated by the OpCo. This will be periodically reviewed by the OpCo and any changes will be published to the DAO.\n\nWe do not expect miscellaneous costs to be substantial. An initial budget of $50k per year will be allocated. If the costs exceed this budget, then the OpCo\u2019s OAT must approve and notify the DAO.\n\nFinally, a transparency report will be prepared and published every 6 months, to track total spend of any program that falls under the umbrella of a DAO Incentive Program.\n\n# Timeline\nThe intention is for the RAD program to run for 1 year. If the OpCo, based on feedback, deems the program is running well, it may authorise the program to continue operating beyond 1 year. If not, any excess funds will be returned to the DAO Treasury.\n\nThe off-chain proposal was posted on December 4th, 2025. A non-constitutional quorum is required alongside more FOR than AGAINST votes for the proposal to pass. \n\nIf passed, the program will retrospectively take into account any proposals conducted after the 1st November 2025, and issue rewards in a timely manner.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "e17539e4-5f62-4d12-90e4-f2c41cfbfbb1", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x5824d0b51cc435a49f6455ee2715216d6b958637218ed79e3e93c41af6bdef33", "title": "GovMonth Sensemaking - Growth and Innovation", "author_name": "0xf9551c66995eD3Ff9bb05C9Fd7ff148Bd75dc99a", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5824d0b51cc435a49f6455ee2715216d6b958637218ed79e3e93c41af6bdef33", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-09-27 12:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-04 12:00:00", "options": {"scores": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31871332.00648964, 0, 0, 21678894.16051554], "choices": ["Statement 1", "Statement 2", "Statement 3", "Statement 4", "Statement 5", "Statement 6", "Statement 7", "Statement 8", "Statement 9", "Statement 10"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-04 12:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.621", "body": "As #GovMonth is reaching its end, it's time to reflect on the initiatives of last month and think about where we go next.

Since it serves as a continuation of, and builds upon learnings from the [Delegate Incentive Program](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/7979895167029508946638584765496434407327098393519089113101189960001594458109?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4), we refer to it as DIP 2.0.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* **Delegate:** A party with voting power used to vote on proposals, eligible for voting activity-related incentives.\n* **Contributor:** A party who positively supports ArbitrumDAO governance and/or the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* **Peer Assembly:** A peer-to-peer community group enabling contributors to receive rewards.\n  * **Vouches:** Public endorsements from existing members and Arbitrum Aligned Entities (AAEs), required for new members to join the Peer Assembly.\n* **Peer Recognition:** A monthly reward system for impactful contributions to the ArbitrumDAO/wider ecosystem.\n  * **Peer Assembly Recommendations:** Submissions made by Peer Assembly members and AAEs to nominate impactful contributions for rewards.\n* **Nudge Seasons:** Time-bound initiatives to encourage specific positive behaviors among contributors.\n* **OpCo:** The AAE overseeing the DIP 2.0, authorized to modify the program, hire/terminate the Program Manager, and approve budgets.\n* **Program Manager:** The team hired by the OpCo to handle day-to-day operations of the DIP 2.0.\n\n# Motivation and Rationale\nWe propose a new incentive program for the ArbitrumDAO that separates out rewards for delegates and contributors:\n\n* **Delegate.** A party with voting power with the capability to vote on proposals.\n* **Contributor.** A party who positively supports ArbitrumDAO governance and/or the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nA delegate can be a contributor, but we should not assume that a contributor must be a delegate. \n\nThe incentive reward paid to delegates will only focus on their voting record and making public the rationale behind their decision. On the other hand, for contributors, there will be two forms of rewards available:\n* **Peer recognition program.** Focus on identifying impactful contributions in the DAO based on the recommendation of their peers.\n* **Nudge seasons.** Nudge the behaviour of contributors towards actions that are perceived as positive for the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nWe note the DAO incentive program should not replace a salary-like paid role or be sufficient to self-sustain an individual. However, it could be a stepping stone to enable parties to eventually find part time or full time work in the ecosystem. Most importantly, all payments should be viewed as a \u2018thank you\u2019 from others in the community. \n\nTo make the above work, we also propose introducing an **Arbitrum Peer Assembly** via a peer-to-peer vouching system. It requires existing members and/or AAEs to vouch for others to join before they are eligible for any payments, for delegates and/or contributors, in the DAO incentive program. The vouching system is designed to allow members to hold each other accountable and boost comradery among participants.\n\n# Specification\n## Rewarding Active Delegates\n\nThis program is designed to be objective and on a per-proposal basis. Any member of the Arbitrum Peer Assembly is eligible to receive a payment provided they:\n\n* Cast a vote on a proposal,\n* Publicly post rationale for how they voted and why.\n\n### Tracking Active Voters\n\nLong-term program objectives are measured through the following key performance indicators:\n\n* **Increased active voting power.** The total amount of active voting power is steadily increasing over time.\n* **Reduced voter apathy.** The share of active voting power compared to total delegated voting power is increasing over time.\n\nThe following metric will be used to track the cost-effectiveness of the program:\n\n* **Dollar spent per vote cast.** A cost-efficiency metric that measures the total program expenditure divided by the number of votes incentivized in a proposal. It represents how much funding is required to generate a single vote through the program.\n\nThe cost-efficiency metric should find a fair cost per vote that encourages delegates to participate without overspending the budget. For example, if the incentive budget per proposal is $10,000 and if the program manager decides to incentivize up to 200,000,000 votes per proposal, then the dollar spent per vote cast is 0.00005.\n\n### Periodic Incentive Budget\n\n|Proposal type|Incentive Budget|Payout Cap|Reward Distribution|Contributor Bonus|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|On-chain constitutional|10,000 ARB|700 ARB|Proportional to voting power|1,000 ARB|\n|On-chain funding transfer|8,000 ARB|500 ARB|Proportional to voting power|1,000 ARB|\n|Off-chain decision making|8,000 ARB|500 ARB|Proportional to voting power|0 ARB|\n|Off-chain temperature check (non-binding)|3,000 ARB|300 ARB|Quadratic relative to voting power|0 ARB|\n\n*Table 1: A hypothetical illustration of incentive grant budget for delegate rewards*\n\nAs seen in Table 1, the program manager, in agreement with the OpCo, is required to set out an incentive grant budget that is paid on a per-proposal basis:\n\n* **Proposal type.** Type of decision voted on by the DAO,\n* **Incentive budget.** Budget allocated to a single proposal,\n* **Reward distribution curve.** Strategy for allocating the incentive grant to active voting power,\n* **Payout caps (per proposal).** Maximum incentive grant a delegate can receive from this vote.\n* **Contributor bonus.** A bonus that is split between assembly members nominated by the proposal author.\n\nThe incentive grant budget for proposals that are published within a 3-month period must be shared at the start of every 3-month period by the program manager alongside an optional maximum cap for the entire period. \n\nThe intention is to provide delegates with predictability on the reward structure in the coming months while allowing the payout strategies to change over time. For example, as seen in Table 1, if an on-chain constitutional proposal is voted on by the DAO, then a 10k ARB incentive grant will be allocated for that specific proposal. \n\nThe program manager, in agreement with the OpCo, reserves the right to offer **bespoke incentive grant budgets** for specific proposals. For example, if the DAO is required to participate in several sub-proposals within a single initiative (like in the STIP), then all such proposals may fall within a single bespoke incentive budget. They may decide not to offer any reward in order to prevent potential abuse such as an avalanche of unnecessary proposals or decisions that are deemed very minor in nature (including cancelled proposals). If so, the rationale should be published prior or during the on-chain/off-chain proposal by the program manager.\n\nThe **contributor bonus** allows the proposal author to nominate contributors who made a meaningful impact on the proposal. This is not limited to posts on the forum, but any communication medium that enables the contributor to support the proposal author. The proposal author can name a handful of contributors alongside a short description on each contributor\u2019s impact on the proposal. This is sent to the program manager, who will then publish it to the DAO. The bonus will be split between the named contributors. The contributor bonus is optional and it should be viewed as a small \u2018thank you\u2019 for making the proposal better.\n\nFinally, the **incentive budget should define a minimum voting power** required to be eligible for delegate rewards. It will apply across all proposal types. This should be set to a reasonable value to help reduce the overhead of tracking rewards.\n\n## Peer Recognition Program for DAO Contributors\n\nThe program is designed to recognise contributors who have made meaningful contributions to the ArbitrumDAO or the wider ecosystem as acknowledged by their peers.\n\n### Eligible Contributions\n\nThe contribution should be:\n\n* Worthy in stature such that there is likely to be no objection that the work deserves praise among the DAO,\n* Not solely restricted to activities within the DAO, but any contribution that aids and strengthens the Arbitrum ecosystem,\n* Focused on voluntary activities, but eventually recognized by others as impactful.\n\nThe program may reward recurring tasks, but it should be an exception. For example, if a contributor hosts a monthly call, this will not result in a payout being issued every month.\n\n### Rankings and Rewards\n\nThe program manager is expected to act as an ordering service:\n\n* Review all recommendations,\n* Pick a final ordering,\n* Require approval from the OpCo (including any required modifications).\n\nThe full final ranking will not be publicly released. Only the top N recommendations, where N is a program-defined threshold, will be published to the DAO. Each selected recommendation from the top N will receive a fixed payout.\n\nAdditionally, if there is an outstanding contribution, the program manager (with agreement from the OpCo), can issue a \u2018special reward\u2019 with a higher payout. These should be rare and generally a moment of great praise.\n\nInitial Configuration for Peer Recognition Program.\n* $500 in ARB per recommendation,\n* N=5, top 5 recommendations,\n* Up to $2,500 in ARB per-month for the outstanding contribution reward.\n\nFor clarity, there is no obligation to publish exactly N recommendations every month. Only those deemed worthy of a reward should be published and in some months there may be none. If there are too many worthy contributions to fit within a single month, then the program manager can carry some over to future months, to ensure that eligible contributions are eventually recognized.\n\n### Submission process\n\nEvery month, the program manager will request all members of the Arbitrum Peer Assembly, as well as AAEs, to submit their recommendations. It should be written in the following format:\n\n* Contributor\u2019s name:\n* Contribution:\n* Why was it impactful:\n\nNote, the recommendation should be concise and easy to digest as it will be published (alongside the reward) if it is chosen by the program manager. A participant can also submit a recommendation that covers their own actions.\n\nThe recommendation must be sent privately to the program manager. It is up to the recommender to ensure the program manager has acknowledged that it was indeed received by them.\n\n*For Example:*\n\n* *Contributor\u2019s name: tnorm*\n* *Contribution: Shepherding the STIP proposal*\n* *Why was it impactful: The DAO was in a gridlock. Camelot\u2019s proposal had failed, not because it was bad, but other DeFi protocols wanted access to incentive grants too. It became a tragedy of the commons that tnorm was able to resolve. He helped push a proposal through the DAO that enabled the wider community to decide the allocation of incentive grants and gave all protocols a fair shot at receiving them.*\n\n### Review process\n\nThe program manager will collect and review all recommendations. It is their job to rank the recommendations according to a set of principles. For example:\n\n* **Originality & Initiative.** Did the contributor proactively identify and address a gap or need?\n* **Arbitrum\u2019s image.** Does the contribution enhance the overall perception of Arbitrum in the wider community?\n* **Knowledge sharing.** Has the contributor made their work accessible so others in the DAO can learn from it?\n* **Impact.** Did the contribution meaningfully advance an initiative that would otherwise have slowed in progress, stalled, or simply failed?\n* **Sustainability & Relevancy.** Can the work be maintained, scaled or built upon by the DAO?\n* **Peer Recognition.** Would other contributors and delegates widely acknowledge this as a meaningful and worthy contribution?\n\nOf course, we expect other considerations to arise over time and this list should not be viewed as exhaustive. The list simply helps set the tone on what it means for a contribution worthy of stature. An updated list of principles will be published to the DAO periodically to ensure everyone is aware of the criteria used to rank the recommendations.\n\n## Nudging Contributor Behaviour\n\nThe program is designed to nudge certain behaviours of participants that can positively impact the Arbitrum ecosystem through the offer of rewards.\n\n### Prior Success\n\nIn the previous iterations of the delegate incentive program, we witnessed delegates perform actions in order to earn rewards, such as leaving comments on the forum, joining governance calls, or voting early in Security Council elections.\n\n### Nudge Season\n\nThe program manager, with agreement of the OpCo, can put together \u2018nudge seasons\u2019 where contributors are offered a reward for performing certain actions within a timeframe. The contributors can provide evidence to the program manager that they have completed the action, as specified by the program manager at the time of the nudge season being announced, and if evaluated by the program manager as doing so, they will then be eligible to receive a payment for doing it.\n\n*For example:*\n\n* *\u201cA budget of 3000 ARB will be split among all voters who cast their vote within the first 5 days of the Security Council elections. It will be paid out proportionally based on the voting power that participates in this nudge season.\u201d* \n\nAnyone who is registered in the DAO incentive program\u2019s Peer Assembly will be eligible as long as they adhere to the conditions of the nudge season. In the above example, whether or not they meet criteria can be proven by on-chain activity.\n\nAll \u2018nudge seasons\u2019 should be accompanied with a single KPI/metric that can be used to evaluate whether it was successful in nudging behaviour. The program manager should provide a small report with data that demonstrates if the KPI was achieved after the nudge season has concluded. \n\nA nudge season can be broad and may cover activity within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This may include participation in governance, helping real-world events or amplifying announcements. What will be nudged is subjective in nature, but when it comes to evaluating whether the behaviour was nudged, that should remain as objective as possible. \n\n## Arbitrum Peer Assembly\n\nThe DAO Incentive Program introduces a new community where parties can only join if they are vouched by existing members and/or AAEs. The intention is to enable the DAO to hold each other accountable to their actions. All payments in the DAO incentive program are contingent upon joining this assembly.\n\n### Bootstrapping Eligible Members\n\nWe have picked the top 8 earners from the soon expiring Delegate Incentive Program from (January - August) 2025 to bootstrap the initial list of eligible members:\n\n* L2Beat\n* Jojo\n* Tekr0x.eth\n* MaxLomu\n* TempeTechie\n* Reverie\n* GFXLabs\n* Gauntlet\n\nThere are some special requirements for these members:\n\n* Must receive 3 vouches within the first 2 months of the program starting,\n* Cannot receive a vouch from someone who they directly vouched to join the program,\n* Initial members cannot vouch for each other.\n\nThe intention to keep this list short is to make this process manageable and it should not be perceived as a special privilege.\n\nAdditionally, to aid the bootstrapping process, all registered members can offer multiple vouches until 50 members have registered in the program. Priority registration will be given to members who were previously registered in DIP v1.7. Once 50 members are registered, then all members will be restricted to 1 vouch per month. \n\n### Vouching Process\n\nA dedicated thread on the Arbitrum Forum should be created for the new member who wants to join:\n* Brief description of the candidate alongside why they want to join,\n* 3 members must reply and publicly vouch for the new member to join.\n\nOnce a member receives enough vouches to join the assembly and assuming any compliance requirements are completed, the new member will then be considered a member of the program and will have the authority to make their own vouch for others to join. As is the case for the initial members, new members also cannot receive a vouch from someone who they directly vouched to join the program. Registration is only finalized once it is confirmed by the program manager on the relevant thread.\n\nIf a member wants to remove their vouch, then they will be required to reply on the same thread that it should be removed.\n\nIf a member has left the program for whatever reason (i.e., inactive), then the relevant forum thread will be locked.\n\n### Tracking of Rewards \nThe Program Manager is responsible for keeping track of all rewards for delegate voting, the peer recognition program, and the nudge seasons. It should be available on a public spreadsheet for all members to access. \n\nFor clarity, all records should be kept on a per calendar month basis, and payouts should be issued shortly after month\u2019s end. When payouts are computed, the program manager should accurately keep track of total accrued rewards and total payouts, to ensure only the difference carries over to the next month. \n\nAll members already registered in the Arbitrum Peer Assembly will automatically accrue rewards. A member must earn at least $200 across the DAO incentive program before a payment is issued. The allocation will carry over to the next calendar month, but it will expire after 3 months if the threshold is not reached. This is simply to avoid sending dust transactions alongside the overhead in doing so. \n\nFinally, non-members who have registered their intent to join the program via the Arbitrum Forum, can accrue rewards. They must complete the vouching and compliance process within the same calendar month that they submit their application to the program, in order to be officially registered into the assembly. If they fail to register by the month\u2019s end, then they will forfeit any accrued rewards.\n\n### Governing Rules\n\nAll members are required to adhere to the [program\u2019s terms and conditions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CEQc0o-FSAakgFL8wbTiqzeX-PtC5TBHj0BjonFNftI/edit?usp=sharing) which outline the expected behaviour of members and how they conduct themselves when interacting with others.\n\nAdditionally, there are some program-specific rules, that will be enforced:\n\n* **Active members only.** If a member has not received any payments in a 6 month period, then they will be removed from the program.\n* **Minimum recommendations.** If a member leaves the program, then the party will have to find a replacement to vouch for them within 2 months.\n* **Non-Transferability.** Membership is tied to a single individual or entity.\n* **Vouch accountability.** If a member is penalized, then the members who vouched for them may also incur a penalty.\n* **One vouch per month.** A member can only vouch for one candidate per month.\n\nFor clarity, it will be the Program Manager\u2019s responsibility, with the OpCo\u2019s approval, to uphold the rules with the ability to suspend or ban members from the Arbitrum Peer Assembly. If there is disagreement with the enforcement, then an appeal can be made to the OpCo who will make the final decision.\n\n### Membership Depends on Humanity\n\nThe DAO Incentive Program\u2019s goal is to activate delegates and contributors who will express their opinion through voting or participating in governance. The program will exclude platforms that enable non-human activity (i.e., AI agents) or enable token holders who sell their votes for short-term profits. Additionally, all organisations classified as an AAE and the Program Manager, will not be allowed to earn any payouts, but will have the power to offer vouches for new members.\n\n## Facilitated by the OpCo\n\nThe Arbitrum OpCo Foundation (\u201cOpCo\u201d) retains the authority to change any aspect of the program. Any major change to the program should be published publicly to notify members of the Arbitrum Peer Assembly.\n\nAdditionally, the OpCo are in charge of hiring (and terminating) the program manager with an appropriate service level agreement. It is expected that the program manager will handle the day-to-day operations, but rely on instructions from the OpCo when necessary.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation, with agreement of the OpCo, will facilitate the program from the get-go with the intention that everything is eventually handed over to the OpCo. We expect different aspects of the DAO incentive program to be handed over as the OpCo ramps up. For clarity, anything that states \u201cOpCo\u201d in this proposal will be handled by the Arbitrum Foundation from the onset.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe Delegate Incentive Program [multisig](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=arb1:0x07e7ef4B87Bb4115f7f507C89c2baC5F3342Cc3c) is still holding approximately 7 million ARB. The DAO incentive program will absorb the entire budget for use in this program.\n\nThe OpCo will use this budget for:\n\n* Payouts related to the program,\n* Program manager compensation,\n* Other miscellaneous costs that arise.\n\nPayouts related to the program, including the delegate rewards, the nudge seasons, and the peer recognition program, will be published to the DAO on a regular basis. For example, in relation to the delegate voting, the budget is allocated every 3 months and the payouts tracked on a per-month basis. This empowers the DAO to monitor how the budget is being used in real-time.\n\nThe program manager\u2019s compensation and scope of work will be announced after it is negotiated by the OpCo. This will be periodically reviewed by the OpCo and any changes will be published to the DAO.\n\nWe do not expect miscellaneous costs to be substantial. An initial budget of $50k per year will be allocated. If the costs exceed this budget, then the OpCo\u2019s OAT must approve and notify the DAO.\n\nFinally, a transparency report will be prepared by the program manager and published every 6 months, to track total spend of the program alongside whether the key performance indicators and other relevant goals are being met.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe official start date will be announced after the proposal has passed and members have begun onboarding to the Arbitrum Peer Assembly. The intention is for the DAO Incentive Program to run for 1 year. If the OpCo, based on feedback from members of the Assembly, deems the program is running well, it may authorise the program to continue operating beyond 1 year. If not, any excess funds will be returned to the DAO Treasury.\n\nThe off-chain proposal was posted on October 23rd and requires a non-constitutional quorum for it to pass. Assuming all goes well, the intention is to begin the program by November 1st, 2025. If the timetable is delayed, for whatever reason, then we plan to still allocate a budget and retrospectively reward any votes that have occurred during the intermission.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "e38dca36-ec4a-4cc0-a7dd-69154a06d367", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x1a4d8072fce74d8fc069cf0ca33fb6348e3aa66ab6369dd3dbcaaff01f2cebbd", "title": "Aave LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0xAD16ebE6FfC7d96624A380F394cD64395B0C6144", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a4d8072fce74d8fc069cf0ca33fb6348e3aa66ab6369dd3dbcaaff01f2cebbd", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [152627576.324008, 28327.631285705032, 1009243.2283954947], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.701", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe well-balanced approach in their grant application suggests they are aware of their marketshare in the money market space, and have structured their grant proposal accounting for the fact that while they are beyond their primary growth phase, that they still have exciting developments to bring to the ecosystem.

It allows the ArbitrumDAO to spend funds from its treasury alongside upgrading any smart contract that governs Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal\u2019s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.\n\nThis proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed. The focus is on the **L2 Core Time Lock** contract that lives on Arbitrum One and proposes changing the delay from 3 days to 8 days which effectively increases the delay by an additional 5 days. Accordingly, the change only applies to constitutional proposals which require upgrades to smart contracts.\n\nThere are two benefits to increasing the delay:\n\n- **Security Council.** The Security Council will have more time to act if a malicious proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO for whatever reason.\n- **Exit window.** Users will have more time to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova if they are worried or not satisfied with how a proposal intends to change the smart contracts that govern Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.\n\nAdditionally, by increasing the exit window, it will also update the status of Arbitrum by L2Beat and replace a red slice with a yellow slice.

We appreciate the team\u2019s commitment to Arbitrum and their continued Arbitrum native roadmap. Additionally, the product has started to catch some traction with their recent incentives mechanism. While their grant ask is a little high for their current usage, we believe the incentives can compliment their recent traction and support further protocol growth benefits. However, their incentive design(bribe mechanism based on veFCTR) does lead to the potential of weak distribution, mainly whales and OGs receiving the majority of rewards. Overall, we feel the benefits outweigh the costs and we support this application. \n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nWe are generally supportive of Factor\u2019s grant application. They have been present in the space for a while with a provable track record and the grant ask seems responsible, along with their proposed plan of action for the grants. Considering Factor is currently in the rollout stage of the product they have spent a long time building, I expect the grant to strengthen this process and be quite cost-effective and based on Factor's incentive strategy outlined in their proposal, We would be inclined to accept the proposal. The strategy demonstrates a clear understanding of how to incentivize user adoption and liquidity depth within the Factor ecosystem on Arbitrum. By leveraging dynamic reward allocation, targeted boost incentives, and enhanced rewards for veFCTR holders, Factor aims to create stickiness among users and ensure sustained engagement over time. The proposed KPIs are well-defined and directly align with the grant objectives, providing clear metrics for evaluating success. Additionally, the milestones set forth are ambitious yet realistic, with a clear roadmap for achieving them over the 12-week grant period. Overall, Factor's incentive strategy appears robust and well-thought-out, making it a compelling proposal for acceptance.\n*GFX Feedback) *\nOur main concern with this grant plan is requesting an amount that is nearly as much as the entire protocol\u2019s TVL.

The upgrade focuses on changing how the quorum threshold is computed such that it is a fixed percentage of the total Delegated Voting Power (DVP), impacting the quorum threshold for constitutional and non-constitutional proposals.\n\nThrough this temperature check, we aim to collect community sentiment on DVP Quorum. The exact parameters of the system will be confirmed through a separate Snapshot closer to the on-chain proposal. This will give the community more time to discuss the parameters and allow OCL to start working on the implementation in parallel.\n\n## Motivation & Rationale\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO has been struggling to achieve quorum on constitutional proposals. The gap between participation and quorum has been shrinking and has now become alarmingly low.If no tokens are excluded from voting, quorum currently increases at 36M ARB/year for non-constitutional proposals, and 54M ARB/year for constitutional proposals. It will soon reach a point where active voting power available is no longer greater than quorum, bringing the DAO to a standstill. This proposal aims to avoid such a scenario and provide a long term fix to ArbitrumDAO\u2019s quorum issues.\n\nThe situation at hand is fueled by two fundamental issues. Firstly, quorum is computed based on the total voteable supply which has no relationship to the tokens registered to vote. Secondly, delegated voting power has remained relatively unchanged over time. Together, this has led to a scenario where the quorum threshold is increasing, but the total voting power is steady. This proposal focuses on addressing the first issue by redefining the quorum computation logic. Increasing DVP is a separate endeavour that should be pursued to further strengthen Arbitrum governance.\n\nKindly refer to this recently published [research report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dvp-quorum-for-arbitrumdao/29996) and [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/_amanwithwings/arb-dao-quorum) that explores the current situation in greater detail. The report supports moving to a DVP-based quorum model as it has several advantages including alignment with voter registration and not requiring token holders to actively exclude their votes from the votable supply. A DVP-based solution also preserves the fundamental properties of the existing voting system such as one token one vote and the ability for an external party to easily evaluate whether quorum has been reached.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Proposed Quorum Model\n\nThis proposal seeks to replace the current voteable-supply-based quorum definition with a Delegated Voting Power (DVP)-based definition:\n\n`Quorum = max (\u0251*DVP, baseline quorum), where \u0251 and baseline quorum are constants`\n* \u0251 will have different values for non-constitutional and constitutional proposals\n* Similarly, baseline quorum will be different for non-constitutional and constitutional proposals\n\nThe formula ensures that quorum varies as a fixed percentage of DVP (\u0251*DVP), unless the baseline quorum is greater. The graph below shows how quorum would change with DVP if we choose an \u0251 value of 0.5 and a baseline quorum of 150M ARB.\n\n![1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hyea6Cmpxg.png)\n\n\nThis [research report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dvp-quorum-for-arbitrumdao/29996) recommends choosing an \u0251 value in the [0.4, 0.5] range with non-constitutional and constitutional quorum tending towards the lower and upper end of that range respectively. The report suggests 100M ARB as the baseline quorum value for non-constitutional proposals and 150M as the baseline quorum value for constitutional proposals. However, we will refrain from asking the DAO to vote on the exact quorum parameters at this stage. Parameters will be confirmed through a separate Snapshot closer to the on-chain proposal so that the community has more time to inform its decision.\n\nTo implement the proposed solution, the following smart-contract level changes need to be made:\n\n1. The $ARB token contract needs to be upgraded to keep a running total that is updated on each delegation change and token transfer.\n2. The DAO governor contracts need to be upgraded to use the new total DVP metric. Existing calculations need to be replaced with DVP-based thresholds.\n\nOffchain Labs will be taking on the development and testing of the proposed upgrades. An untested, unaudited PoC of the token contract upgrade can be found [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/compare/d13b123...c18ff53fbb).\n\n## Voting Options\n\nThrough this temperature check, we aim to collect community sentiment on DVP Quorum. The proposal will include the following voting options:\n\n* For DVP Quorum\n* Against DVP Quorum\n* Abstain\n\nShould *For DVP Quorum* be the majority preference, OCL will begin work on the implementation, including production-ready code and the necessary audits. The exact parameters of the DVP Quorum model (\u0251 and baseline quorum values) will be determined through a separate Snapshot closer to the on-chain proposal.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "e5d161b8-3b96-435c-9a9a-73e4c6739695", "proposal_id": "5d08e275-600b-4338-ab90-dda89a4c0bff", "snapshot_id": "0x5e43fdcaa085476a7be4fb638dd57f7b3f6b708fbbbe1380e54da126c7a095d2", "title": "Proposal: Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit", "author_name": "0xA5dF0cf3F95C6cd97d998b9D990a86864095d9b0", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5e43fdcaa085476a7be4fb638dd57f7b3f6b708fbbbe1380e54da126c7a095d2", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-07-21 18:49:27", "voting_end": "2023-07-28 18:49:27", "options": {"scores": [83105069.84913562, 349955.1739001044, 94342.99417016088], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-07-28 18:49:27", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.717", "body": "Category: Constitutional - Process\n\nHigh Level Overview\nThe ArbitrumDAO Constitution specifies that the first Security Council election should start on the 15th September alongside a specification for the election.\n\nAn on-chain implementation of the entire election is still a work in progress. The Arbitrum Foundation has sponsored the implementation of a smart contract suite by Offchain Labs, an extension of Tally\u2019s user interface, and the respective audits.\n\nThis proposal seeks to revise the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to provide flexibility for the start date of the election. If passed by a Constitutional Vote, the new start date will be on the 15th September or the earliest possible date in which an on-chain election can begin.\n\nThe motivation to change the election\u2019s start date is to provide time for the implementation to be completed, security audits to be performed, for the community to gain confidence in the quality of its implementation and for the Arbitrum DAO to vote on a separate Constitutional AIP to install an on-chain election system.\n\nThe overarching goal is to still allow the election to begin on the 15th September, but it is prudent to provide leeway and ensure all parties, especially the Arbitrum DAO, are confident in the election software\u2019s security and completeness.\n\nPath to a Smart Contract Enabled Election\nThis proposal seeks approval from the Arbitrum DAO that the first and all subsequent security elections should be performed via the on-chain election process.\n\nThe activation of the Security Council election is dependent on:\n\nComplete implementation for the on-chain smart contracts,\nComplete implementation of the user interface,\nSmart contract audit by a highly regarded auditing firm,\nAll parties, including the Arbitrum DAO, have gained confidence in the implementation\u2019s completeness and security,\nSuccessful Constitutional Vote by the DAO to install the new election software.\nA vote on this proposal is approving that the above conditions are mandatory for any election software before it can be installed into the on-chain smart contracts.\n\nModified Start Date for Election\nThe implementation sponsored by the Arbitrum Foundation should be ready for the start date of the 15th September.\n\nEven so, given the naunces of implementation details and the potential security risks to a critical part of the system, we believe it is still prudent to provide leeway and extra time for the Security Council elections to begin some time after the required date set out by The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nAfter all, it is not just about having a complete implementation, but ensuring all parties have confidence that all efforts have made been to minimize the risk of bugs in the implementation.\n\nRevision to ArbitrumDAO Constitution\nThe revised text focuses on the election beginning at the earliest possible date from the 15th September. Additionally, the election can only begin once an on-chain election system is installed via a separate Constitutional Vote.\n\nAll future elections can begin exactly six months after the previous election. As such, the chosen date for the first election will decide the earliest start date for the next election.\n\nFor extra clarity in the text, we have renamed \u201cSeptember Cohort\u201d to \u201cFirst Cohort\u201d and \u201cMarch Cohort\u201d to \u201cSecond Cohort\u201d\n\nFinally, to remove any ambiguity, all security council members are expected to serve the time until the new Security Council members are installed in the respective smart contracts.\n\nCurrent text of ArbitrumDAO Constitution:\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into a September Cohort of 6 members, and a March Cohort of 6 members. Every year on September 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 September Cohort seats; and every year on March 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 March Cohort seats.\n\nThis means that the initial September Cohort will serve an initial term of 6 months, whereas the initial March Cohort will serve an initial term of 1 year.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the September Cohort and 6 members in the March Cohort. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report here.\n\nProposed Revision of Arbitrum Constitution:\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the \u2018First Cohort\u2019 and 6 members in the \u2018Second Cohort\u2019. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report here.\n\nThe first security election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date.

The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThis proposal represents an improved version compared to previous initiatives and requests for comments (RFCs):\n\n- [[RFC-2] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-2-delegate-incentive-system-for-arbitrumdao/15720)\n- [[DRAFT] Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/draft-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/16501)\n\nWe have developed this new proposal considering the comments and observations provided by other delegates. Our additional motivation lies in the recent increase in proposals and increased activity within ArbitrumDAO. We believe that delegates are the core base of the DAO and should be properly incentivized to maintain active participation, both in voting and feedback on proposals and in the ideation of governance processes.\n\n# **Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## **Before reading the proposal, note how we have decided to structure it**\n\nThis proposal is structured into four main sections:\n\n* **Option 1:** This is our main proposal detailing all the specifications of the incentive system.\n* **Option 2:** Introduces the implementation of \"Karma\" to automate certain processes. It's important to note that this option entails additional costs.\n* **General Summary:** An overview of the proposed items.\n* **Next Steps:** Voting deadline\n\n# **Option 1 - Main Proposal**\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number at **50 delegates**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a reasonable starting point.\n\n## Funding\n\n- Incentives for delegates: 1,500,000 ARB\n- Incentive Program Administrator: 25,000 ARB\n\n## Delegate Selection Process\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\n> * So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\n> * The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\n> * Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:\n> 1.

They must post using the template provided below, within a 7-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\n> * Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid on a monthly basis, we will use a point system and a framework that will be made public.\n\n![scores.png](ipfs://bafybeieuu4yypwmkapdkznz4arvsci7t7ond4a7qh55us2fuz5ijjbhwsa)\n    \n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. This parameter is extracted from Tally. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR * 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Tn) /SV(Fn)) * 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Fn) - TV(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Fn) - CR(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Fn) - CP(Rn)) * 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 * TP% / 100))**\n\n#### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting on Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum\u2019s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n- Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n- Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n- Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n- Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n- Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no? \n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Delegate Responsibilities\n\nDelegates are responsible for keeping track of their actions. At the end of the month, they have until the 3rd of the following month to submit a forum post with the following requirements:\n\n* A copy (Link) of the framework with their activity data for that month.\n* Additionally, the post must have a summary with all the links including:\n  * Snapshot voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the reasoning behind the snapshot vote\n  * Tally voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the tally vote reasoning (if you have changed your vote)\n  * Commenting on Proposals link (only those that went to snapshots)\n* The summary should also include:\n  * Delegate proposal links\n  * Links to any significant contribution (discussion, questions, suggestions, etc.) made to a proposal.\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Delegates failing to post the requested information will not receive incentives.\n> * To avoid forum spam and disarray, we will ask the facilitators to add a channel for the incentive system so delegates can input all their information there.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nAfter the delegates post and present their results in the framework, the incentive system administrator has 10 days to gather all the information, review, verify, and unify it. Then, present all the unified data on the forum in the [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862) and attach a summary explaining that month's final result.\n\nOnce the final result is presented, delegates have 2 days to file a claim in case of disagreement.\n\n#### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success. \n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be sent as a proposal to Tally, with full details of the payments, between the 16th and 17th. This will be repeated for the 6 months, so that the DAO has control over the incentive program and can cut it off whenever it wants.\n\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\nEstimated schedule:\n\n![schedule.png](ipfs://bafkreie7nlxyh7jx7myxgfj6eqogu6p7kfebmokq3v5fvxzskmmb7j2h64)\n    \n### Administrator Perspective\n\n1. Start of the month: Track delegate participation in governance.\n2. Last day of the month: Begin collecting delegate posts from the forum.\n3. Review all the information, check for accuracy, and compile it into the framework.\n4. Establish the results within the given timeframe.\n5. If everyone agrees, send a proposal to Tally with the payment details, to be voted on.\n6. Keep the DAO informed\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the adminstration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the adminstration of said program the budget would be 25,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator.\n\n---\n\n# **Option 2 - Karma automation for delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n**Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates\u2019 forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n- **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n- **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n- **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n- **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n- **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n- **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n- **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n### Cost\n\n- 30000 ARB\n\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nAs with Option 1, we are also open to having a group of delegates or potentially a third party administer Karma's progress and the program, in which case we would obviously provide all necessary assistance.\n\nFor the administration of the program for this option the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator. \n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\nProposal overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates.

If approved by the DAO, they will not retroactively apply to the current AGV Council.\n\nAdditionally, these changes will be fully funded within AGV\u2019s existing operating budget and require no additional DAO funds.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe AGV Council provides sustained oversight of a program deploying 200m ARB in capital. Council members review investment strategies, guide strategic alignment within the Arbitrum ecosystem, and help maintain the integrity of AGV\u2019s operations and budgets. \n\nCurrently, AGV Council members are compensated at rates that are below average when compared to comparable advisory and portfolio-oversight positions across DAO, venture, and corporate board ecosystems. \n\nFor detailed market comparisons that informed these compensation levels, see the table below: \n\n#### Table A: Industry & VC Compensation Benchmarks.\n\n| Role Type | Scope & Repsponsibility | Typical Annual Compensation | Structure | Benchamark Source |\n|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Corporate Board Members | Strategic oversight, quarterly meetings, minimal operational role | $45K \u2013 $90K | USD stipend + occasional equity | NACD, Spencer Stuart |\n| Board Advisors | Subject-matter expertise, low time commitment, very early stage startups | $30K \u2013 $60K | Cash + small equity grant (0.1\u20130.25%) | PwC, Deloitte |\n| Startup Advisors (Seed\u2013A) | Hands-on product, GTM, or domain guidance for early-stage companies | $20K \u2013 $50K | Cash or 0.25\u20131% equity, 2\u20134 year vest (rarely becomes liquid) | Carta, AngelList |\n| OATs | Independent oversight, reporting accuracy, compliance checks, covers many initiatives, up to 10h a week commitment, diverse responsibility | \\~$90K USD + 100k ARB (\\~$50k) = $140K Total | The bonus payment is vested, with funds released after a 24-month cliff following the term\u2019s end | Arbitrum OAT |\n| *Current AGV Council* | *Provide oversight and input program performance, operations, and DAO transparency* | *$30k ($80k for IC member)* | *USD annualized base compensation* | *AGV* |\n\nThis forward-looking adjustment will increase the annualized base salary of each Council member by $20,000 USD, plus grant each member a bonus of 60,000 ARB tokens, vested on an accelerated 6-month schedule following the Council term. \n\nAdjusting Council compensation in this way will set a sustainable baseline for future Council service, while the inclusion of a bonus denominated in ARB tokens directly aligns Council\u2019s contributions with the long-term health and growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, incentivizing responsible and effective oversight and input.  \n\n## Process, Implementation & Next Steps\n\nThe AGV team, in carrying out its responsibilities under the [Foundation Bylaws](https://arbitrumgamingventures.com/governance) to manage general and administrative matters of the GCP Program, including finance and human resources, prepared this proposal using industry and compensation benchmarks identified in Table A (above). The proposal was presented to the Council, which provided key input but recused itself from the decision-making process to avoid any conflict of interest. The Foundation Director has reviewed and approved the proposal in its current form.\nIn order to seek tokenholder approval on financial discrepancies between the original GCP Proposal and this proposal, the AGV team and Council now submit this proposal for a DAO vote.\n\nIf the proposal passes:\n* The new compensation framework will take effect with the start of the next AGV Council term.\n\n##\u00a0Timeline\n\n* The proposal was [resubmitted to the forum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-agv-council-compensation-calibration-benchmark-for-next-term-startup-phase-bonus/29424/12?u=arbitrumgaming) on 2nd October 2025.\n* The previous vote [scheduled on 9th October](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-agv-council-compensation-calibration-benchmark-for-next-term-startup-phase-bonus/29424/14?u=arbitrumgaming) has been [removed from Snapshot](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-agv-council-compensation-calibration-benchmark-for-next-term-startup-phase-bonus/29424/23?u=arbitrumgaming).\n* Proposal A (Benchmark Calibration for Future Council Members) will be posted to Snapshot voting on Thursday, 16th October.\n* Proposal B (Startup-Phase Bonus for Current Council Members) will follow at some point after Proposal A.\n\n## Voting Options\n\nThis proposal will include the following voting options:\n- For \n- Against \n- Abstain\n\nShould FOR be the majority preference, and the combined FOR and ABSTAIN votes meet at least 3% of the total votable ARB supply, the proposal will be considered approved and may proceed to implementation.", "match_confidence": 0.7195, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "e888625a-af2e-417f-b20d-580de256dc8a", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x47d78e0fcac0ad664516c7bae6dc93a15d3ed15dfff96b1ab5ab6637dc680d18", "title": "LODESTAR FINANCE STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x47d78e0fcac0ad664516c7bae6dc93a15d3ed15dfff96b1ab5ab6637dc680d18", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [183705825.25445068, 4607531.764876813, 3360029.232199982], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.448", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

It\u2019s unclear how many users will want to connect an Arbitrum address to banking services, but the structure of the connection (via NFT) and the nature of payment services suggest any users will be extremely sticky to Arbitrum as a chain.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nSafepal\u2019s grant proposal introduces an innovative strategy for linking Arbitrum with traditional banking services. While the potential demand for connecting an Arbitrum address to banking remains uncertain, this approach creatively enhances ecosystem engagement by leveraging payment rails and banking facilities. Although we have reservations about the $20 CPA, this initiative presents an opportunity for experimentation to assess its viability on Arbitrum. If successful, it could serve as a model for collaboration with other wallet providers and payment rails in the future.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nSafePal provided a thorough justification for the grant size along with clear milestones, KPIs, and a solid distribution strategy. We ranked them high on sybil resistance due to the requirement of a banking KYC. The SafePal banking gateway and Visa card product is novel and an exciting addition to the Arbitrum ecosystem that we believe will bring in new users. \n\nSome additional points for improvement, there was a lot of duplicated content and several details could have been more concise.

Buffer employs an AMM-based model similar to GMX, where the Buffer Liquidity Pool (BLP) facilitates market-making for exotic options trading. Buffer runs on a similar AMM based model as GMX - where the BLP (Buffer Liquidity Pool) provides market-making liquidity for exotic options trading.\n\nFollowing our September 2023 launch of Buffer v2.5, we implemented stringent risk management strategies\u2014including tighter open interest caps and spreads\u2014to maintain positive expectancy for the AMMs and safeguard LP interests (a trajectory similar to that of GMX and GMX v2). During this time, due to market fluctuations and competitor activities influenced our trading volume and performance, leading to weeks of lower averages post-launch.\n\nRecently, we initiated the Bull vs Bear Trading Competition, which, coupled with a relaxation of our conservative risk management policies, has reignited interest and activity within the protocol. Currently, the daily volume averages over 16,000 USDC.\n\n![|602x336](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xm8sr2SroZFuymX2xfpEQOzgwuuWOB2Kwow8YMfyoqnCtRU99PUGUkogECU_tO_k80MAz6sQnwJNtqguEZ5iRO4j3M7lJ6Nv8w_6SDyXIbCluxxP5QHQX7inIxp3gFAjKw4am7AIkRssIAeZY3Li09Q)\n\nBull vs Bear Competition Summary (the campaign is still ongoing, we are 3 weeks into it):\n\n* Week 1\n\n![|602x121](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/W8ibCJeyFsz3XboMrNXn2Mob4CBU-9GjBOHx1tKi9sXa052xZS6UdsrzKo11Rlw0XN_YuOsqoKnHBuTQTtKnhDbZ6OSa9PtnojCMODhS5TrrbaA0UBkSgj6-2SbitXTo_7lmotBEb0nI9m_gBxLKY6o)\n\n* Week 2:\n\n![|602x115](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jWI8M8tG1qEKmWDf-sntfQ8DD30WI5t8cKFOl9ev_B-c2ZKAPqKXAXFvWZV8KrVoW4a24QhC43AQEqOA2fzbdKgne0aZ78xiz8y84-HlOoXAxk3oDF5nqkMoChJ6kAxwkpEvMBDRjKZtUT8094CoFu4)\n\n* Week 3:\n\n![|602x123](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qLx_VF4eKGaU80_LNfLNqOSO7izfe_ynltaTKvgid3cKajdqstaZLK8A36VlnczyMdJmVNCG1peLIaBmy3VPxwkURiYuN29sF5NYwmJYShvmwxUKJsg7BqNGbwtR5FT_IM1NtXph94aYDnmNvjiTeSo)\n\nAll competition related metrics can be found here:\n\nhttps://app.buffer.finance/#/leaderboard/galxe\n\nDashboard shows a significant uptick in trading volume as well as returning users: https://app.buffer.finance/#/dashboard || https://stats.buffer.finance/\n\n* Measures to prevent Wash Trading:\n\nBuffer\u2019s League based competition makes gaming the system incredibly difficult. The competition is designed to reward consistent, ongoing performance instead of a single one-time score.\n\nPending rewards are accumulated based on rank on the leaderboard. Total rewards for each rank are calculated based on a geometric sequence - to ensure that each position on the leaderboard earns more than the place below it, rather than grouping leaderboard standings into equal reward buckets.\n\nTrading leagues will have a cap on incentives based on fees earned to prevent any wash trading \u2013 this is further prevented by being focused on PnL, although volume may play a factor.\n\n* Accountability and Implementation:\n\nOn top of our [Dashboard](https://app.buffer.finance/#/leaderboard/galxe?week=3) and [Stats](https://stats.buffer.finance/arbitrum) page, we set up Dune Dashboards for tracking metrics around the initiatives. We will commit to regular updates around the protocol performance, especially around metrics including:\n\n* BLP TVL\n* Trading Volume\n* Trading Fee Generated\n* User growth and retention\n* Effective prevention of wash trading around competitions.\n\n* Details on Social Features:\n\nAs the new incentive layer unfolds on Buffer, we will introduce several features to increase stickiness and drive trading activity:\n\n1. Revamped Optopi Collection: Optopi is a collection of 8,888 unique PFP friendly NFTs on Arbitrum offering key utilities to traders. We plan to revamp the Optopi utility to offer exclusive features including: exclusive access to trading leagues (higher tier in trading leagues), discounts while buying payout boosts.\n\n2. Chatting rooms: allowing users to engage directly with other users on the platform who are interested in that community or page.\n\n3. Trading Challenges: allowing traders to engage into battle royale-styled PvP challenges to facilitate user onboarding and community building.\n\n4. Low risk PVP trading: play tokens or virtual tokens that allow traders to trade risk free on Buffer.\n\n5. Social Trading: enable social trading, allowing users to follow and replicate top performing traders on Buffer.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "eac4a805-ccc9-4690-8bc6-ec24e5dd2e60", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xa2086c2996ab0967b3f083bbdfd53591dc2f491c86eed5c8e452e2f8d60af9e1", "title": "Copra LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0xAD16ebE6FfC7d96624A380F394cD64395B0C6144", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xa2086c2996ab0967b3f083bbdfd53591dc2f491c86eed5c8e452e2f8d60af9e1", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [139943127.2699816, 74445.10705253342, 467926.8411313192], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.611", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/copra-ltipp-application-draft/21628\n\n## Council - 3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nCopra\u2019s gated usage has made it difficult to judge the traction of their product and while we scored it average, there product is unique and the overall execution plan was properly detailed.

Steakhouse Financial won the vote with 60% in favor of their selection, with fees of $174,000 quoted in their application. \n\nThe Tally proposal in April 2024 listed 100k ARB as program management costs, which converted to $86,581 in June-July 2024 by the Arbitrum Foundation. This is insufficient to cover one year of Steakhouse Financials fees. Note: even if the ARB price had gone up, they would not have earned more - all applicant fees were quoted in dollar value and not ARB.\n\nThis proposal seeks input on the right way forward, with the options to\n- Approve only a 6 month contract from available funds\n- Earmark additional funds from yield earned so they complete the one year tenure\n- Not have a program manager, which will result in liquidation of the RWAs\n- Conduct a new RFP to select a program manager for one year at $86,581\n- Abstain\n\n**Motivation** \n\nOn April 10th 2024, the DAO approved 35 million ARB for diversification into RWAs. Of this, 100,000 ARB was budgeted for the role of program manager. The Arbitrum Foundation got an average price of 87 cents per ARB, resulting in $86,581 to pay the program manager.\n\n \n![2024-09-12 23.22.46.jpg](ipfs://bafkreicuaeyplf7wz2ayqzy33iailoxby5zohrg4gngmda4h5q3ja5otei)\n    \n\nIn June 2024, applications for the program manager role opened up where all applicants listed their fees in dollars. Given the funds received from the 100,000 ARB sale ($86,531) are less than the amount necessary to pay the $174,000 listed in Steakhouse Financials application, we need to either shorten their term to 6 months or approve an additional 6 months pay (from yield earned via the program). We can also declare the earlier election null and void while putting out a call for program managers willing to serve at $86,581 for a year. If there is no program manager to oversee investments, assets are liquidated and returned to the DAO.\n\n**Rationale** \n\nWhile writing the Tally proposal, 100k ARB was budgeted for the program manager role based on a sample quotation received from another provider and the prevailing ARB price at the time.\n\nSteakhouse financial and the other applicants prepared their budget in dollar value based on the sample provided instead of in ARB. As a result, the program manager role in the STEP program became under-budgeted and now needs approval from the DAO on provisioning either a shortened tenure of 6 months or additional funding to complete the one year. The additional funds will be requested from the yield earned on the RWAs (estimated at between $1-2 million per year) to prevent ARB liquidations. Alternatively, we can hold a new RFP seeking program managers at a fixed price of $86,581 for the year and invalidate the earlier election.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe STEP program is one of the largest diversification initiatives at any DAO, seeking to diversify our treasury while simultaneously growing the RWA ecosystem. Given the complications that can arise in managing the large sums of money, it is imperative that the DAO have a capable program manager to recommend liquidations ,conduct firedrills, monitor interest payments to the DAO treasury, and track underlying changes in service providers.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nAfter ratification of Steakhouse Financials role as STEP program manager and whether it is 6 months or 1 year, the Arbitrum foundation will sign an agreement with Steakhouse Financial and begin investments into selected RWA providers.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n\nPost on forum\n\nUpload on Snapshot (Thursday, 12th September)\n\nFoundation negotiates agreement with Steakhouse and pays the first 6 months of their payment from the initial 100,000 ARB budgeted for in the STEP proposal\n\nAfter RWA yield is returned to the treasury, this proposal is taken to Tally requesting balance of $87,419 (provided one year tenure is approved in the snapshot)\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nIf the entire one year tenure is ratified, the cost to the DAO is $87,419 paid via yield earned from the program. If 6 month tenure is approved, the cost is needing another election for program manager in a shortened time. If the proposal is rejected, we liquidate all $30 million and return assets to the DAO. If a new RFP is held seeking program manager services for $86,581 for a year, we delay the start of the STEP program and possibly get a less capable pool of applicants at the lower price point.\n\nThere is no budget required for work done on this proposal as it has been paid for through a Thrivecoin ThankArbitrum firestarter grant to the treasury and sustainability working group", "match_confidence": 0.8, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "edc63b8b-6f3a-4dfc-a2ec-d03c2860b44e", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x8a511e833021b64d63bf518eb9ff447216d83dac9235243f3a139f699d1f98ee", "title": "OpenOcean STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8a511e833021b64d63bf518eb9ff447216d83dac9235243f3a139f699d1f98ee", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [166663978.983853, 11172500.093932068, 9867636.371692048], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.487", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

Specifically, the Hackathon Continuation Program is currently underfunded by $89,980 USD due to token price drop before RnDAO received any funds.\n\nBeyond usual market risks, the program faced prolonged market risks due to delays as we worked with the Arbitrum Foundation on an improved fund management system for DAO-led investments, creating a valuable process template for the Arbitrum ecosystem, but exposing us to this situation.\n\nThis proposal suggests using a portion of the Domain Allocator (i.e. Questbook grant program) funds left over from the season 1 (a bit over $200k, due to be returned to the DAO) to \u201ctop up\u201d the Hackathon Continuation Program and allow it to continue as approved by the DAO.\n\nWe\u2019ll also propose an option in the vote for the remaining funds from the Domain Allocator season 1, to be sent to the Treasury Management Committee to increase their stablecoin pool. Said pool could be used by service providers in the future to cover shortfalls as per a process to be designed by the TMC ([see their first draft here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tmc-stablecoin-withdrawal-process/28877)).\n\n# [](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-consitutional-top-up-for-hackathon-continuation-program/29064#p-69807-rationale-2)Rationale\n\nWhat\u2019s the current status and why did the shortfall happen?  \nThe Hackathon Continuation Program is divided into two phases, with separate payments for each. The MSS holds enough funds to complete payments for projects in Phase 1 of the program and has some USDC remaining for Phase 2 but not enough to complete the program.\n\nThe complexity of this specific initiative (the first investment program setup via the DAO) meant we needed to figure out a system for fund management for investments. The initial approach proposed would have required additional bureaucracy (register RnDAO signers and the RnDAO multisig setup for project investments as part of the AF) and so, in cooperation with the Foundation, we devised an improved approach that would see RnDAO scheduling payments directly on the MSS while the MSS signers would approve payments.\n\nThe system devised can be used moving forward to facilitate future investment programs, unlocking a valuable milestone for the DAO to test investments and improve the ROI of ecosystem development programs. However, the money requested was to be paid in stables, and the conversion didn\u2019t happen immediately.  \nSeeing the market drop, in coordination with the AF, RnDAO tried to delay the swapping of funds as long as possible to allow for a market recovery; unfortunately, the price didn\u2019t recover in time, and it was required to swap at a reduced token price to meet the program obligations for Phase 1. Leading to a budget shortfall for Phase 2.\n\nAdvancing the program is time-sensitive, as the projects are now expecting the funding and support to progress. Any further delays could cause them to fail or migrate to other ecosystems.\n\n**Is this a precedent?**\n\nThe funds left over from Season 1 of the Domain Allocator programs are due to be returned to the DAO. Authorising a transfer to the MSS for usage in the Hackathon Continuation Program (HCP) (while the rest of the funds are sent to the DAO/AF) would be a one-time action that would provide timely reassurance to the HCP projects. Given that the rest of the funds would be returned, this approach would not become a recurring mechanism in the DAO.\n\n**What about the Domain Allocator programs?**\n\nBoth programs follow the same objective of supporting builders in Arbitrum.\n\nThe approach proposed in this proposal was suggested by [@jojo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo) as a viable route, given the small sums needed and the availability of the funds.\n\n**What about the Treasury Management Committee and the checking account?**\n\nThe TMC V 1.2 proposal sets $ 15 million USD equivalent to be converted to Stables and serve as a reserve for service providers. The TMC has proposed a mechanism based on using the yield of this reserve, which will take time to accrue. As such, the proposed strategy can cover a short-term gap in the proposed mechanism.\n\n**Calculation of the exact amount:**\n\nAs per the AF post ([Hackathon Continuation Program - #149 by Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/hackathon-continuation-program/27492/149)), 2 Arb were left after Phase 1.

(He will post soon, but just sharing here for clarity to all)\n\nWe have reduced our ask to 2m ARB and made other core changes to the Proposal to align with council and delegate feedback.\n\n* Synthetix LTIP Proposal:[ https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023)\n\nWe want to highlight that while our advisors provided valuable guidance, there was a discrepancy between the advisor and LTIP councilor feedback. Had we received the council feedback earlier, we would have promptly made the necessary adjustments to align with the council\u2019s expectations.\n\nBecause of this discrepancy, we feel it is essential for delegates to reconsider the Synthetix LTIP proposal with the following edits:\n\n**Summary of feedback from Councillors/Delegates:**\n\n**1. Grant Size:**\n\n* The requested grant size of 4.5 million ARB is notably large, and it may take a long time for Arbitrum to recoup the benefit.\n* The grant size could potentially crowd out other grants to projects with fewer resources than Synthetix.\n\n**2. Incentive Design and Justification:**\n\n* More details are needed on the proposed trading competition and its contribution to the sybil resistance/wash trading score.\n* The Proposal lacks clarity in justifying the requested grant size and outlining a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy.\n* The Proposal would benefit from more concrete evidence and data supporting the expected impact on trading activity, liquidity, and user adoption within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n**3. Long-term Alignment with Arbitrum:**\n\n* Given Synthetix\u2019s planned chain as part of the OP Superchain, there is a risk that the Proposal may, in the long term, draw users/liquidity/etc. outside of Arbitrum and be detrimental to the broader Arbitrum market.\n\n**4. Collaboration and Ecosystem Integration:**\n\n* More detail is desired on the proposed candidates for collaboration partnerships with other Arbitrum proposals.\n\n**TLDR Changes**\n\n* Total grant request reduced from 4,500,000 ARB to 2,000,000 ARB\n* Grant breakdown updated:\n  * 1,000,000 ARB for LP incentives (reduced from 1,600,000 ARB)\n  * 900,000 ARB for trading fee rebates (reduced from 1,800,000 ARB)\n  * 100,000 ARB for stablecoin liquidity (reduced from 500,000 ARB)\n  * Removed 600,000 ARB allocation for trading competitions and growth experiments\n* Incentives distribution timeline updated:\n  * LP incentives will be utilized throughout the entire three months, with an initial ramp-up period during the first month, to ensure there is proper liquidity to support open interest once Perps trading scales up.\n  * Stablecoin liquidity incentives & trading/growth incentives will be the focus of the second and third months\n* Milestones updated (scaled down due to reductions in grant sizing):\n  * Week 1-4: Reach 30m in LP collateral\n  * Week 4-8: Reach 5m in stablecoin liquidity\n  * Week 8-16: Achieve 5b in cumulative trading volume\n\n**Detailed Responses to feedback and Changes:**\n\n1. Grant Size and Allocation:\n\n* We have reduced the total grant request from 4.5 million ARB to 2 million ARB to better align with the LTIP Council & Delegate Feedback. This better aligns our proposal with the sizing in LTIP, and will provide valuable incentives to scale up Synthetix on Arbitrum.\n\n2. The revised grant breakdown is as follows:\n\n* 1,000,000 ARB for LP incentives\n* 900,000 ARB for trading fee rebates\n* 100,000 ARB for stablecoin liquidity\n\n2. Justification for Grant Allocation:\n\n**1. 1,000,000 ARB for LP Incentives:**\n\n* This allocation will enable us to achieve a critical mass of LP collateral, supporting the following collateral growth over a 3-month period (excluding trading fee rewards) - We\u2019ve added this information from the request of the CounciCouncil * 20% APY: $27.3 million TVL\n  * 15% APY: $36.4 million TVL\n  * 10% APY: $54.5 million TVL\n  * 5% APY: $109.1 million TVL\n* A critical mass of LP collateral is essential to underwrite Perps Markets. Each $1 of liquidity provider capital allows Synthetix Perps to support $4 of major cryptocurrency open interest or $2 of longer-tail cryptocurrencies. This allocation will enable us to support approximately $70-100 million in OI caps, catering to whale traders and those transitioning from CEXs.\n\n**2. 900,000 ARB for Trading Fee Rebates:**\n\n* Capped at 75% of fees paid for users, this allocation serves two key purposes:\n  * Incentivize users to trade on Synthetix on Arbitrum for the first time, helping to market the product, onboard new traders, and ease them into our ecosystem.\n  * Incentivize LPs backing these markets, as they will receive a majority of the rewards.\n  * Based on the estimated fees rebated at 3-6bp and an ARB price of $1.10, the 900,000 ARB allocated for trading fee rebates translates to approximately $2.7-5.5 billion in fully rebated volume.\n\n**3. 100,000 ARB for sUSD Incentives:**\n\n* sUSD is a core component of our Proposal. Users can deposit LP collateral, delegate it to Perps V3 markets to underwrite trading and earn fees, and mint sUSD to pre-borrow against their trading fees. Ensuring deep liquidity for sUSD is critical to support this functionality and enhance capital efficiency.\n* At 10% APY, the 100,000 ARB allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $6 million.\n* At 15% APY, the allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $4 million.\n* At 20% APY, the allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $3 million.\n\n3. Long-term Alignment with Arbitrum:\n\n* We understand the concerns regarding the potential impact of our planned OP Superchain on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Before anything else, we\u2019d like to clarify that we see Arbitrum as a critical path of growth for Synthetix, and DeFi Derivatives as a whole. It has been the home of almost all onchain DEX Perps protocols, and we are excited to offer traders and LPs Synthetix V3 as another trading option. Additionally, we propose the following:\n* We will prioritize the growth and development of Synthetix on Arbitrum, focusing on driving users, liquidity, and activity to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n  * It is also critical to note that the Synthetix deployment on Arbitrum is exclusive in its usage of an Arbitrum native stablecoin to increase system capital efficiency, support for additional assets outside of USDC (like Ethena sUSDe/USDe), and existing integrators ready to support this deployment.\n* We will work closely with the Arbitrum community and other projects to foster collaborations and integrations that benefit the entire ecosystem. There are ample opportunities for existing players, and due to the composable nature of Synthetix V3, we are excited to utilize these to increase the usage of Synthetix for Arbitrum native users.\n  * We\u2019ve already passed a proposal with Ethena to support their stablecoin as collateral, and intend to onboard many more Arbitrum native assets as collateral types.\n* Clarify that Synthetix does not intend to bridge users to another chain through this program. We see a critical pathway to grow on Arbitrum as a home for DeFi Perps, and we intend to grow alongside the chain to grow onchain DEX Perps on Arbitrum.\n\n4. Collaboration and Ecosystem Integration:\n\n* We have identified several potential candidates for integration/asset support partnerships with projects on Arbitrum. These including existing ecosystem partners - Kwenta, Polynomial, Rage Trade, Infinex, and more.\n  * Additionally, at the asset level, Synthetix V3 can support any collateral type with an onchain oracle. Governance has already approved sUSDe/USDe as collateral on the platform and DAI/USDC/ETH/ARB.\n  * In the future, we intend to support yield-generating collateral types to increase the amount of composability, this will include (subject to governance) Lending Tokens (aave, comp, etc), sDAI from MakerDAO, LRT\u2019s, LST\u2019s, BTC on Arbitrum, and so on. We\u2019ve listed this on our Proposal as well.\n\n5.

Through ARB staking, token holders who delegate to active governance participants will be able to capture value. The proposal will also implement a liquid staked ARB token (stARB) via the Tally Protocol that enables any future rewards to auto-compound, is (re)stakeable, and is compatible with DeFi. Separately, we will work with the Arbitrum DAO to decide whether and how to fund rewards and split rewards between token holders and delegates.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe ARB token is struggling to accrue value.\n\n* Governance power is the only source of fundamental demand for ARB, while there are multiple sources of new supply (unlocks, treasury spending).\n* The ability to restake ARB or use it on DeFi is not compatible with governance. Voting power breaks when ARB is deposited into smart contracts. [Less than 1%](https://dune.com/queries/3732998/6278607) of ARB tokens are used actively in the onchain ecosystem.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihwhaicuuh3c7t3zvpe3xtqy3djrcp3jrqwslcxu4bpzhcvf2iwmu)\n    \nThe ARB token is struggling as a governance mechanism\n\n* Only about 10% of the circulating supply of ARB is [actively used](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates) in governance\n* Voter participation in the DAO has been [steadily declining](https://dune.com/queries/3829223/6440489) since DAO launch\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidgp7nukhkti7w65mntaqfztqr6wrefiwfry7tgiuwhgqokyg36t4)\n    \nMeanwhile, the Arbitrum DAO treasury has accumulated over [16 Million $ETH](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury) in surplus fees from Arbitrum One and Nova. As a result, it is becoming economically attractive for a malicious actor to launch a governance attack on the DAO treasury. The potential profit of attacking the DAO treasury is increasing as more ETH accumulates in the treasury, while the cost of attacking the DAO through purchasing ARB for its voting power is not increasing proportionally to defend against attacks. A more developed version of this dynamic exists in the ENS and Compound DAOs, both of which are actively fighting off governance attacks (ENS documented [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/10)).\n\nARB staking unlocks utility and aligns governance by creating a mechanism to stream future rewards from DAO-generated sources like sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification to token holders who are delegated to an active governance participant. ARB staking makes ARB usable in restaking and DeFi by returning voting power locked in contracts to the DAO.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure.\n\n## Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\n### System architecture\n\nARB staking enables ARB utility while allowing the DAO to retain governance power. It includes a few modular components that come together to power the system.\n\nARB staking via the Tally governance staking system\n\n* Has the power to distribute fees proportionally to token holders who have delegated voting power to an active governance participant.\n\nThe DAO\n\n* Has the power to turn on fee distribution and send fees to ARB staking\n* Controls how voting power is distributed to delegates, including delegation strategies for unused voting power\n\nstARB (Tally Protocol LST)\n\n* Auto-compounds potential rewards if they are turned on in the future\n* Provides token holders a liquid position\n* Allows stARB holders to continue delegating directly to their preferred delegate. This can be accomplished through Flexible Voting, or by deploying surrogate contracts for each depositor. \n* Returns voting power to the DAO if stARB is deposited into restaking, DeFi, or centralized exchange smart contracts that do not maintain a 1:1 delegation relationship. The Arbitrum DAO exclusively has the ability to determine how this voting power is distributed/redelegated via a governance proposal. The DAO will decide how to set up the initial redelegation logic for stARB.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreichoivdxj4rgovc7rhpfo4v5tcerlb2bvcus6w7uyjup6kr23hou4)\n\n## Estimated Timeline\n\nPost proposal on forum for feedback: June\n\nPost temp check proposal on Snapshot: August\n\nPost onchain proposal on Tally for funding: August\n\nBegin development: August\n\nSubmit smart contracts for audit: September\n\nSubmit onchain proposal on Tally including full ARB staking implementation: October\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nIf this proposal passes temperature check, we will submit an onchain proposal that includes $200,000 USD in ARB of funding to cover the costs of development, including the following funding categories:\n\n* $50,000 USD in ARB: Develop ARB staking smart contracts\n  * Implement staking contracts\n  * Integrate Arbitrum\u2019s current and potential fee mechanisms\n  * Integrate Karma Score requirement\n  * Enable the DAO to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly\n* $20,000 USD in ARB: Integrate ARB staking into Tally.xyz\n* $50,000 USD in ARB: Integrate Karma into ARB staking\n  * Develop and deploy a smart contract to store key stats and Karma scores onchain\n  * Create a system to record stats onchain and store detailed delegate data off-chain (using Arweave or IPFS) for easy verification\n  * Continuously improve scoring algorithms to adapt to evolving Arbitrum community needs\n  * Provide technical support to delegates experiencing issues with their statistics\n* $60,000 USD in ARB: Audit ARB staking smart contracts\n  * The final cost of the audit including documentation will be published on this thread.

This is because smart contracts can potentially secure millions, if not billions of dollars, yet a single bug in the code can result in the loss of all funds. In many cases, when the smart contract is deployed, it can be difficult to upgrade after launch, and audits should be completed prior to the project going live.\n\nUnfortunately, audits are prohibitively expensive. It is not uncommon for projects to pay ~$20k per auditor per week. If multiple auditors are required for the project, then the bill increases substantially into six figures. This is problematic for early stage projects who may simply lack the funds to pay for an audit or be forced to allocate a significant portion of the funds they have raised from investors to pay for the audit.\n\nThis proposal aims to implement a subsidy scheme that will allocate funds to projects that require financial assistance to pay for an audit. To be eligible for the funds, the project will need to satisfy certain requirements such as launching on Arbitrum, relatively early-stage, and with potential for significant success with users.\n\nWe plan to run the subsidy program for 1 year, or until all funds are spent, with an appointed Arbitrum Audit committee. A subsidy will be offered as a grant or an investment in the project depending on size and long-term alignment.\n\n## Rationale and Goals\n\n1. Support early-stage projects. Promising projects face funding constraints that may prevent their launch without access to a third party audit or for them to somewhat dangerously \u2018test in production.\u2019\n2. Encourage development on Arbitrum. By supporting builders and early-stage projects, we can potentially help make Arbitrum their home over other blockchains.\n3. Scaling Responsibly. Scalability is not just about transaction throughput, but the ability for the system as a whole to secure and protect an increasing number of tokens (TVL).\n4. On-demand availability. An open applications process to offer subsidy grants to projects just in time before their planned launch.\n\n## Application Process\n\n![AD_4nXeV_9xWOh8GneKlTmoCbxjI3SwuSl-jBHACwhAK12LhUEcGRZ61uo_zbDLWruS9--3XRSEbklpgWnyjelk-epVoGEY9D3SwDR9XCqWqlgw5fLl_3Uq42FxNSBlxWLplWv5SSrqvdw.png](ipfs://bafkreidf6kv2ksnjlnhw5ui7whcacsz4yowt67jz4ef57haec6dc2xdgaq)\n\nThe Arbitrum Audit Subsidy Program invites projects to apply via an open applications track with a standardised form to gather the following information:\n\n* Team Information\n  * Names\n  * Background\n  * Notable Investors\n* Project Information\n  * Overview & problem it is solving\n  * Why will project achieve product market fit\n  * Stage of development & timeline to mainnet\n* Audit coverage\n  * Scope of audit\n  * Lines of code & languages\n  * Desired completion date\n* Subsidy information\n  * Preferred auditor [optional]\n  * Audit budget request\n\nThe committee will screen the above information based on:\n\n* **Technical maturity:** Assess whether the code base is ready for a professional audit.\n* **Team experience:** Evaluate whether the team has the experience, expertise, and motivation to successfully launch the project on mainnet.\n* **Likelihood of success:** Judge whether the project has the potential to attract a user base and establish itself as a popular decentralized application on Arbitrum.\n* **Reasonable scope:** Determine if the audit\u2019s scope can be completed within the proposed timeline and budget.\n* **Arbitrum first:** The project will prioritise launching on Arbitrum including One, Nova, and other Arbitrum chains.\n\nA project can be rejected at any stage of the process at the committee\u2019s discretion.\n\nIf the committee approves the project during the screening process, then it will undertake due diligence which may include reference checks, reviewing the code related to the audit scope, and other information it may deem necessary to check. Assuming the due diligence succeeds, then the committee will aid the project in connecting with auditors to get the best quote alongside confirming the auditor has the capability to audit the project.\n\nAn auditor will be picked based on the rate charged, discount offered, availability to begin the audit and other relevant factors such as experience with similar projects and reputation. In regards to the payment schedule, we expect the subsidy to be paid when the audit is completed by the auditor, subject to project\u2019s and Foundation\u2019s satisfaction\n\n## Approving Auditors\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will take on the role of evaluating auditors who want to apply for this program which includes an interview, reference checks, compliance, and agreement to the terms & conditions of this program. It should be noted that we will conduct an individual negotiation with all approved auditors to take into account potential different rates and offerings from the auditors. Additionally, auditors can apply at any time to join the program.\n\nAn approved auditor will have an opportunity to post on the forum to advertise that they have been accepted to the program. This will assist projects with finding auditors that may be suitable for them even if a subsidy is not offered by this program.\n\nAdditionally, we will invite auditing firms from the ADPC\u2019s Security Subsidy Fund to apply, with the intention for us to negotiate additional terms that are suitable for this new program.\n\n## Arbitrum Audit Committee\n\nWe propose a committee with a mixture of technical expertise and DAO representation who will have the necessary skills and time to review proposals on an on-going basis.\n\n1. Chair: Team Member - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n2. Team Member - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n3. Technical Expert - Elected by DAO\n4. Team Member - ArbitrumDAO\u2019s OpCo (when operational). We have included the OpCo as a potential team member as soon as it is operational and considers itself ready to join. We do not see this as a blocker and will begin the program without the OpCo, but eager to have their involvement when it is applicable. \n\nThe committee will enforce a strict conflict of interest policy such that no member should have any financial ties to an approved auditing firm that is taking part in the program and they should not have a significant conflict of interest with competing blockchain projects. The technical expert should not be part of the auditing firms engaged in the program and will be paid USD$5k per month. We expect the workload to be ~1-2 days per week.\n\nScope of work includes:\n\n* Attend committee meetings to evaluate proposals,\n* Support some due diligence efforts on projects,\n* Lend expertise to make good decisions,\n* Help with transparency & reporting.\n\nThe committee will publish updates in regards to the program every 3 months with a total of 4 reports to be published.\n\n## Budget Request\n\nIt is not uncommon for projects to pay $10k to $40k per auditor per week depending on the complexity of the project with overall costs exceeding $100k.\n\nIf we assume, conservatively, that each project will receive a $100k subsidy, then with a $10m budget, we can subsidize around 100 projects to build on Arbitrum which is approximately 1.9 projects per week for 1 year.\n\nWe are requesting a $10m USD budget to subsidise audits for 1 year and $60k to pay for the technical expert. All other costs including legal, management of the program, etc, will be covered by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nOur proposal will:\n\n* Request 30m ARB from the treasury,\n* Convert ARB into $10m and $60k (compensation),\n* Return all remaining and unused ARB back to the DAO\n\nWhenever the program ends, the remaining funds in USDC and ARB, will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO unless the DAO approves the continuation of the program via an off-chain vote.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe consider the establishment of a long-term security subsidy fund as an urgent matter to support builders in Arbitrum and will work with contributors in the ArbitrumDAO to get the program set up as soon as possible.\n\nWith this in the mind, we are expecting the following timeline:\n\n* 06/2/2025 -> Proposal live on forum\n* 20/2/2025 -> Offchain vote (Snapshot)\n* 06/3/2025 -> Onchain vote (Tally)\n\nAdditionally, we are hoping to run the following governance calls:\n\n* 17/2/2025 at 4pm GMT\n* 24/2/2025 at 2pm GMT\n* 03/3/2025 at 6pm GMT\n\nAssuming the proposal is approved by the ArbitrumDAO, then we will:\n\n* Run an election to hire the technical expert by 15th March 2025.\n* Onboard auditors and open applications for projects by mid April 2025.\n\nAn official announcement will be posted for the final start date which will begin the 1 year clock for the program.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "f3b8f182-0565-4191-92b6-a5daf2318be1", "proposal_id": "a6cad78d-173d-4bc0-bc48-6dc947ddeb3a", "snapshot_id": "0x3be7368a662d1cf12fa4da768d626edbc013be0dc7b994fef2e24d9a54e4033a", "title": "AIP-1: Arbitrum Improvement Proposal Framework", "author_name": "0x74369AdDA9E1c8482599B4614f2f31af0d9084e8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3be7368a662d1cf12fa4da768d626edbc013be0dc7b994fef2e24d9a54e4033a", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-03-27 22:13:24", "voting_end": "2023-04-03 22:13:24", "options": {"scores": [16418340.15083403, 100343537.24475034, 14120336.076898294], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-04-03 22:13:24", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.877", "body": "## Category: Constitutional - Process\n\n### Submitted by: Lemma Ltd\n\n### Abstract\nThis document (\u201c**AIP-1**\u201d) proposes the structure of a decentralized autonomous organization called the ArbitrumDAO that would be governed by holders of $ARB, the decentralized token that will serve as the primary token for fostering, developing, authorizing and/or governing the ArbitrumDAO-approved chains (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution). The ArbitrumDAO Constitution, located at https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company, which will serve the ArbitrumDAO community and be governed by it, aims to foster the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the ability to submit Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (\u201c**AIPs**\u201d), vote on them and make them a reality through The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nThe guiding values of The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO are described in Section 5 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and are incorporated herein.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation serves the ArbitrumDAO by administering the wishes of the community and otherwise adhering to its guiding values. The Arbitrum Foundation and DAO governance are intended to serve as vehicles enabling impactful, transparent and fair decentralized governance by the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThrough the submission of AIPs, the ArbitrumDAO will be able to collectively decide and effectuate changes ranging from core protocol technology to non-technical decisions that otherwise impact the community and $ARB tokenholders.\n\n\n### Specifications\n\n**Governance powers breakdown**\n\n**1. $ARB Tokenholders**\n\n* $ARB tokenholders, who make up the ArbitrumDAO, play the most critical role in the proper functioning of decentralized governance in the pursuit of a trustless, transparent and verifiable Arbitrum ecosystem. As Arbitrum is intended to be a public good, it is only right that governance over it should be governed by those for whom such public good is intended for.\n\n* $ARB tokenholders have the ability to directly propose, vote on and effectuate on-chain AIPs with respect to the ArbitrumDAO-approved chains.\n\n\n**2. Special Grants**\n\n* The Arbitrum Foundation shall be permitted to issue grants out of the Administrative Budget Wallet without undergoing a full on-chain AIP process (such grants, \u201c**Special Grants**\u201d).\n\n* The rationale behind the ability of The Arbitrum Foundation to issue Special Grants is to avoid inundating governance with grant applications, while at the same time alleviating voter fatigue.\n\n* The Special Grants application process and criteria will be released at a later date by The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n\n**3. Directors**\n\nAs a Cayman Islands foundation, The Arbitrum Foundation is required to have at least 1 director responsible for the management and operation of The Arbitrum Foundation, in particular approving and entering into contractual arrangements on behalf of The Arbitrum Foundation (i.e., the parties actually approving and signing agreements).|\n\nThe directors are responsible for ensuring that AIPs do not:\n\n* Compromise their fiduciary duties owed to The Arbitrum Foundation;\n* Violate The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association or bylaws, the ArbitrumDAO Constitution, the AIP Process or any other laws or regulations of applicable jurisdictions (including but not limited to Cayman Islands laws); and \n* Cause The Arbitrum Foundation to be in breach or violation of any contracts, agreements or any other arrangements.\n\nThe initial directors of The Arbitrum Foundation are: \n* Campbell Law, \n* Edward Noyons and \n* Ani Banerjee\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may remove or elect The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s directors or expand or reduce the number of directors at any time pursuant to a Non-Constitutional AIP\n\n**4.\tSecurity Council**\nThe Security Council is a committee of 12 members of a multi-sig wallet which has the ability to perform both Emergency and Non-Emergency Actions, which are further detailed in Section 3 of the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nThe initial Security Council members, split by cohort, are as follows:\n\ni.\tSeptember Cohort\n1.\t[Mo Dong](https://twitter.com/no89thkey) is the Co-Founder of Celer Network.

Data Availability Committee (Arbitrum Nova chain only)**\n\nTransactions occurring on the Arbitrum Nova chain are settled on Ethereum mainnet, but, unlike transactions occurring on the Arbitrum One chain, the underlying transaction data batches are posted and stored by the members of the Data Availability Committee on a [Data Availability Server](https://developer.arbitrum.io/das/daserver-instructions) (and not on Ethereum mainnet).\n\nThe initial members of the Data Availability Committee are authorized representatives of the following parties:\n* Reddit, Inc.\n* ConsenSys Software Inc.\n* QuikNode, Inc.\n* P2P Business Technologies\n* Google Cloud ( Google LLC.)\n* Offchain Labs, Inc.\n* Opensea Innovation Labs Private Limited\n\n\nData Availability Committee members can be appointed and removed at any time pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO. In the event that a Data Availability Committee member is removed (and not otherwise replaced) pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO, or in the event that a Data Availability Committee member resigns without a replacement, the Security Council may execute an emergency action (9-of-12 approval required) to appoint a replacement for such removed or resigned Data Availability Committee member.\n\n### AIP Guidelines and Process Breakdown\n\nSection 2 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution lays out the AIP process and voting procedures, as well as the various categories of AIPs, and is incorporated herein.\n\n**Arbitrum Voting Protocol Procedure**\n\n1.

Ratification of the funding of the DAO Treasury (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution)\n6. Approval of the AIP process as described in this AIP-1\n7. Completed setup of the [Arbitrum ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation)[Forum](http://forum.arbitrum.io), [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) and [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum)\n8. Ratification of funding the Administrative Budget Wallet\n9. Ratification of reimbursement of costs as illustrated in the Overall Cost sections below and disbursement of such reimbursements to applicable service providers\n\n**Timeline**\n\nSolution prepared and ready to be ratified and approved\n\n**Overall Costs**\n\n**Initial Setup Costs of The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO**\n\nTotal setup costs, including legal costs, DAO administration setup and registration fees to be reimbursed to service providers:  $3.5 million (\u201c**Total Setup Costs**\u201d)\n\n**DAO Treasury**\nIn order to best provide the ArbitrumDAO with the ability to effectively govern and foster the development of Governed Chains (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution), 3,527,046,079 $ARB tokens have been transferred to the DAO Treasury. The ArbitrumDAO will have direct on-chain governance powers over the DAO Treasury in accordance with the AIP process as delineated in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution.\n\n\n**The Arbitrum Foundation Administrative Budget Wallet**\n\nFor the sake of operational and administrative efficiency, a separate account controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation will be created (\u201c**Administrative Budget Wallet**\u201d). 750 million $ARB tokens will be transferred to the Administrative Budget Wallet for purposes of making Special Grants, reimbursing applicable service providers for the Total Setup Costs and covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation.

However, after vigorous community debate, AIP-1 did not pass.\n\nRationale:\nThe Constitution is a foundational document that lays out the governance system and capabilities of the ArbitrumDAO; the Bylaws and A&R M&A outline The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s relationship with and obligations to the ArbitrumDAO. These documents should be updated, via amendment, to remove references to AIP-1 and also to reflect other changes requested by the community during the debate process over AIP-1.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1. Amendments to the Constitution (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link)\n-Remove references to AIP-1, except as reference to the moment the original Constitution became effective.\n-Make explicit that proposals to amend The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s A&R M&A and Bylaws take the form of a Constitutional AIP.\n-Make explicit that the DAO may make a Non-Constitutional Funding AIP with respect to the Administrative Budget Wallet.\n-Lower the threshold number of Votable Tokens required for an AIP to be posted on-chain from 5,000,000 $ARB to 1,000,000 $ARB.\n-Add a new Section 5, which details the Data Availability Committee, including processes for removing and appointing Data Availability Committee members.\n\n2. Amendments to the Bylaws (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link)\n-Remove references to AIP-1.\n-Clarify that the definition of \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d includes all assets that are contributed to or otherwise acquired by the Administrative Budget Wallet, inclusive of assets specifically approved by the ArbitrumDAO. As pointed out by the DAO in its feedback in response to AIP-1, the \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d defined term in the Bylaws was unclear and didn\u2019t clearly reflect the reality of The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s receipt of 7.5% of the token supply upon the $ARB token genesis.\n-Remove references to \u201cSpecial Grants\u201d and replace with the concept of Arbitrum ecosystem growth.\n-Remove \u201cAIP Threshold\u201d defined term as it is not used elsewhere in the Bylaws\n-Clarify that the ArbitrumDAO may replace The Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s directors, change the number of directors, and require The Arbitrum Foundation to take certain actions.\n\n3. Amendments to the A&R M&A (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link)\n-Remove references to AIP-1.\n\n\nSteps to Implement:\n1. Approval of amended Constitution.\n2. Approval of Amended & Restated Bylaws.\n3. Approval of amendments to the A&R M&A.\n\n\nTimeline:\nThis AIP-1.2 will be posted on the DAO forum and will have at least a 72-hour period for DAO comments and input. After the end of the 72-hour period and appropriate updates incorporating DAO feedback, this AIP-1.2 will be posted for vote on Snapshot for an additional 7 days.

Previous work with Arbitrum includes evaluating key governance upgrades, verifying proposal correctness, and conducting security design assessments for projects like Timeboost and BOLD. Their contributions to the Stylus Contracts Library further solidify their integration into the Arbitrum ecosystem, leveraging expertise in Stylus runtime.\n\nOpenZeppelin\u2019s approach to security includes fuzzing, and rigorous manual review that addresses vulnerabilities from multiple angles, even developing the Defender platform and being the only security provider to identify a critical vulnerability in their Uniswap V4 Audit. Having participated in the ARDC V1, OpenZeppelin carried out reviews of governance upgrades, verification of proposal correctness, and security design evaluations.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\n\n### **Deliverables for first two-months**\n\n*Specific work that we expect to complete within the first two months of the ARDC V2 program. Please note that some of these deliverables are time-dependent on the proposal details being ready for our security feedback within the 2-month time period.*\n\n\n\n1. **Security Council Improvement Suggestions:** OpenZeppelin will contribute recommendations for enhancing the Arbitrum Security Council\u2019s functionality, such as enabling multi-sig support for company entities to streamline operations. We will also propose setting technical requirements to ensure at least 9 of the 12 council members possess the technical skills to independently verify emergency upgrades. We\u2019ve already seen [forum requests](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-security-council-member-test/22809) for testing the technical expertise of Council candidates and [additional suggestions from the Arbitrum Foundation](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686#p-63397-security-council-elections-process-improvements-7) that we plan to address.\n2. **Technical Upgrade Security Feedback & Proposal Reviews on Timeboost, Bold, Orbit Chains and Fast Withdrawals**: Following up on our prior Security Analyses for [BOLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-security-analysis/24938) and [Timeboost](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/timeboost-security-analysis/26832), we expect to review the implementations of these mechanisms for security risks before submission on-chain and provide executive summaries of their impact. We also anticipate reviews of fast withdrawals and Orbit chain proposals that line up with the [Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s recommendations](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686).\n3. **Suggestions to Improve the DAO\u2019s Technical Decision-Making Process:** We\u2019ll explore and recommend a technical decision-making framework to improve the DAO\u2019s current process of debating technical trade-offs when implementing upcoming proposals. We\u2019ll especially take the experiences learned from the [Arbitrum Governor V2 Upgrade discussion](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/change-to-new-governance-contracts-that-allow-proposal-cancellation/27531) on whether to perform a migration upgrade or direct proxy upgrade.\n4. **Definition and Security Risk Analysis of a Governance Attack:** We\u2019ll examine Arbitrum\u2019s current governance system to identify the potential risks of a governance attack similar to Humpy\u2019s earlier attempt on Compound this year, to better safeguard the DAO. This includes defining the difference between a controversial/contentious proposal and an outright governance attack from an outside entity accumulating tokens and manipulating votes in a manner that warrants a security response. This includes answering questions raised by the Arbitrum Foundation [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686#p-63397-governance-optimization-potential-capture-5).\n\n\n### **Ongoing Scope of Work**\n\n*Work that we expect to be ongoing depending on the current proposals and requests made to us throughout our ARDC term.*\n\n\n\n1. **Proposer Assistance and Payload Preparation:** Upon request from a proposal that has passed a snapshot, OpenZeppelin will support non-technical proposal authors in preparing their proposals, guiding them through best practices in proposal construction to meet the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s technical and security requirements. We will offer security insights throughout the drafting process to preemptively address any potential vulnerabilities, helping authors create secure and well-structured proposals. This item comes directly from delegate feedback we received following ARDC V1.\n2. **Proposal Security Review Process:** OpenZeppelin will conduct security reviews of proposal payloads submitted to Tally (ideally in draft form prior to submission), ensuring their integrity and alignment with the intended governance actions. We will provide a final security check to verify that the proposal\u2019s on-chain deployment matches the reviewed content along with an executive summary explaining the proposal\u2019s impact for non-technical readers. This process will include manual security checks, supplemented by automated tools where possible, to ensure robustness and accuracy. Our forum reports on proposal safety will foster transparency and community engagement with proposal security.\n3. **Governance Upgrade Audits:** As the primary auditor for governance upgrades, OpenZeppelin will collaborate closely with Tally and Scopelift to ensure future upgrades are secure and aligned with the Arbitrum DAO\u2019s roadmap. Through this collaboration, we\u2019ll also explore integration opportunities with OpenZeppelin Governor, identifying feature enhancements that could serve both Arbitrum DAO and the broader ecosystem as part of the [OpenZeppelin Governor Working Group](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/announcing-a-new-working-group-for-openzeppelin-governor) that we\u2019ve recently launched alongside Tally, ScopeLift and Agora.\n4. **Additional Security Audits:** While we\u2019ve explicitly proposed that the Security Member serves as the primary auditor for governance upgrades, we are also happy to conduct security audits for other smart contracts wherever the Supervisory Council considers them to be in-scope for the ARDC. This could include any smart contracts to be utilized in a governance proposal such as the [Franchiser Contracts](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-franchiser-contract-audit/25738) used by Event Horizon that we audited in ARDC V1.\n\nThese deliverables address critical security needs and emphasize proactive upgrades and enhanced security governance. OpenZeppelin\u2019s approach allows flexibility in addressing additional security tasks as ARDC\u2019s term progresses. We are also open to additional feedback from other delegates and the guidance of the Supervisory Council, once elected.\n\n\n# **Trail of Bits**\n\n\n\n* **Name of Applicant**: Trail of Bits\n* **Applicant\u2019s Representative**: Ken Trueba\n* **Telegram Handle**: TrailofBits_Ken\n* **LinkedIn Profile**: [Trail of Bits | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trail-of-bits/)\n* **The role being applied for**: Security Working Member\n* **Hourly Rate** : $700\n\n\n## **Experience**\n\nTrail of Bits has been a leader in software security for over 12 years, combining cutting-edge security research with an attacker\u2019s perspective to minimize risks and strengthen code. They have performed over 300 blockchain security reviews, dedicating 200+ engineer weeks of Arbitrum security reviews through their work with Offchain Labs, reviewing essential components such as Nitro, Timeboost Auction, Stylus, BoLD and the majority of ArbOS updates.\n\nTrail of Bits excel in program analysis and tooling, as demonstrated by their numerous open-source projects, such as Slither, Echidna, Medusa, which combine a pragmatic approach and fundamental knowledge to create tools that provide value to their users. Setting them apart from other security consulting firms, Trail of Bits maintains a dedicated Research & Engineering division that integrates the latest advancements in security research into every project.\n\n\n## **Arbitrum Scope of Work:**\n\nFor the initial two months of the 6-month term, our services will include one or more of the following tasks, according to the priorities and needs of the ArbitrumDAO:\n\n\n\n* Review on-chain proposal code updates\n    * White-box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\n    * Reviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\n    * If 12 engineer-weeks are not enough to review all the on-going proposals in a quarter (or 24 in the 6 months period), Trail of Bits will either perform a review of some of the proposals, or a best effort of as many as possible. Trail of Bits will agree with the Arbitrum coalition and its Advocate to determine the priorities.\n    * Deliverables are full security reports with technical information regarding findings and appendices as needed. A typical report follows the outline below:\n        * Executive Summary (short description of what was tested and an analysis of overall security risk based on the findings and brief summary of the recommendations)\n        * Code Maturity Evaluation (holistic evaluation of the codebase and overall approach to software development and security, as well as recommendations intended to inform medium- and long-term strategy for improving software development and resilience to future security incidents)\n        * Comprehensive List of Vulnerabilities (detailed explanations sufficient to identify and/or reproduce the vulnerability, attack and exploit scenario to provide context for the vulnerability, and recommended short- and long-term mitigation steps)\n        * Trail of Bits has a discrete team of Technical Editors that reviews every client deliverable we write and an extensive, internally developed style guide that engineers are trained against.\n* Invariants development\n    * Creation of invariants targeting components for future upgrades. The invariants will help developers of upgrade to ensure the correctness of their addition\n    * Activities may include but are not limited to:\n        * Identify security and correctness at the function or system level\n        * Write invariants to test them with state-of-the-art fuzzers (Echidna, Medusa, foundry fuzzer)\n        * Documentation and guidance to help the community contribute to the invariants\n    * Deliverables are the code for the security invariants produced, in runnable state including any documentation and tool instructions.\n* Tooling Creation and Enhancement\n    * Develop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\n        * Specific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\n        * Visualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\n        * Visualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\n    * Deliverable are specific features in isolated open-source PRs in the repository of each tool with a small description of the impact on the Arbitrum DAO goals.\n* Office hours\n* Security consultation\n* Incident response/disaster recovery\n* Additional services, based on the ARDC needs, which can include:\n    * Design review\n    * Threat modeling\n    * Blogpost or public presentation\n    * Appsec or cryptography review\n    * Guidance on incident response plan or monitoring\n\nTrail of Bits has a robust, adaptive approach to executing projects, and our history of providing high-caliber security research and engineering solutions equips us well for managing ad hoc or flexible tasks, as requested by the Supervisory Council.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "f51f8771-a4c3-49f1-a6c4-69f1d0c9c871", "proposal_id": "fae810b1-485d-4e43-b724-34e2682a7fbc", "snapshot_id": "0xd5a66f784523841511f7ffec4171b9c14404fdbf7c205086312084d19c95c193", "title": "[Constitutional] AIP: Disable Legacy Tether Bridge", "author_name": "0xb5B069370Ef24BC67F114e185D185063CE3479f8", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd5a66f784523841511f7ffec4171b9c14404fdbf7c205086312084d19c95c193", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-07-24 15:00:00", "voting_end": "2025-07-31 15:00:00", "options": {"scores": [159441989.69554573, 5446.188570151988, 31811743.893773105], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2025-07-31 15:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:58.887", "body": "Note: this proposal will be subject to an individual Snapshot vote; if it reaches a quorum of 3% of votable $ARB, it may be combined with several other maintenance-related proposals for a joint Tally vote.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to disable the legacy USDT bridge for Arbitrum One, given the activation of the new [USDT0 bridge](https://mirror.xyz/tetherzero.eth/_6FNgGi0WHHQhA9qavZ4rlt-nV9ehVuJUHxQnSwOmbM) in January 2025. While the majority of crosschain volume has migrated to the new USDT0 bridge, the legacy USDT bridge is still technically enabled. This proposal seeks to disable the legacy bridge entirely, rather than continue with the current configuration which subjects depositors to a week-long delay and risks loss of funds if the depositor is a smart contract.\n\n# Motivation\n\nHistorically, the existing USDT bridge for Arbitrum One was the primary path for bridging Tether to and from Arbitrum One. The new [USDT0 standard](https://mirror.xyz/tetherzero.eth/_6FNgGi0WHHQhA9qavZ4rlt-nV9ehVuJUHxQnSwOmbM) introduced a modernized alternative that has become the go-to solution. However, the legacy USDT bridge is still technically enabled, which presents several issues.\n\nFirst, withdrawals from the legacy bridge to L1 are subject to a seven-day delay, which is meaningfully slower than the new USDT0 bridge which can process bridge transactions in seconds or minutes. Also, once this delay has elapsed, deposits are auto-withdrawn on L1. This inconvenience can be addressed by disabling the legacy bridge and directing users exclusively to the new USDT0 bridge.\n\nSecond, user funds could be lost if a smart contract deposits to the legacy bridge on their behalf. The legacy bridge is currently configured to auto-withdraw funds as soon as possible back to the depositor; however, this auto-withdraw configuration can cause problems for smart contracts that deposit on behalf of end users but do not have withdrawal or refund functionality. While it\u2019s possible to recover funds in this scenario, it is certainly sub-optimal for smart contract operators and end users that delegate to them. Disabling the legacy bridge prevents smart contracts from encountering this issue and putting funds at risk. Also, once the legacy bridge is disabled, any transaction submitted to it will simply revert; this applies to third party integrations as well as direct user interactions.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* **USDT0**: Tether\u2019s new OFT-based version of USDT; more details [here](https://mirror.xyz/tetherzero.eth/4z1kh9wE6h07zGjrKImx4Cr-VIzCpRle0VElalG0Rss)\n\n* **DisableGatewayAction**: A smart contract action that disables a gateway for a specified token from the [L1GatewayRouter](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72ce9c846789fdb6fc1f34ac4ad25dd9ef7031ef#code); the DisableGatewayAction source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/src/gov-action-contracts/token-bridge/DisableGatewayAction.sol)\n\n# Specifications\n\nDeactivate Legacy Bridge: execute the \u2018[perform](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d3425f7039645223517f6f6e60ef04c28f4188f#writeContract#F1)\u2019 function on the DisableGatewayAction contract, disabling legacy USDT on the L1GatewayRouter contract\n\n* DisableGatewayAction: [0x8d3425f7039645223517F6F6e60Ef04C28f4188F](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d3425f7039645223517f6f6e60ef04c28f4188f#code)\n* L1GatewayRouter: [0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72ce9c846789fdb6fc1f34ac4ad25dd9ef7031ef#code)\n* Legacy USDT: [0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7)\n\n# Steps to Implement\n1.

This proposal requests a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract via Arbitrum native bridge, as only the Arbitrum DAO can implement this change. The custom gateway will enable more efficient governance processes for while reducing user costs and improving overall accessibility for RARI DAO. The proposal asks to register the custom L2 token to a custom gateway on the Arbitrum native bridge.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRARI DAO is governed by the $RARI token, which when locked in veRARI grants voting access. The current token contract is on Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradable. The RARI DAO wishes to upgrade its governance, a part of which is a token contract upgrade with snapshots and delegations embedded. Only the Arbitrum DAO can however set up the mapping of L1 -> L2 token addresses in the custom gateway (which is controlled by Arbitrum DAO)  on the Arbitrum native bridge. Here is more information about the topic: https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe RARI DAO multichain governance upgrade is designed to make governance more accessible by simplifying the UX, reducing gas fees, and enabling new token functions. This aligns with Artbitrum's commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.\n\nWith a custom L2 token implementation we will be able to perform the RARI DAO governance upgrade and move our governance fully into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMore on RARI DAO's plan for governance upgrade can be found HERE.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nRARI token: RARI DAO governance token (https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf\n\nRARI DAO: body governing the Rarible Protocol and RARI chain\n\nCustom L2 RARI token: upgraded and simplified RARI token to be used in RARI DAO multichain governance moving forward\n\n## Specifications\n\nRARI token in question (https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf) does not have upgradability nor allows the owner to register in the Arbitrum token bridge router.\n\nAs such, we're requesting a custom L2 token implementation and using the (standard) custom gateway. Lacking the ability to upgrade / owner-register, we are seeking Artbirum DAO's approval to register the upgraded RARI token to the custom gateway so we can proceed with the custom L2 implementation.\n\nThe upgraded token contract was fully audited and can be found here: [https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305).\n\nToken contract was deployed to Arbitrum Sepolia, RARI testnet (which is on top of Arbitrum Sepolia) and all contracts were tested manually as well.\n\nRARI DAO voted in favor of the upgraded token: https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n1. Deploy token contracts on Arbitrum and RARI chains (done)\n2. Security audit of the proposed code change (in progress by Arbitrum Foundation)\n3. Onchain vote to change mapping for L1 \u2192 L2 tokens on bridge router and custom gateway (This can be done only by Arbitrum DAO)\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplementation upon the proposal's execution (aiming late September).\n\n## Overall costs\n\nN/A", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "f58fe72b-0ee0-4404-a058-fe136e672749", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x229d84d52e05978d5a116913f4ce19e7da28a3df39aa89e7811255684f7e52ae", "title": "Beefy LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0xAD16ebE6FfC7d96624A380F394cD64395B0C6144", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x229d84d52e05978d5a116913f4ce19e7da28a3df39aa89e7811255684f7e52ae", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [149113759.0206365, 111077.83026977234, 4415649.892844989], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.653", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/beefy-ltipp-application-draft/21331\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nBeefy presented a clear execution strategy to help use incentives to bootstrap its new ALM products. The rest of their application was also very thorough in regards to milestones, KPIs, and available data. Their team has proven its ability to execute and they have gained significant traction on Arbitrum since STIP.

We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback*\nYes, we will be supporting the proposal. Beefy has a solid reputation and a proven track record of building successful protocols not only on Arbitrum but also across other EVM ecosystems. The team's experience is commendable, instilling confidence in their ability to deliver on their proposed milestones. However, there is a concern regarding the timeline for disbursing the incentives, as the proposed timeframe seems to exceed the duration of the program. This discrepancy should be addressed to ensure proper fund allocation and utilization. The Beefy ALM product is innovative, leveraging concentrated liquidity from various DEXes on the Arbitrum ecosystem to incentivize users, which is a unique approach to distributing incentives. Nevertheless, there are some weaknesses to consider, such as the potential lack of stickiness of liquidity gained via LTIP Rewards and the competition in the concentrated liquidity space. Additionally, the selection criteria for incentivized pools and the sizable grant amount for an unproven product raise some concerns. While the project shows promise, it may face challenges in attracting significant TVL without sufficient incentives.

In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation\u2019s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup \u2013 linearly unlocking over 4 years \u2013 alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation\u2019s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\nMotivation\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n\n-Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n-Control over the DAO treasury\n-Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n-All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n-Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain\u2019s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that\u2019s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum\u2019s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nRationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation\u2019s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the \u201cAdministrative Budget Wallet\u201d will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation\u2019s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\nOperating Budget: Cost ($USD)\nGeneral and Administrative:\t$16,000,000\nR&D:\t$9,000,000\nTechnical Infrastructure:\t$5,000,000\nEvents, Marketing & Communications:\t$6,000,000\nTotal - Next Twelve Months:\t$36,000,000\n(50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation\u2019s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation\u2019s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation\u2019s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation\u2019s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation\u2019s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found here 163.\n\nSteps to Implement\n\n1. Foundation to deploy smart contract vesting wallet in the specified configuration and transfer 700 million $ARB to it.\n2. Foundation to implement all processes described in this AIP.\nTimeline\n\nThis AIP-1.1 shall be posted on the DAO forum and will have at least a 72-hour period for DAO comments and input. After the end of the 72-hour period and appropriate updates incorporating DAO feedback, this AIP-1.1 will be posted for vote on Snapshot for an additional 7 days.\n\n", "match_confidence": 0.878, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "f8ecd9fd-6b1f-4be3-8a5e-04d4dec26cbc", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0xf495f6689d99adb21744dc2ac72b4e5f945375b3a0bc6fc38ba4725fba39cfa1", "title": "GammaSwap LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf495f6689d99adb21744dc2ac72b4e5f945375b3a0bc6fc38ba4725fba39cfa1", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [155435802.90017432, 162540.2384056054, 455432.7756401645], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.562", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gammaswap-ltipp-application-draft/21586\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nGammaSwap\u2019s application was good and scored well across a range of criteria. They provide clear and concise explanations of their milestones, KPIs, and objectives.\nTheir product is innovative and unique and attempts to solve a major problem for one of the largest DeFi categories. We really like their esARB mechanism which should create a notable amount of supply side benefits post LTIPP. Their execution strategy is sound and their TVL estimations and calculations are sufficiently justified.\nUnfortunately, they are a niche product that is complex and may not appeal to a lot of users which is indicated in their lack of adoption. Nonetheless, there still seems to be some baseline of activity.\nTheir requested grant size is on the larger end for their protocol usage, however, given the points above we think it\u2019s sufficiently justified.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis application largely suffered from being a very large request relative to the TVL and age of the protocol. It would also have benefited from more details around under what conditions or guidelines the incentives would be deployed, as they currently appear to be very discretionary for the applicant. Recommend the applicant resubmit in future grants cycles once there is more history and an initial success to build upon using grant funding.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nGammaSwap presented a strong application, scoring well across most of the rubric. We did feel the grant ask was a little high relative to their TVL, but given the uniqueness to their product we can understand how the protocol may not attract your everyday user.

This proposal outlines the scope of DeDaub's engagement and the budget required from the ADPC\u2019s funds.\n\n#### Services Provided by DeDaub:\nDeDaub will be responsible for:\nCrafting Technical and Business Requirements: They will develop the specifications for the Request for Proposal (RFP) directed towards potential security service providers.\nWhitelisting Assistance: Over a period of four weeks, DeDaub will aid the ADPC in evaluating responses to the RFP and whitelisting suitable security service providers.\n\n#### Background of DeDaub:\nDeDaub is a security services firm with a significant track record, having conducted over 200 audits across 14 different blockchain platforms, including partnerships with major entities like the Ethereum Foundation and Chainlink.\n\n#### Budget Request:\nThe total budget request (which will be taken from the ADPC\u2019s current Multi-sig and will not require further extraction of funds from the ArbitrumDAO Treasury) for engaging DeDaub and ensuring operational flexibility for the ADPC is 22,000 ARB, broken down as follows:\n\n- 12,000 ARB for DeDaub\u2019s services related to the RFP process and whitelisting.\n- 10,000 ARB as an operational buffer for the ADPC, to allow for quick response capabilities and to cover unforeseen expenses. This amount will be returned to the DAO\u2019s treasury at the end of the ADPC\u2019s tenure if not utilized.\n\n#### Justification for Budget:\nThe compensation for DeDaub is considered fair given the market rates for Security SMEs and the specialized nature of the services.\nThe operational buffer is essential for maintaining the ADPC\u2019s effectiveness without frequent DAO approvals for minor expenditures.\n\n#### Approval Process:\nThis proposal requires the DAO\u2019s confirmation via a Snapshot vote to allocate funds from the ADPC\u2019s Multi-Sig wallet, which holds the necessary budget as part of the initial endowment. This action is needed due to the absence of prior explicit approval for these specific expenditures in the original DAO vote.\n\n#### Additional Notes:\nDeDaub, by providing these services, will be excluded from participating as a contender in the RFP, ensuring no conflicts of interest in the selection process of security service providers.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe ADPC strongly believes that the onboarding of DeDaub and the approval of the proposed budget are critical steps toward enhancing our security infrastructure and maintaining the integrity of the ADPC's operations. We urge the DAO members to approve this proposal to facilitate timely and efficient execution of these essential tasks.", "match_confidence": 0.0, "match_method": "unmatched"}, {"id": "f975a586-c5b0-457a-a79c-c14d75fe0f7b", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x979c4e09025029df81cd0a30dbb24e505e2f0ab5525d45cd83d48c879da6294b", "title": "Covenant Finance LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal", "author_name": "0xAD16ebE6FfC7d96624A380F394cD64395B0C6144", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x979c4e09025029df81cd0a30dbb24e505e2f0ab5525d45cd83d48c879da6294b", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2024-04-09 00:00:00", "voting_end": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "options": {"scores": [98200218.7702138, 7454185.276750373, 15706317.461894156], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2024-04-16 00:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:00.605", "body": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/covenant-finance-ltipp-application-draft/21821\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\nCovenant Finance\u2019s application was decent and they provided a clear vision of how they expect to benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their product is unique and introduces a new primitive to DeFi.\nTheir grant request is not large and their justification is sound. However, we are concerned about their ability to execute given their age and lack of adoption due to Beta and Alpha stages.\nTheir composability with Uniswap V3 is great and the ability for the protocol to work with long-tail and obscure assets is a great added benefit.\nGiven they are deployed on Optimism, we feel it should ultimately be up to the DAO to decide whether or not they want to take a risk in funding a potentially new DeFi primitive that improves Arbitrum\u2019s competitive advantage. We will be supporting this application.\n\n\n*GFX Feedback*\nWe found this to be an interesting project, and a grant plan that was simple and clear. Unfortunately, the applicant did not quite meet the cutoff where we recommend a grant be approved. Recommend the applicant resubmit in later grants cycles and focus on improving their score in the security and product usage areas. What would make this grant plan much stronger would be to go live, have some success, identify the levers that were pulled to make that happen, and then tailor a grant to scale or reproduce that initial success.\n\n*GMX Feedback*\n\nCovenant Finance aims to bring new debt markets to the Arbitrum and Crypto Markets. The product is innovative as it allows for a perpetual debt which is not currently offered on Arbitrum. The project is able to integrate many of the native debt tokens in the ecosystem including Pendle-YT tokens. Although the project is in early stages I feel the level of innovation the project brings may be a net positive for the ecosystem, the grant size is modest and I think worth the risk for the DAO. The KPIs and milestones also seem reasonable and well thought out. We would be supporting the proposal. \n\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nCovenant presents a novel DeFi primitive focusing on instantiating liquidity for perpetual debt markets. While they lack usage, we believe this is an interesting use-case for Arbitrum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem. They provided a strong execution plan and KPIs with relatively sound milestones.

It had overwhelming support, we believe, because you a) trust our motives and capabilities, and b) understand how big and important the problem is:\n\nNearly every DAO struggles to create sustainable value - largely because DAO decision-making is famously slow, and inefficient, which drives them to compromise their values and centralize. Arbitrum is committed to being better, and you believed in our ability to help.\n\n## Background (Milestone 1a Retrospective)\n\nAcross Milestones 1a, we pluralistically deployed funds via 12 different grants programs and different modalities for grants decision-making.\n\nExperimenting with multiple modalities allows us to allocate grants to support quick feedback about what works and can scale now. We can quickly evolve our grants decision making based the below success rubric, which determines where to allocate grants:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/19f2561a1ec3653e1dbc41d5a646874c679c4d6a_2_621x415.jpeg)\n\n* Grow = double-down / start to scale\n* Coach = make changes / try again\n* Cut = discontinue / recommend to seed program\n\nIn Milestone 1a, we seeded the initial 12 Grants Programs. In Milestone 1b, we will lean on our newly established Plurality Labs board (more later!) as well as community voices who can evaluate our grants via our Thrive Protocol to inform where to cut, coach, and grow.\n\n[Based on our pluralistic grants framework and success criteria, these are the current results of milestone 1 ([details here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/plurality-labs-milestone-1-review/20198/2?u=senad.eth))]\n\n### Milestone 1a Wins include:\n\n* Firestarters: Four proposals passed Snapshot because of our Firestarters program - which funds unbiased research, cat herding, and crafting of proposals crucial to the DAO. These include STIP, ARDC, ARPC, and STEP. ([TNorm talking about our role with STIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pAiy5IABZ48b0o-NqVIRcu4_NRuM9vzI/view?usp=sharing))\n* Experimenting with Grants Decision-Making Modalities: We drove over 30 experiments in collective decision-making, including proactive and retroactive grant-making, and grant-making driven by experts, expert-counsels, permissionless counsels, random counsels, and direct input mechanisms.\n* Retroactive Grants: We drove the first retroactive grants program in Arbitrum, rewarding unpaid contributors, and setting the stage for follow-on experiments. Some of these people are creating obvious value in the ecosystem now, like Atom from castlecap who is now an LTIPP advisor.\n* Quadratic Funding: Via Gitcoin, we brought thousands of new users, and hundreds of builders and builder projects to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Milestone 1a Lessons:\n\n* Investing in documentation: We funded 250+ projects, and spurred movement all over the DAO. But we didn\u2019t document our work and value well. More importantly, we didn\u2019t deliver certain written deliverables that people in the DAO were expecting on time. It hurt us. We won\u2019t make that mistake again.\n* Investing in communications: Our bias was for action. We cared about creating value and learning - and put blinders on for everything else. We should have hired a Marketing or Comms person. We didn\u2019t. Going forward, we\u2019ll button up. We have a good story to tell. We\u2019re excited to tell it.\n* Leveraging internal team: Plurality Labs was acquired by ThriveCoin in August of 2023. We have a team of 26 people who support other big ecosystems. We could have leveraged Thrive best practices. But in an effort to stay \u201ctrue\u201d to the Milestone 1 proposal, we kept the teams separate - too separate. We\u2019ll use all available resources this time.\n\n### Vision \nWe have a big vision. We\u2019re seeking to build the most robust pluralistic grants ecosystem in DAO history. To do it, we took some big shots on goal in Milestone 1a - funding 12 grant programs using 30 decision making experiments to fund 250+ projects. Some shots scored and others missed.\n\nThis is aligned with the expectations of the pluralistic grants approach. The only way to create and scale pluralistic grants is to decentralize bet taking\u2026 and to get as comfortable with the shots that embarrassingly fly into the stands as we are with the goals.\n\nWe will use data to help us double-down on winners and cut others. With the data we\u2019re collecting, we will create a robust, long-term pluralistic grants framework for Arbitrum DAO. This framework is emerging now, and it will continue to become clearer throughout Milestone 1b(ridge). \n\n## Milestone 1(bridge):\n\nIn our maiden proposal, the principal outcome we sought to achieve was to demonstrate that we could deliver and scale enormous value creation via a pluralistic grants framework. The general feedback from delegates has been: kind of\u2026\n\nThere seems to be wide agreement that we created value but need to scale,  document, and showcase.\n\nThus, after consultation with a number of the top delegates, we created this Milestone 1b(ridge) proposal that asks for the exact same amount of ARB and same timeframe as passed with 99% of delegate vote in August.\n\nIn Milestone 1b, we will show:\n\n1. We can build on winners and cut underperformers with our initial grants allocations.\n2. We can continue to drive experimentation with new grants allocations.\n3. We can deliver on all deliverables for Milestone 1 to the satisfaction of our top delegates.\n4. We can leverage better tech and systems to support further scale in Milestone 2.\n\nTo ensure we achieve these goals, we are implementing best-practices from the Thrive team that, also, are aligned with feedback we received from delegates:\n\n1. Plurality Labs Board: We are welcoming a board of top voices in the Arbitrum community for oversight, and to ensure decentralized decision-making.\n2. Human validations: Thrive Protocol allows us to validate when value is created, and pay out funds to projects upon value creation. This is critical for scale. We\u2019ll use it.\n3. Team upgrade: We are bringing in the big guns for this one, adding team members that know grants, know DAOs, and know scale.\n\nHere\u2019s more information about our commitments in Milestone 1b(ridge):\n\nPlurality Labs Board: We brought together trusted and known voices in the Arbitrum community. Their role with us is to gather feedback and data from our Arbitrum community, and to make strategic decisions about grants allocators, specific grants / contributions, and validations.\n\nThis board is part of this vote. We found people to represent the different stakeholder groups in Arbitrum. Now your votes will ratify this group - which includes two who voted \"No\" to our temp check for Milestone 2! \n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81db971f7a5e9910d522a44171d3f3625bffb3cb_2_936x702.jpeg)\n\nHuman Validations: Going forward, we will fund our grants at specific milestones of value creation. White-listed Arbitrum community members will - in a pluralistic way - help clarify when value is created, and will also be rewarded for their services (more on this later).\n\nTeam revamp: We are fully utilizing our 26-person ThriveCoin team), we have also added some key team members to our roster, including: Ben West (GitCoin grants lead), Kyler Wandler (DAO Research Collective), and Scott Mandel (Complex Labs, Flexa, 2Q Ventures).\n\n## Cost\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we\u2019ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework. We are also adding a layer of oversight to our work - welcoming an esteemed Plurality Labs board. They will, among other things, help ensure we deliver the value we promise.\n\nThe 560k ARB services fee (same ARB and same buckets as first proposal) includes:\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we\u2019ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework.

No social contract, guidelines, or policy will be adopted directly from the result of this vote.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to kickstart a conversation around the adoption of Shutter\u2019s shielded voting as a default for Snapshot temperature checks. Shielded voting encrypts votes during the voting period and decrypts them only after the vote closes, mitigating bandwagon effects, voter apathy, and last-minute strategic voting. A Snapshot vote to gauge the DAO's sentiment will be posted on **Thursday, August 8th**. Please note, this is an actual temperature check, just to gauge the DAO\u2019s opinion on the subject.\n\n## Background\n\nShutter\u2019s shielded voting differs slightly from a traditional [secret ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot) where voter\u2019s identity and selection are kept anonymous. In this case, votes are encrypted during the voting period and are decrypted only after the vote closes. Put more simply, during the voting process, a voter\u2019s position is private, and after the vote, positions are made public. You can see who voted, but not their choice or the total VP per option, until the poll has closed (to clarify any confusion please see the demo linked below). Shutter\u2019s shielded voting on Snapshot has been live for over 2 years now and additional details about the implementation can be found on their [blog](https://blog.shutter.network/announcing-shutter-governance-shielded-voting-for-daos/). A live demo of shielded voting can be found on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/pistachiodao.eth/proposal/0xa5077ef17097b1d59304b110337bd1c7ce98d95d3ff81d138c3886a80074b4d9).\n\nOther DAOs have run experiments with shielded voting in the past. Results from a 2-month trail period in Aave DAO can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-private-voting-for-aave-governance-2-month-trial/12730/31). It is important to note that the majority of Aave DAO's proposals are related to protocols parameters, which require more specific knowledge sets on risk & economics. Therefore, it's not immediately clear how directly the results from Aave DAO can be compared to Arbitrum DAO. \n\n## Rationale\n\nIn the 19th century, most western democracies transitioned from public to private voting methods in elections primarily to reduce voter coercion. While voter coercion is not a widespread issue in the onchain governance space, public votes are susceptible to a few other negative phenomenons:\n\n* **Bandwagon Effect:** Voters without a strong opinion tend to go with the current majority opinion. With shielded voting, no one can see how the vote is progressing, thus preventing delegates from being persuaded simply by popular choice.\n\n* **Voter Apathy:** On the flipside, when those in a minority opinion see that their vote no longer impacts the results of either an election or decisions, they may choose not to vote at all. This can be due to feelings that their vote doesn't matter or that strategically it is not worth the social capital to publicly dissent against the majority.\n\n* **11th Hour Voting:** With public voting there is an inherent information mismatch, as the last voter has much more available information to act on than the first voter. Currently, there is a strong incentive to wait until the last possible minute to vote. In some instances this is benevolent behavior as large delegates may not want to indirectly create a bandwagon effect, but other times it can be seen as borderline misbehavior when a late vote is used to strategically create an outcome.\n\nTo clarify, we are not arguing that Arbitrum DAO is currently suffering from these effects, but they are each possible with the current public system. There are also downsides to private voting that we'd like to highlight:\n\n* Overall participation may go down if smaller delegates feel like their positions are no longer impactful, as public voting gives those delegates a chance to strongly voice their opinions by voting early. \n* Politically savvy parties who have the ability or connections to coordinate now have an even bigger advantage.\n* Those who choose to publicly signal their positions gain an advantage over a silent opposition, as some delegate may hold a firm position on silence until the vote concludes. \n* Delegates that know how the votes are falling due to backdoor channels can potentially then use residual votes strategically. With public voting methods, this is something that most everyone can do with less effort and connections. \n\nIn general though, Shutter\u2019s shielded voting allows Arbitrum DAO to remain consistent with practice in liberal democracies that votes taken by elected officials (delegates in this case) are publicized so that citizens can judge voting records. Since it addresses many of the aforementioned concerns with public voting methods, Entropy felt it was a worthwhile conversation to bring to the DAO.\n\n## Specifications\n\nGiven there are some advantages in certain scenarios to private votes for temperature checks, Entropy Advisors is kickstarting this conversation by posing the following question:\n\n**Should Arbitrum DAO default to using shielded voting for Snapshot votes?**\n\nThere will be 4 Voting Choices:\n\n* For all Snapshot Votes\n* For Elections Only\n* Against\n* Abstain\n\nIt is our recommendation that proposal authors still be granted the ability to include reasoning for if a vote should be public instead of shielded. If properly justified, we see no reason to force all Snapshot votes to be shielded (at the DAO\u2019s discretion).\n\n## Timeline\n\nA Snapshot poll will be posted on **August 8th** to gauge the DAO\u2019s overall sentiment and allow for ample conversation beforehand.\n\nAdditional proposals to follow will include temperature checks for COI policy, delegate code of conduct, and other ideas to improve the DAO\u2019s operational processes. If the vote passes, shielded voting will be incorporated along with the other aforementioned ideas that pass a temp check into a larger proposal. This proposal will look to codify all of the DAO\u2019s new processes into a socially enforceable proposal. After a trial period of the more grandiose unified proposal around DAO Operations, we hope to eventually implement the ideas that have worked best into the Constitution.\n\nIt is important to note, that delegates are already free to post shielded votes. In the case that shielded voting is favored by the DAO, more shielded votes are encouraged while this larger proposal is being worked on.\n\n## Cost\n\nThere is no cost to the DAO as shielded voting is already available to all DAOs on Snapshot.", "match_confidence": 0.99, "match_method": "exact_title"}, {"id": "fc43a8a2-8e00-4d15-849b-37b99ba66794", "proposal_id": "b526eec7-4913-4be1-9fe3-6868c692a541", "snapshot_id": "0x959fb55d9887a68d3df6647e55010692777cc40e5c9b131dfdb3eedb8970dc6a", "title": "Proposal for Piloting Enhancements and Strengthening the Sustainability of ArbitrumHub in the Year Ahead", "author_name": "0xd333Bc5c9670C9cEb18f9A2CF02C6E86807a8227", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x959fb55d9887a68d3df6647e55010692777cc40e5c9b131dfdb3eedb8970dc6a", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2025-01-23 16:00:00", "voting_end": "2025-01-30 16:00:00", "options": {"scores": [4738624.124694626, 6944707.431125336, 12550762.530926157, 98427751.28586242], "choices": ["For with retroactive", "For without retroactive", "Abstain", "Against"]}, "last_activity": "2025-01-30 16:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:39:59.431", "body": "**Note:** This proposal is a revised version of our initial draft shared for discussion on November 30th. In reality, it represents the 3rd proposal after incorporating valuable feedback from community members and key delegates.

From the past year, we have independently built, managed and maintained the platform using the resources at our disposal. Despite these limitations, we strive to provide the most accurate and updated information, deploying any additional resources to improve its quality.  \nWe encourage you to view this platform as a **proof of concept** for what we aim to achieve. Imagine the possibilities we could unlock with dedicated support and resources from the DAO. The DAO support would enable us to significantly enhance this platform and fully realize its potential.\n\n## DAO Feedback Addressed\nBased on feedback from the DAO, we are considering carrying ArbitrumHub as a pilot for the first year with a limited scope. The core focus will be on addressing content needs and refining the platform based on community feedback, DAO needs while utilizing minimal resources.\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Core Focus on Platform Maintenance:** Prioritizing ongoing platform maintenance and updates over expansion.\n- **Reduced Fragmentation:** We are adopting a focused approach to streamline efforts and consolidate resources, ensuring a strong foundation for ArbitrumHub.\n- **Minimal Resources:** Operating with a minimal resource allocation to ensure efficient use of funds and focus on core needs.\n\n### MSS Setup for Fund Request:\n- **Quarterly Fund Withdrawals:** Funds will be withdrawn on a quarterly basis from the MSS.\n- **Initiative Termination Clause:** The initiative may be stopped if the DAO reaches a consensus that the proposed value is not being delivered at any point.\n\n## Comparison Between Foundation site and ArbitrumHub:\nThe Foundation is one of the bodies of the Arbitrum DAO, focused primarily on providing specific information aimed at builders. Their goal is to make the Arbitrum blockchain more efficient. The Foundation's target audience includes developers and builders, with an emphasis on onboarding them to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIn contrast, ArbitrumHub provides a comprehensive overview of all Arbitrum DAO initiatives, including governance and various ecosystem activities. Our target audience includes individuals involved in governance, Web3 service organizations, strategists, and community members from arbitrum and other DAOs, as well as anyone interested in understanding what Arbitrum has to offer.\n\nAdditionally, ArbitrumHub serves as a platform to showcase community initiatives on a single platform, ensuring better visibility and reach. For instance, the Community Hub serves as a space to highlight community-driven contributions\u2014something that is currently lacking within the Arbitrum ecosystem. ArbitrumHub is fulfilling this need by providing a dedicated space for these initiatives and enhancing the accessibility to everyone.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that the Foundation's website is effective in its purpose, we recognize that the Foundation has a distinct goal and target audience. The Foundation\u2019s internal focus is on improving the Arbitrum blockchain for builders, while their external focus revolves around onboarding builders to the Arbitrum blockchain and presenting relevant information accordingly.\n\n### Foundation Focus:\n- **Internal Focus:** Enhancing the Arbitrum blockchain for builders.\n- **External Focus:** Onboarding builders to the Arbitrum blockchain, with information presented in a way that caters specifically to their needs.\n\n![258d08ba92894870e422a8833fd31aa2d8e6780c_2_592x300[1].jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiav5jw2ddwbev2hgav6tbqpbpavjeqoqzcrx22e6p3zg5b6ybbvx4)\n**Note:** The image above represents the bi-annual progress report, highlighting the scope and target audience of the Arbitrum Foundation. It illustrates how ArbitrumHub complements the Foundation's efforts rather than duplicating them. In fact, ArbitrumHub has previously been utilized by the Foundation to showcase various grant programs and accepted projects. ArbitrumHub aims to serve as a comprehensive, one-stop solution for all things arbitrum. The ArbitrumHub team is committed to collaborating with the Foundation and the leaders of various community initiatives to ensure its relevance across all verticals within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n**Source:** [Arbitrum Foundation Bi-Annual Progress Update H1 2024](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-foundation-bi-annual-progress-update-h1-2024/26538)\n\n## ArbitrumHub Focus:\n- **Internal Focus:** Providing a comprehensive overview of all Arbitrum DAO initiatives, governance, and ecosystem activities, with a strong emphasis on platform maintenance and refinement based on community feedback.\n- **External Focus:** Engaging a broad audience, including governance participants, Web3 organizations, strategists, and community members from other DAOs, by offering insights into what the Arbitrum ecosystem has to offer.

Abstract\n\nThe ArbitrumHub project emerged from over a year of active involvement in the Arbitrum ecosystem, during which we identified a critical need for a unified platform for ArbitrumDAO. Through extensive community engagement, research, and participation in DAO meetings, it became evident that new members, centralized organizations, participants from other DAOs, and young enthusiasts lacked a single point of reference for all developments and initiatives within the ecosystem. To address this gap, we began laying the foundation of ArbitrumHub 1+ year ago. With dedicated research, collaboration with key stakeholders, and a project team committed to design, development, and iteration, ArbitrumHub has evolved into a comprehensive resource at [arbitrumhub.io](https://www.arbitrumhub.io).\n\n![9639757fe0e675e465f7d87a94665d1d575179b0_2_790x750[1].jpeg](ipfs://bafybeibsiuffn6v3v6t7ylxctfduy3ueoxe3ptp6bs3wg7eozdedt5c5b4)\n\n# 2. Motivation\n\nArbitrumHub was created to address the critical need for a centralized resource hub within the ArbitrumDAO community. As the ecosystem expands, it becomes increasingly challenging to stay informed and connected. ArbitrumHub simplifies this process by offering a single, reliable source of essential information, structured in a way that is both accessible and comprehensive. \nArbitrumHub aspires to become the community\u2019s go-to destination for vital insights into ArbitrumDAO and its ongoing initiatives. By maintaining a unified platform, we ensure community members and external participants have access to updates, meeting details, and opportunities to engage with the ecosystem. This approach not only strengthens community involvement but also fosters a more informed and engaged Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n![44b5eceefda5f291ee82b2e86e425ba132f416dd_2_936x630[1].png](ipfs://bafybeieazvqjqvatfzetoiodvu25slxhhgsat7xazfw552jecmbmzl3y6a)\n\n\n# 3. Rationale for DAO Approval\n\nArbitrumHub serves as the essential first point of contact for existing and new users in the Arbitrum ecosystem, consolidating scattered information and providing a continuously updated resource. Given the importance of this platform in fostering ecosystem cohesion and accessibility, we are seeking DAO approval to formalize ArbitrumHub\u2019s role within the ArbitrumDAO structure.\n\nSecuring DAO support would allow us to designate ArbitrumHub as a DAO-backed platform, which we can publicly display in the About section on ArbitrumHub.io, reinforcing its credibility and trust within the ecosystem. Formal approval would also enable a closer working relationship with DAO program managers and delegates, establishing an ongoing feedback loop and creating a foundation for designing and implementing effective Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with key stakeholders. This formalized connection ensures that ArbitrumHub remains aligned with the DAO\u2019s strategic objectives, enhancing the platform\u2019s long-term impact and value to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n![43e45b56a1b48ce31882a32c80856120148c22c8_2_936x724[1].png](ipfs://bafybeicsou6sovh3a6gsnqto3m7speh5nfvshxp6kg5qqfemwaqi7zbkcu)\n\n\n# 4. Key Uses of ArbitrumHub\n\nArbitrumHub is a centralized and open-source platform designed to streamline user access to essential resources, real-time updates, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem. It addresses the need for a unified, easily navigable platform for new and existing users. Key functionalities include:\n\n### a.

Initially, our team faced difficulties in accessing the necessary information to fully participate in the ecosystem, a challenge that many users encounter. ArbitrumHub eliminates these barriers, offering a seamless experience that will help attract and retain new members while fostering the continued growth of the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n\n\n# 5. KPI and SOP Implementation\n\nWe have conducted extensive research to establish refined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure that ArbitrumHub operates at peak efficiency while fostering community engagement. Based on feedback received from our initial draft shared on November 30th, we have streamlined  resources towards platform maintenance, and effectively reduced the overall budget.

We are committed to the platform's growth and its relevance in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Notes:\n- This breakdown includes the minimal industry per-hour cost for expert talent, optimized to reduce the hourly commitment of each role while focusing on platform maintenance.\n- The resource allocation and hours have been adjusted based on DAO feedback to ensure efficiency, execution quality, and an appropriate balance of responsibilities for each role.\n- The budget has also been reduced significantly considering the first year being arbitrumhub's pilot to build the strong ground on its relevance and usecases.\n\n## Retroactive Funding \nWe would like to highlight that we have been diligently working on and building this platform over the past year at our own discretion with early starter-grant support from pL labs back in jan-feb 2024. Given the effort and commitment invested for past months at our own discretion, we believe it is reasonable to seek retroactive compensation for the work completed thus far.\n\nWe respectfully request a **minimum of $40k USD** as retroactive funding for over **10+ months of dedicated work**. This request is entirely optional and subject to the discretion of the DAO.\n\nShould the DAO recognize and appreciate our contributions, we would be sincerely grateful. However, if the DAO decides otherwise, we fully understand and respect the decision, acknowledging the dynamics and priorities of the DAO landscape.\n\n\n## Feedback Mechanism and Success Metrics\n\n### Feedback Mechanism\nTo foster continuous improvement and maintain alignment with community/DAO expectations, we have implemented a structured feedback mechanism integrated into our operational processes. This mechanism ensures that insights from users, stakeholders, and the broader community are systematically collected, evaluated, and acted upon.\n\n1. **Community Engagement & Open Collaboration**\n   - **Open Source Accessibility**: open-source GitHub code is public for community contributions.\n   - **Social Media Outreach**: Active Twitter engagement (5 posts/week) to gather feedback.\n   - **Usecases**: One of the key winning factors is to measure platform usage and utility through user activity trends and monthly survey reports, which will help assess satisfaction and identify areas for improvement\u2026\n\n3. **Quarterly Check-ins & Feedback Loops**\n   - **Quarterly Program Reviews**: Program-specific content and feedback are reviewed quarterly. (SOP(a)).\n  \n4. **Platform Analytics & User Behavior Insights**\n   - **User Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time user engagement insights on Looker Studio.\n   - **Quarterly Analytics Reports**: Trends and action plans for improvement (SOP(c)).\n\n5. **Enhancements Based on Requests** \n   - **Requests Evaluation**: Community/DAO requests are prioritized and implemented after review (SOP(b)).\n\n### Success Metrics\nThe success of ArbitrumHub is evaluated using clearly defined metrics that align with the platform\u2019s objectives. These metrics are linked to the KPIs and operational SOPs, ensuring measurable outcomes and accountability.\n\n**Performance Indicators**\n1. **Content Accuracy & Timeliness**: Core focus on platform maintenance and content prevents fragmentation, ensuring that the information is both current and relevant.\n2. **User Engagement & Retention**: Tracked via User Analytics Dashboard, with quarterly reports (SOP(c)).\n3. **Platform Growth & Enhancement**: Measured by new initiatives based on research/community requests (SOP(b)).\n4. **Community Involvement**: Increased contributions on GitHub.\n6. **Communication & Outreach**: 26 newsletters annually; active social media presence (5 posts/week).\n\nThese mechanisms ensure ArbitrumHub operates effectively, adapts to user needs, and fosters a transparent, collaborative environment.\n\n![4e0d0cfe686e3c72e9f72869b101839ecdaa6602_2_936x504[1].png](ipfs://bafybeidcy7va4kcwmay7uchl3uy5fnz5hdryx5embo5hlimdjb5tqpocwu)\n\n## Key Revisions Based on Feedback:\n\n- **Focus on Platform Maintenance and information accuracy**:  \n  Dedicated efforts on platform upkeep for the entire year, avoiding fragmentation.\n\n- **Reduced Fragmentation**: Prioritized a focused approach to consolidate resources and streamline efforts, ensuring a solid foundation for ArbitrumHub.\n\n- **Revised Role Hours**:  \n  Streamlined hours per role, focusing on platform maintenance based on DAO feedback.\n\n- **Revised Budget**:  \n  Optimized budget with clear justification for every expenditure.\n\n- **Defined Target Audiences**:  \n  Focused efforts on meeting the needs of clearly identified target audiences.\n\n\n ## Commitment to Excellence\n\nThis proposal reflects our dedication to creating a platform that prioritizes transparency, community engagement, and measurable success. By addressing past challenges and proactively improving key aspects, we are confident that this revised approach will meet the expectations of stakeholders and deliver meaningful value to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe look forward to the support of DAO & community in taking this forward.\n\n ## Voting Option & Governance timeline\n1. **For with retroactive**\n2. **For without retroactive**\n3. **Abstain**\n4. **Against**\n\nThank you.\n\n![b66f10c30c406b2c7e78277483c92595d54cbb9a_2_936x535[1].jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiawhmzctqd4e4eerabcchbjh2azfsvvs3naqrq55izdqmgfpbqkam)", "match_confidence": 0.9123, "match_method": "fuzzy_title"}, {"id": "fc9e4d45-86c6-43d7-9865-0c89bda9a1f6", "proposal_id": null, "snapshot_id": "0x4ed98bf0a5018d9ff80780d97d76a7fe9ba11c6c9cd01ab336936d9f400f3087", "title": "Timeswap STIP Proposal - Round 1", "author_name": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD", "url": "https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ed98bf0a5018d9ff80780d97d76a7fe9ba11c6c9cd01ab336936d9f400f3087", "status": "closed", "voting_start": "2023-10-06 02:00:00", "voting_end": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "options": {"scores": [182671117.7552063, 5052186.109727629, 11733327.364343932], "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"]}, "last_activity": "2023-10-13 02:00:00", "updated_at": "2026-01-28 08:40:01.289", "body": "This is a proposal for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), you can find the details of this specific protocol\u2019s proposal in the forum link attached below.\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program comprises up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols.\n\nTo succeed, an application must reach a 71.51M ARB Quorum and receive more than 50% of votes in favor of the proposal. \n\nSuccessful applicants will receive funding following coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig.

This will be used as a project buffer with funds either deployed in support of the program, recycled into ecosystem development or returned to Arbitrum DAO.\n\nSuccessful completion of these deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This success of this program will be assessed through metrics including, but not limited to:\n\n* Number of active developers\n* Dev Github quality\n* Delegate engagement satisfaction\n* Voter participation\n* Capture-resistance\n\n### Deliverables\n\nAt the end of Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n**Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops**\n\n* Conduct Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values workshops\n* Clearly define funding priorities in a bottom-up way\n* Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n* Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n**Design | Construct best in class Pluralistic Grants Program**\n\n* Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n* Design and process map the end to end grant funding flows\n* Design approach, process and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n* Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n* Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n* Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n**Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs**\n\n* Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n* Deploy 2.6 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n* Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n* Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n**Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes**\n\n* Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n* Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n* Collate community feedback and input on grants programs efficacy and success\n* Evaluate, review and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow their ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum\u2019s ability to actualize its full potential. It\u2019s easy to say, \u201cwe can solve these problems later\u201d, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n### Issues with fully Centralized and Decentralized Grants Programs\n\nWithin web3 we have seen three main vehicles by which Grants Funding can be allocated to builders. Below we have outlined why we believe Arbitrum DAO should take a pluralist approach to grants funding.\n\n### Centralised Grants Program: Problems\n \n![0311b2837f5d19e1de6302c085e0eb8b800963cf_2_624x345.png](ipfs://bafkreidp5ob5oiuy77fqrklknkgy2jujbdeavyhhxyxptnaar7txya4ybu)\n    \n* Limited transparency and auditability: A centrally managed grants program may lack transparency in decision-making processes, grant distribution, and fund allocation. This opacity can undermine trust and hinder the overall effectiveness of the program\n* Limited community participation: Web3 communities thrive on active participation and collaboration. A centrally managed grants program may not effectively engage community members at all levels of the organization in the decision-making and codesign processes.\n* Domain expertise and scale: Volume of grants requests may overwhelm capacity of small centralized team who may also lack domain specific expertise on programs requesting funding\n* Bias and limited experimentation: Centralized Grants teams bring their standardized approach to grant vetting leading to a lack of experimentation which creates an inherent selection bias. The selection bias can even be non-malicious as they are biased by forces like being more likely to \u201copen the door\u201d for those who they know or have worked with before.h.\n\n### Decentralised Grants Program: Problems\n\n![b5cb3f790e8de949030775b29bba6030f6ef6421_2_624x287.png](ipfs://bafkreidqzewoyc2jyhr6a5mbqrcaml4cowvjqbp7bmtjgpzyfe2hqcwcbe)\n    \n* Lack of time: Delegates will stop engaging if the request is for more than is reasonable. Reviewing a grant, especially if it is a direct grant for larger amounts can be expected to take from 1-4 hours each. Delegates cannot take that much time.\n* Inclusion and accessibility: Navigating the delegates and governance process of a large DAO represents a major lift for any prospective grants applicants. Those able to do so will likely have the best network and most capital, not necessarily the best grants ideas\u2026\n* Lack of coordination: With a decentralized grants program, decision-making and coordination are distributed among multiple stakeholders. This can lead to challenges in achieving consensus, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities.\n* Evaluation of impact: It is challenging for the DAO to assess the relative impact of different grants programs if no standardized reporting cadence, key metrics and evaluation criteria is maintained centrally.\n* Mitigating risks and fraud: Decentralized grants programs are vulnerable to risks such as fraudulent proposals, mismanagement of funds, and malicious actors. Implementing mechanisms for due diligence, verification, reputation systems and Sybil defense can help mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of grants funding.\n* Not fully developed: Even solutions like quadratic funding which lets users directly express their interest still require a program manager. They must shepherd the round and ensure quality fraud protection while making objective decisions about eligibility criteria, user and project appeals, and more. Until we design the open and permissionless protocol to handle these subjective components, the model still has single points of failure.\n\n### Launching the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the \u201cbest of both worlds.\n\nAt its core the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefits the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\n![0e9c91acb14f197ac0396d79f28b7f530aedfd36_2_624x363.png](ipfs://bafkreiaumlf7kbilxwrxnx7hixajjiz5pzbpr73ciybkkgdnbqsjefqzru)\n    \n> \ud83d\udca1The Pluralist Grants Programs will be selected after the proposal passes governance and the Discovery Phase is completed.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs has struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n* Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n* Create a backlog of \u201chigh impact work to be done\u201d be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n* Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the \u201chigh impact work that needs to be done\u201d\n* Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n* Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n* Domain expertise and knowledge\n* Ability to source innovate grants projects and support in the maintenance of a health pipeline of grants submission\n* Maturity of program specific processes and tooling\n* Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of mechanism\n* Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n\nThis is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\n\nThis is not payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to grant recipients in a Gitcoin Arbitrum round we intend to launch. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users which might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem, but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n![88d617338384427ed53607b929264bc8b623ef43_2_624x281.png](ipfs://bafkreiaylf4ugerhg5c755rx2ffjydpjcri6sx7mohjrafoiuylihkijfy)\n    \n### Improved Accountability, Transparency and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model.\n\nWeb3 spends 100\u2019s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spend. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant-execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects, while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n### Multisig Management\n\nAll funds will be sent to a Grants Safety Multisig*. This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program. The role of the grants multisig is to process the requests made by Plurality Labs while also being able to review issues. At no point will Plurality Labs hold the funds designated for grant funding. The final form of this proposal will either name the selected individual or state the electoral process.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n### Team\n\nPlurality Labs Team\n\n**Disruption Joe**\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million.

In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\n\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures. They will provide a breakdown at that time based on how this project evolves.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. After Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for this whole process to run on chain.\n\nIf successful, Plurality Labs would no longer be needed as a project manager of the overall grants program. Onchain decisions of the community would allocate funding to the programs which have been proven useful. Plurality labs could then be an equal peer to any other program competing for a portion of continuous funding available to the ecosystem.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n1.
